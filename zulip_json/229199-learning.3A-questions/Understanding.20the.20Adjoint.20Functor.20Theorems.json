We assume that the domain of <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>G</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">G</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">G</span></span></span></span> has a coseparating set - together with completeness, this implies that the unit of the codensity monad is monic. In other words, you can \"embed\" any object of the domain into a product of objects in the coseparating set. This lets you cut down the weighted limit for the Kan extension in a slightly different way, reducing it to an expression involving only the cogenerators.</p>\n<p>Is that about right? More generally I'm trying to understand the significance of these theorems - it feels like we can separate the proofs into the right kan extension formula, and then various strategies to compute these weighted limits in categories of interest.</p>",
