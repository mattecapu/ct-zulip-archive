Then look at the Pos-enriched functor category [C^op, Pos].</p>",

A fuzzy subset H ⊆ G, thought of as a map into the subobject classifier, assigns to each element of G(E) a value in [0,1] saying with what weight the element is in the subset.  As an object of the topos, I think H(E) is a poset where the elements are ordered by their weights, H(V) is the poset F ≤ T, and H(x)(e) is T if 1-x ≤ weight(e) and F otherwise.  We say an element has weight 0 if H(x) is always F and weight 1 if it's always T.</p>",
