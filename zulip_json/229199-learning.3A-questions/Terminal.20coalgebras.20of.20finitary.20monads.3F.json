I'm particularly interested in Lawvere theories with models in CompSet (computably enumerable sets and computable functions).  The specific theory I'm looking at is the theory of Heyting algebras, with binary function symbols for ∧, ∨, and →, nullary symbols for ⊤ and ⊥, and the equations relating them; it's not clear to me whether the corresponding monad has a terminal coalgebra.  </p>\n<p>Does algebraic freedom mean that presentations of the theory lack equations (that is, the theory is generated only by an algebraic signature rather than a signature plus equations)?
