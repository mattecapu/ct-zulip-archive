We can tell a similar story for stable infinity categories and modules over E1 ring spectra. What sort of general class do semiring module categories fit into? This is a hazy question, but I hope it makes sense what I'm looking for. Probably this comes down to something like \"what exactness properties are true of the category N-Mod of commutative monoids\"</p>",
