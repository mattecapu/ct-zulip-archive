So first you push out along another coproduct, which I think should give you the coproduct of the two individual pushouts by general nonsense about adjoints, and then you get the coequalizer of the two.  Is this right?  (If so it's an answer, but maybe not the ideal answer -- I'd like to have one that gives some idea of how much meaningful gluing is going on and how much is just the images missing each other, and how you get a mix of quotientyness and coproductyness.)</p>",
