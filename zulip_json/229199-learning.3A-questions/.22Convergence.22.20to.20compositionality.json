        "content": "<p>As has been pointed out in this forum by Jules Hedges (and maybe others), and is general knowledge in the field of optimization, optimization problems are not compositional, unless trivially so (i.e., they are independent such that they don't share variables or constraints). Recent work involving convex optimization (like with convex bifunctions) gets at ways to directly compose optimization problems and the resulting category does in fact have some nice additional hypergraph structure. But, such composition amounts to a solution of one problem becoming a perturbation of the next problem's constraints, which is basically just currying the convex function, as was pointed out by Stein/Samuelson at ACT-23. </p>\n<p>However, and sort of the main point I am getting at, in practice there are ways of solving such problems anyway. Of \"creating\" non-trivial compositionality, perhaps. In other words, it is generally a common solution technique to <em>iteratively</em> solve a set of subproblems and force them to converge to an overall solution, which is in fact optimal for the composed problem, but may be (and probably will be) sub-optimal for any of the subproblems in isolation. So coordination acts to broker the set of sub-solutions toward a common goal. </p>\n<p>So we still have \"non-compositionality\" since optimality remains not compositional. The <em>optimal</em> solutions of the subproblems still do not directly compose into the overall <em>optimal</em> solution. However, we have in some sense side-stepped the issue by switching back and forth between the subproblems and the overall problem via a coordination mechanism, allowing one or the other (sub- or overall-) solutions to be sub-optimal as needed. In optimization, this mechanism often operates via principles of duality.</p>\n<p>Is there any categorical notion which might capture this idea of iterative \"forcing\" of compositionality? Perhaps convergence would be a better term. For example, has anyone used a higher-category model which can capture iteration, convergence, coordination, or something similar as higher morphisms?</p>",

Once baked, it is never kneaded again of course. I would interpret the iteration portion of their method to involve the oven process receiving the dough and deciding that the gluten is not developed enough and that it needs more kneading, thus the first kneading process is iterated once more. I'm curious if there is some way of sending additional information back, more than just \"try again.\" To continue the example, perhaps something like: \"you (subprocesses) thought this was good dough. To me, this is lacking in XYZ quantity. Update your level of kneading accordingly and try again.\"</p>\n<p>*Edit: Actually, the dough is being passed <em>down the line.</em> There is a clear dependency/directionality here. So, you are correct, but the nuance I am trying to grab hold of is something being passed to a coordinator, which then makes a decision on whether to reiterate and also influences the reiteration. So in this case, I am thinking of the oven subprocess as existing \"above\" the kneading subprocess. But of course the oven may exist \"below\" some other process, too.</p>",

This is a good source for describing basics of category theory, too for any beginners who might be interested. It also has a partial focus on philosophical considerations, which I find interesting apart from the math.</p>",

A footnote from there:</p>\n<p>''16. Modules play a large role in much of mathematical music theory, especially variants of R{O, P, L, D} and the module of integers mod 12 (under addition), together with its affine transformations. At least as far back as Lewin (see Lewin (2010), originally published in 1987), transformations between musical elements (instead of musical objects like the C major chord) became the focus of many music theorists, where the transformations in question often form a group. Certain elements of algebra, especially group theory, have accordingly been used for some time to systematize the treatment of common operations on musical chords, and geometrical models of musical structure have also been considered by a few authors (such as Tymoczko (2011)). Approaches to questions of music theory that incorporate category theory (starting with Mazzola (1985)) are somewhat harder to come by, but the reader curious about more category theoretic takes on music may find interesting Popoff, Andreatta, and Ehresmann (2018), Noll (2005), and the work of Guerino Mazzola and followers. The module R{O, P, L, D} presented above, together with further uses of it, is discussed in Mazzola and Andreatta (2006).''</p>",
