One reason, is that this is how natural cotransformations were defined in Aguiar's thesis <a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/Aguiar_InternalCategoriesAndQuantumGroups.pdf\">p39</a>.  The second and more important reason is that these are the kind of 2-cells which arise naturally from the formal theory of monads II.  For a 2-category K, there is a 2-category EM(K) and when we restrict to morphisms of monads whose 1-cell component is a left adjoint, you get the 2-category of categories, cofunctors, and conatural transformations.</p>",
