There is a general result that <em>monadic</em> functors create <em>limits</em>, and so dually comonadic functors create colimits, but those would be functors with right adjoints (worth noting that being comonadic is not preserved by composition but the property of creating (co)limits is).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sorry about bringing this up again. So say A is a full, isomorphism-closed, reflective subcategory of B and let U : A → B be the embedding. Given a diagram D : I → A such that the colim U ∘ D exists,  then F (colim U ∘ D) ≅ colim (F ∘ U ∘ D) ≅ colim D, where the first ≅ follows from F preserving colimits and the last ≅ follows from the full, isomorphism-closed part, right?</p>\n<p>Because A is full, isomorphism-closed and reflective, U is monadic. Being monadic means that U creates all colimits that exist in B and are preserved by UF and UFUF. But in the F (colim U ∘ D) ≅  colim D \"proof\", I didn't make use of the fact that UF and UFUF preserve colimits, so something is not right.</p>",
