Note that while regularity implies the existence of some coequalizers, and exactness implies the existence of more, an exact category need not have all coequalizers (only coequalizers of congruences), whereas a regular category can be cocomplete without being exact.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A similar statement can be found in section A1.3 of Johnstone's <em>Elephant</em>, but I have never seen an example of a parallel pair of morphisms in a regular category which did not have a coequalizer. Does anyone know of such a pathological example?</p>",

Thus a regular category is a category with finite limits and coequalizers of <em>kernel pairs</em>, satisfying certain exactness conditions; while an exact category is a category with finite limits and coequalizers of <em>equivalence relations</em>, satisfying certain exactness conditions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>This strikes me as an incorrect assessment</strong>: the classic example of a regular category which is not exact is the category of torsion-free abelian groups, <a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/regular+and+exact+completions#examples\">see here</a> (although I do not understand the content of the commentary which begins \"Herein lies a subtle trap for the unwary\"...) which <em>has all coequalizers</em> and so in particular has coequalizers of all equivalence relations.
