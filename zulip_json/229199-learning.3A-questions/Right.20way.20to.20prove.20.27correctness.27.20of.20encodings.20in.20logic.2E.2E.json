So, I could have (meta)logical statements like <code>IsZFCProvable(phi) == ∃proof: IsZFCProof(phi, proof)</code>.

I don't think this is what people mean when they say 'constructing a model'. Is there a well-known name for this idea?</li>\n<li>I think that you could even encode zfc in Peano arithmetic.
