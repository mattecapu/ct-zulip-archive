In fact, the result you mention has a generalization: the 2-category of strict algebras and lax morphisms for any 2-monad inherits products from products in its base category.  This is Corollary 4.9 of Lack's <a href=\"http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~slack/papers/talgl.pdf\">Limits for lax morphisms</a>.  This implies the question you ask about, since there is a 2-monad whose strict algebras are lax monoidal categories (and another one whose strict algebras are the usual kind of \"pseudo\" monoidal categories).</p>",
