But we do have that P(ω)^M is a subset of P(ω). So there must be a set of natural numbers X (in fact, continuum many) which is undefinable in the model. Note X is not finite and so externally there exists a bijection ω -&gt; X. Composing with the inclusion we get a function ω -&gt; M which is necessarily not definable, because if it was then its image X would be an element of M. This kind of thing is ruled out by a grothendieck universe. It's extremely important if we want to pass back and forth between grothendieck universes that \"the small powerset of a small set is its actual powerset\", and this is not captured by just a transitive model of ZFC</p>",
