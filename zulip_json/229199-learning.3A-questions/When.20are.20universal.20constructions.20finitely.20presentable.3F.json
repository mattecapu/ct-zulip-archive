Limits in Abelian categories are uniquely characterized by their computational properties, maybe something similar could be applied to ordinary categories somehow. Universals are the same as representables, but that requires a notion of representation <a href=\"http://homotopy.io\">homotopy.io</a> doesn't provide (and you'd need a Yoneda structure in your category-of-categories anyway)</p>",
