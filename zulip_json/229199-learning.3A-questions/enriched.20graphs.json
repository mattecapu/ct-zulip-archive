You might have a rule for example that whenever you \"find\" a graph G inside a graph H you \"replace\" G with H. Then you may chain these replacements together in increasingly complicated ways.  Deciding what exactly you mean by \"find\" and \"replace\" requires a certain amount of care, and I think the most common approach is to use double pushout rewriting. I could tell you a bit about that sometime if you like.</p>",

I don't see how adjunctions could yield new theorems in graph theory. The fact that adjoints preserve (co)limits is quite useful sometimes and can yield elegant proofs (the same is true for the Yoneda lemma), but I doubt it can do more than that.

Then we hope to compute resistance in the network using an analogue of the free category construction. </p>\n<p>In the simplest case we just have a graph X ---R--- Y. As a directed graph, there are arrows in both directions, so infinitely many paths from X to Y. However, when we compute the resistance between X and Y, we <em>don't</em> want to include any of the loops.</p>\n<p>Following my nose, we ought to add in a reflexive loop at each nodes with zero resistance (edit: I guess this is the identity). This would short-circuit the computation of Hom(X,X) to yield zero, which seems promising. Then we go to compute Hom(X,Y), and I want to replace the infinite loopy sum with the hom-object Hom(X,X). Perhaps via quotient on the free category?</p>\n<p>Anyway, I would be happy for either techinical suggestions or references to similar issues. Thanks!</p>",
