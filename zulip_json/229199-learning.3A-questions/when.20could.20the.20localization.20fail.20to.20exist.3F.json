I think I can show that the zig-zag construction given there is general, and e.g. Borceux (Proposition I.5.2.2 of <em>Handbook of Categorical Algebra</em>) asserts that it always exists via the same construction, although Borceux is proving a slightly different universal property (Borceux's is essentially 1-categorical, whereas the nlab's is 2-categorical). I just want to make sure I'm not missing something strange that can break with the version of the universal property on that page.</p>\n<p>(Thanks in advance!)</p>",
