        "content": "<p>As described in Part 0 of Lambek &amp; Scott, many duality theorems between algebra and geometry, such as Stone duality, Pontrjagin duality and Gelfand duality, arise as follows: there's a special mathematical entity E that can be regarded both as an object of an algebraic category Alg and as an object of a geometric category Geo (so it's both a space and an algebraic structure). (In the context of Stone duality E is Z/(2), which is both a ring and a topological space; in the context of Pontrjagin duality E is R/Z, which is both an abelian group and a topological abelian group.) Then one considers two functors: to each space X in Geo one assigns the object Hom(X,E) of Alg (its algebraic structure is inherited by that of E) and, similarly, to each \"algebra\" A one assigns the object Hom(A,E) of Geo. Hopefully, these two contravariant functors Alg -&gt; Geo and Geo -&gt; Alg constitute a pair of adjoint functors and restrict to an equivalence between two interesting subcategories of Alg and Geo^op.<br>\nIt's interesting that this pattern shows up again and again, the nLab has a whole page about it: <a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/duality+between+algebra+and+geometry\">https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/duality+between+algebra+and+geometry</a>. My question is: can we make the analogy between all these dualities precise? Is there a hidden categorical principle behind all these dualities that generalizes the phenomenon described above?<br>\nI picked up the book <em>Stone spaces</em> by Johnstone and saw that chapter VI contains an approach to generalizing these kinds of dualities via ind- and pro-completions. But this doesn't look like what I'm searching for (I want to see a generalization of the process of picking the special object E and then considering Hom(-,E)).<br>\nAlso, what I find a bit mysterious: how to pick the right E?</p>",
