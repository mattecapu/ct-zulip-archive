I usually refer to Etingof's book on tensor categories or Aguiar's book on species, since they are popular and develop the theory with details, but I am not sure they are \"canonical\". There are the chapters on MacLane as well, while Riehl and Leinster decided to skip moncats in their books.</p>",
