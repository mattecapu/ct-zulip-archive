I have been following Statebox, but alas, am hard at work on a set of projects using more primitive programming languages. Maybe in my next life, or maybe I can find a project using Statebox to manage distributed economic networks (my focus), or maybe somebody involved with Statebox wants to start one?</p>",

I see some really interesting and promising ideas amongst them, but mostly over my head given my infant stage of acquaintance with category theory. I will dig into some of them and see if I can understand.</p>",
