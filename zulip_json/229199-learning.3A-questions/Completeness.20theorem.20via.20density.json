Likewise, any Lawvere theory is dense in its category of algebras. More generally, the Kleisli category of any monad is dense in the Eilenberg-Moore category. When the monad has arities, the free algebras on just those arities are dense in the Eilenberg-Moore category (e.g. how the first three walking ordinals are dense in <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mtext>Cat</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\text{Cat}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord text\"><span class=\"mord\">Cat</span></span></span></span></span>).</p>\n<p>These could all be seen as 'completeness theorems'. Can this be extended to other forms of logic (e.g. regular, geometric, etc...) and how does this connect to the traditional formulation of the completeness theorem (if a statement is true in all models then its true from the theory).</p>",
