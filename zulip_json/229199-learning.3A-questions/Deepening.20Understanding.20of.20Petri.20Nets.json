A way of putting a bunch of tokens in the places gives an&nbsp;<em>object</em>&nbsp;of this category, and a way of moving them around repeatedly (as above) gives a&nbsp;<em>morphism</em>.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Particularly, that moving the tokens in the places gives an object of the monoidal category. Later in the post, it says that petri nets are \"rigidly collectivist\" but this feels slightly contradictory to me based on the photo provided in the blog post here: <br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/pn8RcZBMULSNhlNqzbR8T39U/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/pn8RcZBMULSNhlNqzbR8T39U/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img data-original-dimensions=\"939x201\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/21317/pn8RcZBMULSNhlNqzbR8T39U/image.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div><p>My understanding is that the three orientations of the tokens in the single petri net each represent objects of the monoidal category (I am ignoring how morphisms were defined for now). How are petri nets \"rigidly collectivist\" when it seems like the location of the tokens in each \"place\" gives rise to objects in this category? To me, it seems like we would say that there is only ever three tokens in this petri net which would imply one object given the \"rigidly collectivist\" rules to generate an object in the monoidal category.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>i.e. based on this statement: \"<em>In the so-called &lsquo;individual token philosophy&rsquo;, we allow a finite set of tokens in each place. In the &lsquo;collective token philosophy&rsquo;, we merely allow a natural number of tokens in each place. It&rsquo;s like the difference between having 4 individual workers named John, Fabrizio, Jade and Mike where you can tell who did what, and having 4 anonymous workers: nameless drones.</em>\"</p>\n</blockquote>",

I know you say in the blog post that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A <strong>Petri net</strong>, as we use the term, consists of a set <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>S</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">S</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.05764em;\">S</span></span></span></span>, a set <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">T</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.13889em;\">T</span></span></span></span>, and a function <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo>→</mo><mi mathvariant=\"double-struck\">N</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mi>S</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo><mo>×</mo><mi mathvariant=\"double-struck\">N</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mi>S</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">T \\rightarrow \\N[S] \\times \\N[S]</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.13889em;\">T</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">→</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathbb\">N</span><span class=\"mopen\">[</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.05764em;\">S</span><span class=\"mclose\">]</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222em;\"></span><span class=\"mbin\">×</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathbb\">N</span><span class=\"mopen\">[</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.05764em;\">S</span><span class=\"mclose\">]</span></span></span></span>, where <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"double-struck\">N</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mi>S</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\N[S]</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathbb\">N</span><span class=\"mopen\">[</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.05764em;\">S</span><span class=\"mclose\">]</span></span></span></span> is the underlying set of the free commutative monoid on <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>S</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">S</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.05764em;\">S</span></span></span></span>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So are the morphisms defined as a map from marking to marking that records the position of tokens within each place (which I think follows the \"individualist\" tradition you mentioned)?

And the form of composition makes a big difference if the idea is to obtain a functorial account of Petri nets behaviour---by that, I mean a (symmetric monoidal) functor between a category which hosts the syntax of nets as combinatorial objects,  and another category in which they take their semantics. This is what is sometimes referred to as <em>compositionality</em> in this context. </p>\n<p>I and several others have worked on the algebra of nets composed along transitions, <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290338\">giving them a presentation</a> as a symmetric monoidal theory, with generators and relations.  While it was interesting work, connected to other seemingly unrelated formalisms, like signal flow graphs for linear dynamical systems, our presentation only gave an account of the one-step behaviour of a given net, that is, how the number of tokens in its places can change from firing (potentially multiple simultaneous) transitions once. This does not tackle what researchers in the field really care about, namely which configurations can be reached from which (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_net#Reachability\">reachability</a>, a problem whose complexity was pinned down fairly recently) or useful related questions (like <em>coverability</em>, for example). It would have been great to gain some insight into these complicated problems using the algebraic tools we have developed, but I was unable to achieve anything substantial at the time, and have not gone back to them since.

I really loved your further explanations and additional paper references (I have them pulled up to look at). Also, your work sounds really fascinating -- it just so happened I stumbled across your blog post <em><a href=\"https://piedeleu.com/posts/diagrammatic-causal-inference/\">An introduction to causal inference via string diagrams</a></em> a while ago as well so it is exciting to cross paths! That said, I wanted to respond to one point you mentioned:</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"277342\">Robin Piedeleu</span> <a href=\"#narrow/stream/229199-learning.3A-questions/topic/Deepening.20Understanding.20of.20Petri.20Nets/near/455411223\">said</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And the form of composition makes a big difference if the idea is to obtain a functorial account of Petri nets behaviour---by that, I mean a (symmetric monoidal) functor between a category which hosts the syntax of nets as combinatorial objects, and another category in which they take their semantics.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What do you mean by a category hosting the syntax of nets as combinatorial objects? Is this referring to markings?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here by \"syntax\" I mean a combinatorial description of a Petri net---basically, just a (directed) hypergraph! Of course, to turn these into \"open\" Petri nets and organise them into a category, we usually consider some sort of cospan of hypergraph, whose legs indicate which of the places/transition - there is a choice, as I said above - are available to be composed with the environment. </p>\n<p>But, this is just syntax, in the sense that it tells us almost nothing about why we usually care about Petri nets: they are systems whose combinatorial description specifies which transitions can be fired in what state (i.e. tokens in some places). This is their semantics. There are also several possible interpretations here, but this is the general idea. And often, you can organise these semantics into a (symmetric monoidal) category too. For example, for the usual interpretation of plain Petri nets, this category is simply the category of sets and relations. For nets with rates who fire in continuous time, see the work of John and his coauthors. Then, when we're lucky, there is a (symmetric monoidal) functor from the syntax to the semantics, which guarantees that the interpretation is compositional, aka \"black-boxing\" as John calls it above. </p>\n<p>However, as I said, this only holds, as far as I'm aware, for the one-step behaviour of the net; more interesting and complicated properties like the reachability relation (which is just the transition closure of the former) do not usually give such a functor. Studying when symmetric monoidal functoriality break down might provide some insight into why some of these other properties are more complex to compute btw.</p>",
