There is a one-sorted \"just arrows\" presentation and a two sorted \"objects and arrows\" presentation of (1-)categories. This can be lifted to 2-categories; there are 1, 2 and 3-sorted presentations of 2-categories, and perhaps you're describing what these look like for the 2-category of categories.</p>",
