First of all, there are examples like <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"416301\">@Zhen Lin Low</span> gave, where general features of the internal logic of a topos of sheaves on a space correspond to properties of that space. The other one that is well-studied is the weaker property of the internal logic being \"de Morgan\" (no relation). Contrary to what Zhen Lin said, it's actually this property that corresponds to extremal disconnectedness. The topos of sheaves on a space is Boolean if and only if the space is discrete. Further properties of the internal logic constrain subobject lattices, and for toposes of sheaves on spaces, it's typically necessary and sufficient to consider the impact on the lattice of subterminals.</p>\n<p>Second, there is another face of logic in topos theory, which is only tangentially related to the internal language: the theory of classifying topos. This face of logic is used to construct instances of locales (spaces) with no points; I can try and convince you of the importance of these if you like.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Like can we go from Lindstrom's theorem to something meaningful about topologies maybe?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since Lindstr√∂m's theorem concerns properties of models of theories in first-order logic, it would more properly be interpreted via classifying toposes, although you would need to talk about functors which preserve the structure needed to interpret first-order logic (which is distinct from the structure interpreting geometric logic), and so you're already outside the realm of what's been extensively examined in topos theory there.</p>",
