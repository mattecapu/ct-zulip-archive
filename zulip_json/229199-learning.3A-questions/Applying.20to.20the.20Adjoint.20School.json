Here they are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What makes a successful application to the adjoint school? I have heard it is quite competitive and want to start thinking ahead about how best to prepare.</li>\n<li>I heard and read that potential applicants could come forward with their own ideas of a topic/project to pursue. What would be the best way to present and polish up those ideas?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thanks folks and I am happy to add clarification as needed! Hoping this could also help with answering questions other potential applicants may have! </p>\n<p>(Also, cc <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"275920\">@John Baez</span> from an earlier conversation)</p>",
