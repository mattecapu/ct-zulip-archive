        "content": "<p>Hi everyone. I just want to know the mindset, the feels and the struggles from everyone while doing and approaching research in math or problems in math in general starting from when they were a beginner up to expert level / any level that they are currently in.</p>\n<p>Let's start with me. I am a complete beginner. Right now, doing math for me is like programming a computer. It starts with an idea or problem or both. Then, I start to break down the problems into smaller parts that I can manage and approach one by one before I can see the whole picture. Currently, I feel like i am struggling to learn more about the syntax of the programming language, the rules, the dos and donts, the collections of libraries that people have developed, the paradigm or pattern that people have used to solve problems and maybe more that i dont know of...</p>\n<p>With computers, we can't just use our language (which is full of nuances and subtleties, deep meanings, not rigorous)  and tell them what we want them to do. We have to translate our ideas down to their language before they can execute them.<br>\nBut, (I don't know if this true in general) the difference is... with computers, we have all these compilers, user-friendly editors and environments that can point out our mistakes and errors (even though they can't point out some/many bugs). With math, it feels like you are writing a program using a piece of paper and pencil without all those programming tools and have to manually compile your program in your head, checking line by line.</p>\n<p>I don't know but suspect that maybe some people are fortunate enough to have this \"compiler\" in their mind that makes them breeze thru the whole process.</p>\n<p>Thank you for sharing. This will help me build the right intuition and mindset along the journey.</p>",

I'll give you my perspective as a \"pure\" mathematician.<br>\nThe nice thing about maths is that (unless you're doing something super applied like fluid dynamics where you have to develop some physical intuition in order to have any idea what assumptions to make in order to make progress) you typically start with all of the assumed facts in front of you. In an exercise provided in a textbook or course, you'll be given a formal description of all of the ingredients, and the challenge is to perform the mental gymnastics that transforms those facts into the desired conclusion. In research, on the other hand, you have to add the work at either end of collecting the formal descriptions of the ingredients and identifying what the desired conclusions might be.</p>",

For example, going from seeing the definition of a group to showing that any finite group with an even number of elements contains an element of order 2 takes a few leaps of imagination. The mental gymnastics is quite different for solving differential equations, where the creativity lies in identifying which of the techniques in your tool-box is applicable.<br>\nIn category theory, the gymnastics you need to learn is that of manipulating the various gadgets that one finds in categories. Diagram chasing (and diagram building!), understanding results about limits and colimits and how these interact, flipping back and forth across adjunctions... all take practice, but there are lots of good textbooks and courses out there to help with that.</p>",

Yes, you can build some tall pinnacles before you start the lower floors somewhere else, but overall, you need to approach it from the bottom-up.<br>\nSo don't get discouraged! You don't need to be an 'expert' in the easy things, but you certainly need to have seen them. The ideas, the intuitions, the techniques, will slowly train your brain to think 'in the right way' to grasp high-level math.<br>\nMy suggestion thus is to make baby steps. Learn some linear algebra, euclidean geometry, calculus, logic, etc, and then build on them.<br>\nPlus, ironically <em>there are compilers for math</em>, they're called proof assistants. People like Kevin Buzzard make a case of using them to teach undegraduates, which I think is a very good thing. They force you to think things through and, most importantly, they actually check the proofs you write down. Heck, most can even write chunks themselves! So if you like fiddling with programming, you could try something like Lean, or Agda.</p>",

This stage generally lasts until the early undergraduate years.<br>\n2) The “rigorous” stage, in which one is now taught that in order to do maths “properly”, one needs to work and think in a much more precise and formal manner (e.g. re-doing calculus by using epsilons and deltas all over the place). The emphasis is now primarily on theory; and one is expected to be able to comfortably manipulate abstract mathematical objects without focusing too much on what such objects actually “mean”. This stage usually occupies the later undergraduate and early graduate years.<br>\n3) The “post-rigorous” stage, in which one has grown comfortable with all the rigorous foundations of one’s chosen field, and is now ready to revisit and refine one’s pre-rigorous intuition on the subject, but this time with the intuition solidly buttressed by rigorous theory. (For instance, in this stage one would be able to quickly and accurately perform computations in vector calculus by using analogies with scalar calculus, or informal and semi-rigorous use of infinitesimals, big-O notation, and so forth, and be able to convert all such calculations into a rigorous argument whenever required.) The emphasis is now on applications, intuition, and the “big picture”. This stage usually occupies the late graduate years and beyond.</p>\n</blockquote>",
