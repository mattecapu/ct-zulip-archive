To make it precise one needs to figure out how to combine even permutations with face and degeneracy maps into a category that doesn't include <em>all</em> maps between finite sets.</p>\n<p>Simplicial sets are presheaves on the category of finite <em>totally ordered</em> nonempty sets and <em>order-preserving</em> maps.  (We usually use a skeleton of this category but from a certain viewpoint that's not such a big deal.)</p>\n<p>Symmetric simplical sets are presheaves on the category of nonempty finite sets and <em>all</em> maps.</p>\n<p>You seem to want a category of <em>oriented</em> nonempty finite sets and <em>orientation-preserving</em> (or \"even\") maps.  I don't know if such a category exists.</p>\n<p>An <strong>orientation</strong> on a finite set is, roughly, a choice of which total orderings of that set count as \"right-handed\" and which count as \"left-handed\", subject to the consistency condition that an even permutation applied to ordering preserves its handedness, while an odd permutation reverses it.    You can read about a similar concept for vector spaces here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wikipedia, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientation_(vector_space)\">Orientation (vector space)</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The concept of orientation for finite sets is for some reason less widely known.</p>\n<p>There's a perfectly fine groupoid of oriented nonempty finite sets and orientation-preserving <em>bijections</em>.  This has as a skeleton the groupoid where the objects are n = 1, 2, 3, ... and the morphisms, all automorphisms, are elements of the alternating groups <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>A</mi><mi>n</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">A_n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.83333em;vertical-align:-0.15em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">A</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t vlist-t2\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.151392em;\"><span style=\"top:-2.5500000000000003em;margin-left:0em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal mtight\">n</span></span></span></span><span class=\"vlist-s\">​</span></span><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.15em;\"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>.</p>\n<p>The question becomes: which maps between oriented sets of <em>different</em> cardinalities count as orientation-preserving???
