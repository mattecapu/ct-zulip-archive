        "content": "<p>You're asking why it's \"not expressible in a foundation of sets and proper classes\"? I expect it's a matter of perceived limitations on what can be constructed in set/proper class foundations. To make formal the domain of the functor, you need to construct the product of functor categories between large categories. In simple foundations, the collection of functors can be 'too large' to form a proper class that one can take to be the objects of the functor category... A more nuanced resolution of size issues is typically enough to address this, I think.</p>",
