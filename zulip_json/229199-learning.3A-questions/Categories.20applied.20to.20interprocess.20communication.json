There are different ways to send messages. Sometimes it's enough that one node attempts to message another and is done with the task. At other times, the sending node wants an acknowledgement (or nack) before it finishes the transaction.</p>\n<p>And possibly either side of the communication may want to do something differently depending on the success of the transaction.</p>\n<p>Has anyone seen any exploration of this kind of the whole ecosystem of messaging?  I would appreciate pointers to the most basic parts of it.</p>",
