However, I would also like to know about more possiblities of the real world applications of the stronger condition <em>cocartesian equipment</em>, and \"why and how\" the weaker condition \"symmetric monoidal\" is not sufficient/<em>not nice</em> for that purpose of <em>that</em> real world application?</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>",

It‚Äôs much likelier to find yourself using objects of some equipment, like sets and relations, to model something in the world. You could also, similarly, imagine using an equipment as a flavor of double Lawvere theory whose models might then be systems of interest in the world; at least for implementation in software this has actually seemed like a bad idea, but <em>finite product double theories</em> have <em>some</em> of the restrictions required of an equipment, namely those along structure maps of products, and there are examples of those that get you kinds of models, such as Cartesian multicategories, you can‚Äôt get with plain Cartesian double theories. Cartesian multicategories are the natural semantics of nonlinear type theories, ie the type theories used implicitly or explicitly by all ordinary programming languages, so that‚Äôs one point of connection with an arguably ‚Äúreal‚Äù part of the world <span aria-label=\"smiling face\" class=\"emoji emoji-263a\" role=\"img\" title=\"smiling face\">:smiling_face:</span></p>",
