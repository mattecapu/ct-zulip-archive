If your “territory” has a certain symmetry, wanting your “maps” to have that symmetry will usually make them worse, not better. Like cardinal directions may have no bearing on the territory but you sure want “up” to be “north” in your map. Or in a more mathematical example, “all vectors are the same” in a vector space -- there's no preferred directions -- but you certainly don't want coordinate systems to have the same property.<br>\nThis is not to say it can't be done, just that I don't think it brings any advantage and gives you a less flexible tool (for example, you may not be able to relate compact closed stuff to non-compact closed stuff)...</p>",
