I've seen many more problems in physics and engineering than I have in math, and I sometimes have a hard time mapping the formal mathematical definition of something into something I'm more familiar with. For example, physicists often study 1-dimensional systems that are really simplifications of 3 (or more)-dimensional systems, so the idea that collapsing along a dimension might be a functor is particularly meaningful to me. Similarly, a physicist might look at the same phenomena at different scales, and the idea that phase transitions/renormalization/fractals might be connected to functors is also interesting.</p>",
