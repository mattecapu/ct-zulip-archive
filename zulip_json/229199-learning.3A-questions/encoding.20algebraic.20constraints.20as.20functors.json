Is there a way to translate this into a functor from some index category into Set? </p>\n<p>In my example,  I start by defining the category of free monoids with 3 generators by taking an index category that has three freely composing non-identity arrows, and taking all functors from this category into Set. However, I want to get a sub-category of this, which has a few additional constrains. For example,  if we call the endofunctions f, g, and h, I want to say that if an element is fixed under f and g i.e., if f(x) = g(x) = x , then h(x) must be a special element p. In addition, I want to say that there are three distinct special elements {a,b,c} in the monoid's underlying set, which are such that for all elements x, h(x) is not an element of {a,b,c}. </p>\n<p>I know there is probably some super general/abstract way to do this in general using Yoneda's lemma and such, but I'm wondering if there is a more concrete way to think about this for simple definitions like the example I gave.</p>",
