The people at the top of our field do not, as a rule, issue problems or programs of conjectures that shape our subject for years to come. In fact, in many cases, they simply announce results with only an outline of proof – and never generate a complete proof. Then, when others work to develop proofs, they are not said to have solved a problem of So-and-So; rather, they have completed the write-up of So-and-So’s proof or given a new proof of So-and-So’s theorem. The ossification of a caste system – in which one group has the general ideas and vision while another toils to realize that vision – is no way for the subject to flourish. Other subjects have high-status visionaries  who are no sketchier in details than those in homotopy theory, but whose unproved insights are nevertheless known as conjectures, problems, and programs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(that's what I had in the back of my mind when writing the above comment)</p>",
