If we have some category of categories (like Cat or a subcategory thereof) C and some category Z, it seems like that we can make a category [-, Z] whose</p>\n<ul>\n<li>objects tuples (A, F), where A is a category in C and  F is a functor A -&gt; Z</li>\n<li>morphisms between (A, F) -&gt; (A', F') consist of a functor phi: A -&gt; A' and a natural transformation alpha: F =&gt; (phi; F')</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the natural transformations are the identity, this looks like an over category Cat/Z. Would this be the over 2-category Cat/Z?</p>\n<p>Thanks!<br>\nPim</p>",
