I would argue that in some ways, Book HoTT is better for gaining intuitions than cubical type theory, because in cubical type theory you have to worry about this additional weird \"interval\" thing that is kind of a type and kind of not a type.  So I would recommend a proof assistant for Book HoTT, such as the <a href=\"https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT/\">HoTT Coq library</a> or one of the Agda HoTT libraries, at least as much as cubical agda to a newcomer.

His book also points to limitations in modal logic and future work along those lines.</p>\n<p>As a software engineer I am particularly interested in the computational power HoTT as it brings the promise to be able to take proofs on simple models and have them translated nearly automatically to more complex models. Eg. Numers with just the successor function and binary numbers that are much more efficient. The last lectures of the Cubical Hott course look at that.

You will probably get better participation and engagement if your questions are self-contained.  Links and excerpts are good for pointing to supplementary things, but if someone has to click on a link or picture to even know what you're talking about, most of the time most people won't bother, even when they could have helped.</p>\n<p>To use your previous question as an example, compare:<br>\n\"Is there a way I can understand this development better in details? [image]\"<br>\nwith:<br>\n\"In [paper], [author] develops the idea of [idea].  Is there a way I can understand this development better in details? [image]\"</p>\n<p>In the first case there's nothing to indicate whether I might have anything constructive to add until I click the image.  The second case gives context.  Now the image is a convenient reference.  If I know something about the topic, I'm more likely to click on the image in the second case.</p>",
