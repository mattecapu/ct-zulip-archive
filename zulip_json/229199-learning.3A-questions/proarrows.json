Saying it this way is unambiguous, because you can specify the role of the tight morphisms and the role of the loose morphisms.  Trying to specify the role of the \"horizontal\" morphisms requires first fixing a convention as to whether to draw the tight morphisms horizontally and the loose ones vertically or vice versa.  That wouldn't be so much of a problem if there were a universally accepted convention, but there isn't.  I tend to draw the loose morphisms horizontally, partly because it uses less space on the page when composing a large number of them, which I tend to do more frequently than composing a large number of tight morphisms, and also because then the \"loose-globular\" 2-cells are drawn in the same orientation as they would be in the bicategory of loose morphisms.  But Bob Pare and his school use the opposite convention.  However, we can all agree on which morphisms are tight and which are loose (at least, once we agree to use those words).</p>",
