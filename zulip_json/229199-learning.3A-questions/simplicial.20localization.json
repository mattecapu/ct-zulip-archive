E.g. if C is the poset {0 &lt; 1 &lt; 2} and W only contains the identity morphisms in C, then the simplicial localisation L(C,W) is not locally Kan: the hom-simplicial set from 0 to 2 is the 1-simplex Delta^1. However, for any category C, if W consists of all morphisms in C, then the simplicial localisation L(C,W) is locally Kan; that's because it's a simplicial groupoid, and all simplicial groupoids are locally Kan.</p>",

Then, since (oo,1)-categories are modeled by locally Kan simplicial categories (rather than general simplicial categories), I expected the simplicial localizations to be locally Kan. Then the homotopy coherent nerve would be a quasicategory etc.</p>",

It is technically correct and perhaps even helpful to say that (∞, 1)-categories are a generalisation of 1-categories. It is not technically true that (∞, 1)-categories generalise categories with weak equivalences – for one thing, every (∞, 1)-category is equivalent to one obtained by simplicially localising a category with weak equivalences, and for another, the process of simplicial localisation loses information. A better analogy would be with so-called marked simplicial sets. Similarly there are gadgets called \"model (∞, 1)-categories\" that generalise model categories.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(oo,1)-categories are modeled by locally Kan simplicial categories</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>OK, but...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(rather than general simplicial categories)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This statement is too strong. Simplicially enriched categories also model (∞, 1)-categories – they are just less convenient than Kan-enriched categories.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Then the homotopy coherent nerve would be a quasicategory etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you have a general simplicially enriched category you can also get a quasicategory by first fibrantly replacing the hom-spaces.
