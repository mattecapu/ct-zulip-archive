It seems like they should be generating the same strongly saturated class by 2-out-of-3, but for reflections the class of morphisms that gets squashed is naturally cofibrantly generated rather than fibrantly generated so it feels like using generating acyclic cofibrations should generalize better to similar situations.</p>",

For instance, in HoTT a nullification is a modality, whereas a general localization is only a reflective subuniverse.  I don't know if this is anyone's motivation in the case of Rezk completion though.</p>",
