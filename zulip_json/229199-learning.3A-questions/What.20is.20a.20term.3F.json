I remember in the past being very confused because I had no intuition for what a \"term\" in type theory was supposed to be, whereas I had a good idea that a \"set\" was a collection of things. Thinking in terms of the term model gave me that intuition of what \"terms\" should be - so if I abandon it, I run into the same problem of not really knowing what a \"term\" is...</p>",
