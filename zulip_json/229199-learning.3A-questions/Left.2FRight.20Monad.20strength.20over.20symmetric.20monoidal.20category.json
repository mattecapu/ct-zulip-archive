I'm halfway between; some things I find easier with string diagrams, but other things I have to translate back into commutative diagrams to make sense of.  Some people seem to think that string diagrams are always better, but I think different notations can each have their strengths and weaknesses.  And that it's entirely reasonable for individual people to prefer one notation over another.</p>",
