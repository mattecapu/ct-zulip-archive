Homotopy type theory expresses internal logic for the (infinity, 1)-category of infinity-groupoids where, to my understanding, an infinity-groupoid is determined by its (potentially context dependent) terms and terms of its iterated identity types. I am curious about why I cannot find a non-type theoretic definition of infinity-groupoids as an algebraic structure whose operations arise from valid judgements in type theory with only constructor being the identity type. Is type theory with only identity types too weak to capture the notion of an infinity-groupoid in this way?</p>",
