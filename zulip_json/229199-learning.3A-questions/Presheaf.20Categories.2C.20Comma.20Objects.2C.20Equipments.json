        "content": "<p>On the nlab page for <a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/2-category+equipped+with+proarrows#motivation\">proarrow equipments</a>, it states that the reason why some V-Cat need proarrow equipments to fully do category theory within is because they may lack comma objects. Specifically it states that in Cat, \"hom-functors can be recovered by looking at comma categories... in some sense this is what all the above internalizations are secretly doing\" with the \"above internalizations\" referring to concepts like limits, fully faithful morphisms, and pointwise kan extensions. My first question is: how is it that you can recover hom functors and related internalizations in Cat from the comma categories? Is it really as simple as finding the comma category (a/b) for C (with a and b functors from the terminal category picking out the objects a and b in C), or is something else at work?</p>\n<p>Secondly, not all categories V-Cat have all comma objects. However, any category can be \"upgraded\" easily into one with all limits, including comma objects, by taking the Yoneda embedding into the presheaf category. In this case, we can find the 2-category [V-Cat^op, Cat] and the Yoneda embedding y: V-Cat -&gt; [V-Cat^op, Cat]. This does have all comma objects. So why do we need proarrow equipments when we could just do this operation to \"uncover\" the \"hidden\" comma objects of any V-Cat, and then we can do all internalizations with that?</p>",

        "content": "<p>The basic issue is that many aspects of category theory rely on being able to talk about hom-sets, e.g. full faithfulness, the hom-set isomorphism characterisation of adjunctions, etc. In formal category, we therefore need some way to talk about these aspects without being able to \"look inside\" our objects and see that they contain a notion of morphism in them (just like how we don't want to look inside the objects of the category of sets to see that they contain elements).</p>\n<p>For instance, if we want to talk about full faithfulness, we need to represent in some way a collection of morphisms <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"script\">D</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>F</mi><mo lspace=\"0em\" rspace=\"0em\">−</mo><mo separator=\"true\">,</mo><mi>F</mi><mo lspace=\"0em\" rspace=\"0em\">−</mo><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathcal D(F{-}, F{-})</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathcal\" style=\"margin-right:0.02778em;\">D</span><span class=\"mopen\">(</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.13889em;\">F</span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord\">−</span></span><span class=\"mpunct\">,</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.1667em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.13889em;\">F</span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord\">−</span></span><span class=\"mclose\">)</span></span></span></span>. How can we do this?

One obvious candidate is the comma category <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>F</mi><mo>↓</mo><mi>F</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">F \\downarrow F</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8889em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.13889em;\">F</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">↓</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.13889em;\">F</span></span></span></span>. This seems reasonable, because we know, following Lawvere, that many aspects of category theory that rely upon hom-sets can be reformulated in terms of comma categories. However, there is a problem with this approach when we do enriched category theory. The problem is not about the existence of comma objects: rather, it is that comma objects do not suffice to faithfully capture the aspects of enriched category theory that involve hom-objects. Intuitively, this is because comma objects capture structure described by individual morphisms in a category, but individual morphisms in an enriched category (meaning morphisms of the form <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>I</mi><mo>→</mo><mi mathvariant=\"script\">C</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo separator=\"true\">,</mo><mi>y</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">I \\to \\mathcal C(x, y)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.07847em;\">I</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">→</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathcal\" style=\"margin-right:0.05834em;\">C</span><span class=\"mopen\">(</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">x</span><span class=\"mpunct\">,</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.1667em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.03588em;\">y</span><span class=\"mclose\">)</span></span></span></span> in the base of enrichment) do not suffice to capture all of the structure of the hom-objects in general. For instance, it is not true that we can capture enriched full faithfulness using (enriched) comma categories.</p>\n<p>Another candidate for capturing these aspects is the notion of distributor/profunctor, which is the approach taken for proarrow equipments. In contrast to comma objects, it turns out that these do suffice to capture the structure of hom-objects in enriched category theory. (Alternatively, presheaf categories also suffice, essentially because they represent distributors, and this is the approach taken by Yoneda structures.)</p>",
