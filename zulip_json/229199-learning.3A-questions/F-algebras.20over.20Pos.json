For instance, it might be worth examining Vitale's <a href=\"http://www.numdam.org/article/CTGDC_1994__35_4_351_0.pdf\">characterization of categories of algebras for monads over Set</a> and seeing which analogous properties of Pos can be lifted. On the other hand, beware that Pos lacks some of the regularity properties that Set has!</p>",
