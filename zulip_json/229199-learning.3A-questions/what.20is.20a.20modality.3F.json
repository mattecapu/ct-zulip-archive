Each judgment form is a 'mode', and may have somewhat different rules for how the reasoning works in that mode.</p>\n<p>In normal logic, there is only one reasoning mode, about 'truth'.  Then every modal logic adds some choices of other reasoning modes. Maybe we also reason about provability/derivability, or 'is always true' vs. 'is true right now' (the latter being what 'truth' is repurposed as). One step toward this is to have multiple judgment forms like <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Δ</mi><mo separator=\"true\">;</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Γ</mi><mo>⊢</mo><mi>A</mi><mtext> </mtext><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"sans-serif\">t</mi><mi mathvariant=\"sans-serif\">r</mi><mi mathvariant=\"sans-serif\">u</mi><mi mathvariant=\"sans-serif\">e</mi></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">Δ; Γ ⊢ A\\ \\mathsf{true}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8888799999999999em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">Δ</span><span class=\"mpunct\">;</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.16666666666666666em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">Γ</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">⊢</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">A</span><span class=\"mspace\"> </span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathsf\">t</span><span class=\"mord mathsf\" style=\"margin-right:0.01389em;\">r</span><span class=\"mord mathsf\">u</span><span class=\"mord mathsf\">e</span></span></span></span></span> vs. <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Δ</mi><mo>⊢</mo><mi>A</mi><mtext> </mtext><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"sans-serif\">d</mi><mi mathvariant=\"sans-serif\">e</mi><mi mathvariant=\"sans-serif\">r</mi><mi mathvariant=\"sans-serif\">i</mi><mi mathvariant=\"sans-serif\">v</mi></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">Δ ⊢ A\\ \\mathsf{deriv}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.69444em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">Δ</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">⊢</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.69444em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">A</span><span class=\"mspace\"> </span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathsf\">d</span><span class=\"mord mathsf\">e</span><span class=\"mord mathsf\" style=\"margin-right:0.01389em;\">r</span><span class=\"mord mathsf\">i</span><span class=\"mord mathsf\" style=\"margin-right:0.01389em;\">v</span></span></span></span></span>, and have rules for deriving both sorts of judgments. This roughly corresponds to having as many categories (for the semantics) as there are modes.</p>\n<p>However, it might also be desirable to be able to reflect one sort of judgment in terms of another, and this is what modalities do. So, there is a correspondence between, say, <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">A</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">A</span></span></span></span> being judged derivable and <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">□</mi><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\square A</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord amsrm\">□</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">A</span></span></span></span> being judged true. Sometimes this can allow you to make some of the modes redundant. For instance, 'derivability' has essentially the same structure as 'truth', except there are no 'local' premises. So you could get rid of reasoning in 'derivability' mode and just have a rule where <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Δ</mi><mo separator=\"true\">;</mo><mo>⊢</mo><mi>A</mi><mtext> </mtext><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"sans-serif\">t</mi><mi mathvariant=\"sans-serif\">r</mi><mi mathvariant=\"sans-serif\">u</mi><mi mathvariant=\"sans-serif\">e</mi></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">Δ; ⊢ A\\ \\mathsf{true}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8888799999999999em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">Δ</span><span class=\"mpunct\">;</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">⊢</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">A</span><span class=\"mspace\"> </span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathsf\">t</span><span class=\"mord mathsf\" style=\"margin-right:0.01389em;\">r</span><span class=\"mord mathsf\">u</span><span class=\"mord mathsf\">e</span></span></span></span></span> lets you deduce truth of <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">□</mi><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\square A</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord amsrm\">□</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">A</span></span></span></span>, and some rules about how <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">□</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\square</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.675em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord amsrm\">□</span></span></span></span> distributes over connectives and such.

I would say modality isn't like that: it's something people are trying to formalize in different ways, where you can only make progress on formalizing it if you have some intuitive feel for it that you get through examples.   </p>\n<p>Of course you can accept someone else's formalization: I feel sure people have written definitions of \"modality\" - if they haven't I could write one right now! - but then you're trusting that they're on the right track.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a way, this reminds me of the status of the word \"planet\" in astronomy, prior to 2006, when the International Astronomical Union finally agreed on a definition for that term.  Planets have been discussed for thousands of years, and science fiction explored the idea of extrasolar planets that most people would agree are planets, in the context of the story.  Some definitions proposed were deemed too strict (e.g. \"has a moon\" would exclude Mercury and Venus).  The 2006 IAU definition didn't really satisfy everyone, either – Pluto had been considered a planet for about 75 years, and now it suddenly isn't.  I wonder if the current state of the word \"modality\" is the same state of limbo that \"planet\" was in 15 years ago.</p>",

Aristotle developed a modal syllogistic in Book I of his Prior Analytics (chs 8–22), which Theophrastus attempted to improve. There are also passages in Aristotle's work, such as the famous sea-battle argument in De Interpretatione §9, that are now seen as anticipations of the connection of modal logic with potentiality and time. In the Hellenistic period, the logicians Diodorus Cronus, Philo the Dialectician and the Stoic Chrysippus each developed a modal system that accounted for the interdefinability of possibility and necessity, accepted axiom T (see below), and combined elements of modal logic and temporal logic in attempts to solve the notorious Master Argument. The earliest formal system of modal logic was developed by Avicenna, who ultimately developed a theory of \"temporally modal\" syllogistic. Modal logic as a self-aware subject owes much to the writings of the Scholastics, in particular William of Ockham and John Duns Scotus, who reasoned informally in a modal manner, mainly to analyze statements about essence and accident. </p>\n<p>C. I. Lewis founded modern modal logic in a series of scholarly articles beginning in 1912 with \"Implication and the Algebra of Logic\".  Lewis was led to invent modal logic, and specifically strict implication, on the grounds that classical logic grants paradoxes of material implication such as the principle that a falsehood implies any proposition. This work culminated in his 1932 book Symbolic Logic (with C. H. Langford), which introduced the five systems S1 through S5.</p>\n</blockquote>",

From FP programming I came to be  interested in how that fits in CT, so as to help bridge these two areas. But most of the work relating RDF and CT does not look at Contexts (Eg . Braatz's thesis). The 2010 paper <a href=\"https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/270829/\">Context Representation for the Semantic Web</a> that looks at it from an Institution Theory perspective, is an exception. But IT has it's limitations as we have heard here.</p>",

In order to define the sheaf of measures, he starts with the object of \"semireals\" in a presheaf topos, which is very promising, and then he takes some contrived subobject of this and shows it's a sheaf. I have a strong suspicion that what he ends up with should amount to something akin to the sheaf of semireals in the sheaf topos, but he doesn't explore that idea. If I'm right, then that provides a new analytic way to do measure theory by converting statements therein into statements about semireals, which seem to be much simpler to describe (internally).</p>",
