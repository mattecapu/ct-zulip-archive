Could anyone maybe give a rough introduction to what these things are supposed to mean here? Like, maybe some simple examples to keep in mind? I know that, outside the context of working in these fields it's probably kind of difficult to catch someone up that fast, but I do think this stuff is cool, and would like to understand the discourse around it a little bit more.</p>",

Thus, problems were inavoidable as soon as topics were discussed at the interplay between them (e.g. cybernetic models of biological systems). A more fundamental definition of a system was required encompassing the different concepts.</p>\n<p>These definitions have in common that a system consists of elements related to each other [S]. Accordingly, Hall and Fagen proposed a definition of a general system as 'a set of objects together with relationships between the objects and between their attributes' [HF],[MP] in 1956. Their paper was published in the first volume of the Journal General Systems. Ludwig von Bertalanffy, one of the editors of the Journal, uses a similar definition in his famous book General Sytem Theory [vB] in 1968. The formalization of this view of a system as a relation between two or more sets was subject to others, however, as for example Mesarovic and Takahara [MT1],[MT2]. We will follow their approach here, but not without mentioning that a number of other definitions of an abstract system have been proposed (Klir [K1],[K2],[K3],[K4], Lin [L], Polderman and Willems [PW],[Wi], Rosen [R1],[R2], Wymore [W1],[W2], Wang [Wa]). Their basic ideas may correspond to the definition of Mesarovic and Takahara in essence, but their theories on the whole usually differ considerably. A standard definition accepted by the whole systems community seems to be still missing.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php?title=Abstract_Systems_Theory\" title=\"https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php?title=Abstract_Systems_Theory\">https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php?title=Abstract_Systems_Theory</a></p>",
