The only other literature I'm aware of in which the condition is mentioned is Nathanael's <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.11611\">recent</a> work on exponentiable VDC's, so this may be a <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"276092\">@Nathanael Arkor</span> question. Does anybody have any insight on this naming, or shall I try to ask Paré directly?</p>",
