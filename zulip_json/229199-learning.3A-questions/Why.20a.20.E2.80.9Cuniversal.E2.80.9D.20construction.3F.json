Why are we using the word “universal”? It seems like a more precise word would be “unique”, because a universal construction appears to be a unique object identified by its unique property. Were it not for tradition, could we simply be using the terms “unique object”, “unique property”, and “unique morphism” instead?

I hope it's clear to you by this point that \"universal\" means something distinct from \"unique\", in that a universal property doesn't just define it uniquely up to unique isomorphism, but specifies its relationship with <em>all other entities</em> of the same form. I could describe the terminal object in the category of sets uniquely up to unique isomorphism by formally describing the property of a set to have a unique element, but this is not the same as describing its universal property: the same description gives me uniqueness up to unique isomorphism of a 1-element set in the opposite of the category of sets, or in the core (maximal groupoid) of the category of Sets, but a 1-element set is no longer a terminal object in these other categories.</p>",
