Proofs in first-order logic rely only on simple rules for manipulating finite strings of symbols.   They don't require concepts of \"set\" or \"membership\".    We say it's purely syntactic.</p>\n<p>On the other hand there are many important metatheorems - that is, theorems <em>about</em> first-order logic - that are phrased in the language of set theory.  In other words, we can use set theory, either naive or axiomatic, to reason <em>about</em> the syntax of first-order logic.</p>\n<p>Also the concept of 'model' of a set of axioms in first-order logic relies on set theory.    This can be seen as another aspect of metamathematics.   </p>\n<p>The most important metamathematical result about classical first-order logic is the soundness and completeness result saying that a sentence is provable from some axioms iff it is valid - i.e., satisfied in every model of those axioms.   Provability is a purely syntactic notion, while validity is semantic.</p>",

If I'm understanding it correctly, the other identities for Boolean algebras can be derived from this (and the substitution rule for equality). Which, I admit, is an interesting and curious fact, a kind of completeness theorem. Wolfram didn't prove this himself; it is one of 25 candidate equations he identified as possibly being a single axiom for Boolean algebras in terms of NAND, and other people showed it in fact works. See the article <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_axioms_for_Boolean_algebra\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_axioms_for_Boolean_algebra</a>. </p>\n<p>(Is it universally called the \"Wolfram axiom\", outside of Wolfram's MathWorld? I forget what exactly was said in the conversation I was in the other day during my visit to Tallinn, where we were talking about people naming concepts after themselves.)  </p>\n<p>On the other hand, if compelled to refer to him, I would be all too happy to occasionally refer to the Sheffer stroke as the \"Wolfram ego stroke\". :-P</p>",
