In the vast majority of cases, when a constructed category inherits limits and colimits from its inputs, it does so in a constructive \"specified\" way.  The only counterexamples I know of are \"homotopy category\" type constructions where one quotients the \"natural\" morphisms by some equivalence relation, and constructing limits or colimits requires a choice of representatives for some equivalence classes of morphisms.  This is even rarer than it might appear, because the average \"homotopy category\" doesn't even <em>have</em> all limits and colimits, even classically (and those that it does have, like products and coproducts, don't have arrows as inputs and hence don't require choice either).  The only naturally-occurring example I'm aware of where a \"homotopy category\" does have limits and colimits is the one in the Elephant, namely \"exact completion\" constructions.  Not that these aren't important, but one shouldn't overstate the magnitude of the issue (and there are also <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08152\">other ways</a> to think about exact completions).</p>",
