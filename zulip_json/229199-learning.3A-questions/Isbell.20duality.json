I thought of the reference <em>Isbell duality</em> from Michael Bart, John F. Kennison and R. Raphael. For lunear logic, I have found <em>Profunctor seman'ntics in linear logic</em>, which seems to be to computation-oriented. However, I can't know if a paper shows correctly what have been done in these areas since I don't know much of them. It is why I m looking for help.</p>",
