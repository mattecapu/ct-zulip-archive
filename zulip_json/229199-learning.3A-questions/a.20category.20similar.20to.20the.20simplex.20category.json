It's all about putting balls in boxes.</p>\n<p>For the relationship between posets, categories, face complex (simplicial complex) and nerve (simplicial set) (and also fat nerve (simplicial groupoid)), there is Appendix B of [Gálvez-Kock-Tonks, <em>Decomposition spaces in combinatorics</em>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09225]\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09225]</a>. Although there is a risk the paper itself will count as technical, the appendix is supposed to be elementary.</p>\n<p>Regarding the category you ask for, I think it is not easy to get, and maybe it does not exist. If I understand you correctly, the hom set hom(m,n) should be the set of isoclasses of maps m -&gt; n (where an isomorphism between two maps is a pair consisting of an isomorphism between the domains and an isomorphism beteween the codomains), so that hom(3,2) would have 2 elements instead of 8. But then I think there is no longer any well-defined composition law. (If something like this is needed, it might be easier to obtain as a category object internal to groupoids, starting with the fat nerve of the category of finite sets, and modifying it a bit. The fat nerve is defined just as the nerve, but instead of building a simplicial set whose set of n-simplices is the set Fun([n],C), it is a simplicial groupoid whose groupoid of n-simplices is Map([n],C), consisting of functors [n]-&gt;C and their invertible natural transformations.)</p>\n<p>Regarding a category of sequences of arrows, as already mentioned there is the free category on the underlying directed graph. As you observe this does not take into account the category structure. There is a different object which does (and as you suggested it has the sequence of composable arrows as objects instead of as morphisms), namely the category of elements of the nerve of the category. Its objects are the composable sequences, and a morphism between two sequences of length n and m is a map a:n-&gt;m in Delta, such that the length-m sequence composed according to the map a is equal to the length-n sequence. There is an extensive introductory nlab entry on the category of elements.</p>",

The notion of morphism I was searching is precisely that which <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"276625\">@Joachim Kock</span>  explains, sadly I do not know a combinatorics name for it. Maybe it may help also to think, pictorially, a morphism between m and n as the isomorphism class of a depth one forest with m leaves and n roots.<br>\n Anyhow, for my application it is probably better to drop the \"up to isomorphism\", and simply consider morphisms of finite sets:<br>\nI am trying, mostly for fun, to categorify the notion of arrangement, in Spencer-Brown's Laws of Form, after having read a bit of Kauffman's work on it. And the thing is that an arrangement is basically a  (finite) number of nonintersecting closed curves in the plane. Then I thought about the above putative category, where a composable sequence of morphisms should correspond precisely to an arrangement. Dropping the \"up to isomorphism\" should not be much damage. <br>\nThis is also what actually links my two questions. <br>\nThanks again.</p>",
