We know how to write Petri nets in prolog, CQL, etc so it's easy to see how their simulations can be formulated as lifting problems for copresheaves (in fact I remember Statebox doing stuff like this; another reference is \"Simulation of Petri nets in Prolog\" by Palshikar).  But I understand that because of the various decidability properties of Petri nets, they can't be chaotic in the same sense as the weather.  So I'm looking for a dynamical system formalism that 1) can be expressed in prolog/cql/lifting problems etc and 2) admits a chaotic system with undecidable long term behavior that 3) would make for a cool demo.  I've been toying around with encoding the Collatz conjecture, for example; its behavior is chaotic enough that no one can prove it always settles, and easy enough to write just using equations, but I don't usually hear it described as a dynamical system.  Examples like this but more 'natural'/'better to demo' are my real ask.</p>",
