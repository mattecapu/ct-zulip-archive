In low dimensions, the orientals appear to give a single 0-vertex, a 1-morphism, a \"multiplication\" 2-morphism, an associator 3-morphism and a pentagonator 4-morphism. Starting with the pentagonator there is an interchange involved; this is innocuous in a strict setting but becomes important in semi-strict models with weak interchange. I would imagine that the choice of arrangements and interchanges could be contractible, and ideally there would be a functorial \"mechanical\" choice on how to arrange things. Is there any discussion of something like this in the literature somewhere? Since the orientals arise by taking cones iteratively, it would probably also help to understand joins or Gray tensor products in the presence of weak interchange.</p>",
