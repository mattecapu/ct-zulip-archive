You can make this procedure more efficient by using language-equivalence to discard redundant internal states at each composition step.  For well-chosen decompositions (although it is not clear what those are in general), this method seems to reduce the complexity of reachability-checking and has been shown to outperform several existing reachability tools.</p>",

Compositional here means exactly what Robin said: there is a monoidal functor from the \"category of syntax\" (where syntax here is Petri nets) to the \"category of semantics\" (the category of open transition systems). In a way this project was motivated by 90s and 00s Concurrency Theory -- the usual stereotype was that either you do process algebra, where you care about compositionality, or you do Petri nets, where you don't. I wanted to 1) show the Petri net people that compositionality can be useful; not only for model checking but also for other things and 2) show the process algebra people that syntax for concurrency can be more interesting than a Dijkstra parallel composition operator</p>",

Note also that the composition of NFA that we use is quite unusual: much like the composition of nets via transition synchronisation, we compose NFA by synchronising on the shared component of the pairs that make up their respective alphabets.

You see that it's really an extended form of the usual relational composition.</p>\n<p>And, to answer your first question, there are canonical ways of replacing an NFA with a simpler language-equivalent one. Well, that's not entirely true: there is a canonical minimal (i.e. with the smallest number of states up to isomorphism) <em>DFA</em> that recognises a given language. Now, I'm not sure this is what <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"281251\">@Pawel Sobocinski</span> and his coauthors did but that would be one way of discarding useless states. Determinise and then minimise, although that does sound quite prohibitive in terms of complexity. There might be simpler heuristics that give you sufficient improvements.</p>",
