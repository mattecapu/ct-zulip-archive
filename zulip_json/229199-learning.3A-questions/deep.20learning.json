Unfortunately ACT for Deep Learning is a relatively niche field, and I'm not sure if there's any introductory texts focused on understanding CT with examples from Deep learning. <br>\nIf what you're looking for is papers, then you're sort of in luck, because there's a few. I compiled a list a while ago <a href=\"https://github.com/bgavran/Category_Theory_Machine_Learning\">https://github.com/bgavran/Category_Theory_Machine_Learning</a>  but most of these are probably pretty abstract if you're just getting into this. Nonetheless, as Jules says - it's good to read those and see what kind of things people are doing, even if its just getting a taste.</p>\n<p>Interestingly enough, there's been a new paper on arxiv today (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01189\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01189</a>) about learners, and actually we should have our paper on Categorical Foundations of Gradient-Based Learning up on arxiv very very soon :)</p>",

Does that suggest there's an interesting map in the other direction?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you take the definitions exactly as given in Backprop As Functor and Compositional Game Theory then in a completely literal sense you get a functor from learners to games (I wrote the construction in this short tech report: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08666\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08666</a>), and I think not the other way. But in private we've been fiddling with the definitions of both so they are both subsumed under a single definition, since we had a gut feeling that it was a good idea. Mostly this involves making learners look more like games. In particular, almost all of the differences between the 2 papers arise from the fact that they're not talking about the differentiable structure that's in machine learning, they stick to Set (which in turn buys them some more generality to talk about other kinds of learners that don't use differentiation). Once you put the differentiable structure back into Backprop As Functor it <em>really</em> starts to look the same as open games - not that there's an adjunction or even an equivalence, but that they're literally the same category</p>",
