Finding them to be used in interesting ways in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08863\">epistemic modal logic</a> sparked my interest enough to read enough about them to get a reasonable intuition. Then I realized they had been used by David Spivak in his work on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/0904.2012\">Simplicial Databases</a>, and discovered that that was the first thing discussed in Emilie Riehl's book on <a href=\"https://www.math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/elements.pdf\"> Elements of âˆž-Category Theory</a>.<br>\nThat is when I remembered that I had come across them reading HoTT, and that Cubical Sets were playing the same role in Cubical HoTT. <br>\nIs there an introduction to cubical sets that is as approachable as the paper <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/0809.4221\">An elementary illustrated introduction to simplicial sets</a> by Greg Friedman?</p>",
