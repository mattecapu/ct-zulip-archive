There is a <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_type_theory#Key_concepts\">nice table here</a> that compares Homotopy Theory, based on spaces, to Type Theory.  It would be great to get something similar for Polynomial Functors and Type Theory.  Is this possible?  The question is, how can we summarize how polynomial functors are used as a model of Type Theory?</p>",
