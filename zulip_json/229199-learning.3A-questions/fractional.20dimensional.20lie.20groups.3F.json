        "content": "<p>Hi, I'm wondering whether there is a nice concrete meaning we can assign to the phrase \"the (1/2)-dimensional sphere\" (or its rigid symmetries, SO(3/2))</p>\n<p>I ask not because I like fractals but because I learned that there is a sense in which self-avoiding walks on a lattice are like an ising model with spins lying in S^n rather than S^0, in the limit n -&gt; -1.  More precisely, if we take a finite lattice then we can write the partition function of an ising model with spins in S^n as a well-behaved sum over multigraphs in the lattice whose terms relate to the volume of n-dimensional spheres.  Expressing the latter volume in terms of gamma functions, we take an n -&gt; -1 limit and see that all graphs except 2-regular graphs vanish.  But a 2-regular graph embedded in the lattice is just a disjoint union of self-avoiding cycles.  Taking two derivatives to get a 2-point correlator allows us two degree-one vertices, hence a generating function for the number of self avoiding walks organized by length.  This story I read in a lovely book called \"self avoiding walks\". </p>\n<p>To summarize, the partition function of self-avoiding walks appears as \"the limit of the partition function of ising models\".  What I'm curious about is how far rightward we can drag the word \"limit\" in that quoted phrase.  Can we speak of \"the partition function of the limit of ising models\"?  To do so might require us to make sense of spheres of non-integer dimension.</p>\n<p>Perhaps lie groups give an easier start than spheres.  It would be neat if there was a category containing the category of lie groups where the chain \"SO(1) subset SO(2) subset SO(3) subset ...\" has interpolating links.  Or perhaps one can abstract a lie algebra to its numeric shadow: look at all the invariant contractions of deltas and structure tensors --- e.g. trace(id) = dim no longer needs to be integer.</p>",
