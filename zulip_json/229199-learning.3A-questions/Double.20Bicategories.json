Ideally composition of 1-squares would only be weakly associative and unital?</p>\n<p>It seems like <a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/double+bicategory\">double bicategories</a> might be a version of this (at least if we only take edge-symmetric ones). I'll read up on the definition, but I guess I wanted to ask - at a high-level, why are they seemingly a lot harder to define than ordinary (edge-symmetric) double categories?</p>",
