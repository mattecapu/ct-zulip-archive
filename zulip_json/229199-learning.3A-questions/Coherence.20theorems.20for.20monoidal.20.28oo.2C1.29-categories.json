I'm a bit confused as to why the homotopy category is sufficient to get the 2-cell outside of HoTT. I suppose that these \"homotopy category captures all the important info at this level\" theorems aren't very constructive and don't have a crank you can turn in order to get the 2-cell out.</p>",

You don't just want a 2 cell but a 2 cell unique up to contractible choice (if you don't want to truncate anything). This should the case for honest monoidal (oo, 1)-categories, by the operad thing, but it seems very infinitary and thus hard to do in HoTT.
