However, in <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022404989900650\">Flexible limits for 2-categories</a>, the authors state (p. 9) that they do not know what examples of pseudolimits to add to products and powers to get all pseudolimits.</p>\n<p>There appears to be a contradiction here, because products, powers, and pseudo-equalisers are pseudolimits, and Street claims they generate all pseudolimits. What's going on here?</p>\n<p>One possible answer is that what Street calls a \"pseudo-equalizer\" is not really a pseudo-equaliser, but is actually an iso-inserter (see Example 6.16 of <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022404989900650\">Flexible limits for 2-categories</a>), which is not an example of a pseudolimit. If this is the answer, is there an example of a pseudolimit that cannot be built from products, powers, and pseudo-equalisers?</p>",
