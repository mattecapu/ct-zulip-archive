I was wondering if anyone knows of a high level map of \"pseudoadjunctions\" between Cat and various other 2-categories of more structured categories, such that there is a \"free such and so category generated by a given this and that category\" (where this and that may be \"arbitrary\", in which case we're talking about an adjunction out of Cat). I often end up wondering how to equip categories that may already have a certain given form of structure freely with \"missing\" structure, and knowing whether the relevant 2-categorical analogue of an adjunction exists (and how it works) would be very useful</p>",

        "content": "<p>I don't really know of a 'map' for Cat but you can reuse a lot of your knowledge for Set.  Any adjunction that comes from a planar operad has a pseudo version and you can probably tell when a categorical version is that thing, e.g., monoidal categories for monoids.  I'm slightly less 100% on this, but I also think every symmetric operad has symmetric and maybe braided pseudo versions, e.g. commutative monoids -&gt; symmetric monoidal categories, braided monoidal categories.  And this should lift the whole map for the relevant sort of objects, not just the things connecting directly to Set.</p>",
