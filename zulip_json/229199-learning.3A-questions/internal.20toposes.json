In fact it's rather nice to write down an algebraic definition of an internal topos all in terms of internal adjunctions (cartesian closure is a little more tricky, in that it happens in a slice category, IIRC). Then I believe that writing down the same thing in the bicategory of internal cats and anafunctors (need to maybe have a regular category here, or something a little weaker) gives a definition of internal topos that doesn't demand that we've specified actual pullbacks or internal homs. A terminal object and a subobject classifier is likewise only demanded to exist up to isomorphism, though depending on the ambient regular category one is working with (maybe every regular epi to the terminal object splits), one might be able to specify these exactly.</p>\n<p>However, the main point of introducing anafunctors is not to just define internal toposes, it means we can write down logical morphisms between internal toposes that do not necessarily preserve the internal homs or subobject classifier on the nose, only up to isomorphism.</p>\n<p>What would be really cool is if there was some kind  of definition of internal topos that used formal category theory (basically: the 2-category structure on Cat plus extra things like maybe a Yoneda structure).

For example, differential geometers are often dealing with groupoids in some category of smooth spaces - like orbifolds, or Lie groupoids.</p>\n<p>Other times familiar things turn out to be internal categories and this gives you a new outlook on them.   For example, a 2-term chain complex of abelian groups is the same as a category internal to AbGp... and an (n+1)-term chain complex of abelian groups is the same as a strict n-category in AbGp.   This reveals that the theory of chain complexes can be seen as a small branch of higher category theory.</p>",

Morally, a category with a terminal object, or binary products, or such that some object has a representable functor with a left adjoint, or whatever gadgets that are unique up to unique isomorphism, should be the same thing as a category with chosen gadgets, because the choice is essentially unique! The failure of this is more down to the foundations we choose to work in and the definitions we choose to work with than anything deep. In classical foundations where categories have a _set_ of objects we can (ab)use the axiom of choice to work around this flaw. In HoTT where categories have a _classifying space_ of objects we can use the axiom of unique choice. But in a general 1-topos we have neither the axiom of choice nor classifying spaces.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By the way, it is not the case that in any cartesian category we have the axiom of unique choice. It is very easy to find examples of cartesian categories in which unique choice fails --- in particular, I believe that any quasitopos that is not a topos would be a counterexample (e.g. a category of assemblies).</p>",

        "content": "<p>Thanks, a lot of interesting questions have been asked before on this thread. Let me focus on the interplay. </p>\n<p>First, we need to clarify that this interplay is far from being simple. There are various sections of Recoltes et Semailles that intend to answer that. </p>\n<p>There is nevertheless a particular reference that tries to answer it <br>\nUTILISATION DES CATÉGORIES EN GÉOMÉTRIE ALGÉBRIQUE par Jean GIRAUD <a href=\"https://agrothendieck.github.io/divers/GiraudICMscan.pdf\">scan</a> (you can see also Chapter VII. \"Examples tirés de la Géométrie Algébrique\" of Giraud's thesis)</p>\n<p>You can see also <a href=\"https://www.ams.org/publications/journals/notices/201603/rnoti-p256.pdf\">How Grothendieck Simplified\nAlgebraic Geometry</a><br>\n\"Toposes are less popular than schemes or sites in geometry today. Deligne expresses his view with care: “The tool of topos theory permitted the construction of étale cohomology” [10, p. 15]. Yet, once constructed, this cohomology is “so close to classical intuition” that for most purposes one needs only some ordinary topology plus “a little faith/un peu de foi” [9, p. 5]. Grothendieck would “advise the reader nonetheless to learn the topos language which furnishes an extremely convenient unifying principle” [5, p. VII].\"</p>\n<p>And this is the point I would like to emphasize. Instead of the question of how we can use them in algebraic geometry, we should ask what is topos theory trying to unify (as developed by Grothendieck). <br>\n<em>\"Parmi ces thèmes, le plus vaste par sa portée me paraît être celui des topos, qui fournit l’idée d’une synthèse de la géométrie algébrique, de la topologie et de l’arithmétique.\"</em></p>\n<p>Of course, an answer about this interplay would need a lot more detail, even the interplay between sheaves and algebraic geometry is already a very rich one, but nevertheless... you can see, for example, the thesis of Mme M Reynaud or Jouanolou, SGA 7... </p>\n<p>Grothendieck used \"the notion of a topos and a map of topoi, as an ideal means and guide to put geometrical and topological significance into purely algebraic situations.\" Remember how all those theories began. At the beginning (Weil conjectures), what was needed was a language that would eventually unify the methods used with continuous coefficients in discrete ones.</p>\n<p>The fact, for example, that one can associate a topos (and topological invariants) to an arbitrary category was exploited in various directions by him. And also, the fact that topos constitute a 2-category and not an ordinary category (like topological spaces) would open new doors in topology (remember, this was at the beginning of the 60s). </p>\n<p>One can ask, for example, higher category theory is better suited than topos theory in the things algebraic geometers like..? I think this is not the right question to ask. It is enough to try to understand.</p>\n<p><em>\"Ce qui fait la qualité de l’inventivité et de l’imagination du chercheur, c’est la qualité de son attention, à l’écoute de la voix des choses.\"</em></p>\n<p>Sorry if this goes in another direction than simply citing some references. But maybe helps someone in something.</p>",
