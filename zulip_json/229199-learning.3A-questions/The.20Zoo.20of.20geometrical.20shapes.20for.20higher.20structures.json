The category of atoms is, as you say, very \"maximalist\", in terms of being very expressive with the number of shapes it has.

Suppose there was a nice subcategory of the atom category such that every atom can be built up in some \"canonical\" way by pasting together objects of this nice subcategory; I'm not quite sure whether this is the same sort of \"canonical\" as for dense functors, but morally I want something like \"an atom is a pasted-together collection of objects of the nice subcategory\".</p>\n<p>Then, instead of defining a presheaf on the atom category, you could just define it on this nice subcategory, and then \"extend by colimits\" to the full atom category! And again, this wouldn't give you the <em>generic</em> presheaf on the atom category, only one satisfying an appropriate \"segal condition\" - but, I assume you'd <em>already</em> want to restrict to the class of such presheaves anyway, if you want to focus on the diagrammatic sets that model <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>ω</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\omega</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.4306em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.03588em;\">ω</span></span></span></span>-categories.</p>\n<p>I guess my idea is to \"have my cake and eat it too.\" This way, you can get the expressiveness of the atom category in terms of tensor products, joins, suspensions etc, but without needing to supply a huge amount of data from the get-go - instead just specifying it on a nice subcategory, and then extending.</p>",

It doesn't really work for set-based definitions like quasicategories and diagrammatic sets, where there isn't already a notion of \"contractibility\" except for one given by the fillers themselves.  In other words, a model like complete Segal spaces are a localization of a model structure like simplicial <em>spaces</em>, but quasicategories are not the localization of any natural pre-existing model structure on simplicial <em>sets</em>.</p>",

It makes total sense to use them for atlases.  I just meant that when you change from the <em>existence</em> of fillers to the <em>uniqueness</em> of fillers, you need to also change the <em>name</em> of the structure you're talking about from \"Kan complex / quasicategory\" to something like \"Segal object\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Right. The Segal conditions are given by an iso , whereas the horn fillers are given by an effective epi. But, since people call those atlases higher groupoids, it would still be better to use complete Segal spaces since the underlying cat where simplicial objects are being considered is (sometimes) not given only by 0-truncated guys.</p>",

Yes, the Kan fibrations are usually not of height 0. So I guess the solution is, then, to stop calling atlases of n-stacks n-groupoids and just call them internal Kan simplicial objects.</p>",

Having surjections instead of equivalences is similar to failing a higher-dimensional version of the completeness/univalence condition, so what you have is like an n-groupoid but with a whole space of n-morphisms where, say, an isomorphism of n-morphisms isn't the same as an (n+1)-morphism.</p>",
