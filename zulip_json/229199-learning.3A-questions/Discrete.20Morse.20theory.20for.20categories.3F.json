(1) algebraic morse theory \"is\" just gaussian elimination (2) the grobner basis method \"is\" the same idea as gaussian elimination (3) categorifying ring theory (or algebraic geometry) you get something like symmetric monoidal locally presentable categories, and the claim is that this \"same\" algorithm should also categorify.</p>\n<p>Part of me wonders if this is what is going on with the catlab julia library, but i have no idea about that.</p>",
