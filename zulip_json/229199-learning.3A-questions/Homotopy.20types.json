        "content": "<blockquote>\n<p>Did Homotopy types get their name in anticipation of their application to type theory? </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No.   Something called \"the ramified theory of types\" was invented by Bertrand Russell and Albert North Whitehead in their famous 1910-1912 book <em>Principia Mathematica</em>, which was trying to create a logical foundation for mathematics.  To avoid paradoxes they built a rather elaborate theory of different \"types\" of set.  I don't really understand it, so I'll quote a <a href=\"https://mathoverflow.net/a/376731/2893\">MathOverflow answer</a> by Andreas Blass:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As far as I know, the word \"ramified\", in reference to type theory, means that one pays attention not only to the ranks of sets (where sets of rank n have members of rank n−1) but also to the complexity of their definitions. So for example, a set of fairly low rank, like a set of natural numbers, might be defined by a formula that quantifies over sets of high ranks and would be considered to have high \"level\". The comprehension axioms of such a type theory would impose limitations on both the ranks and the levels of the sets involved.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This rather complicated arrangement was introduced in Russell and Whitehead's \"Principia Mathematica\" to enforce predicativity of their type theory. Unfortunately, it proved too restrictive to serve as a foundation of ordinary mathematics, so it was supplemented with an \"axiom of reducibility\", saying that any set of high level is extensionally equal to (i.e., has the same members as) some set of suitably low level. Afterward (around 1920, I think) Chwistek and Ramsey (independently) noticed that the reducibility axiom had the effect of completely annihilating the structure of levels. So the theory can be reformulated by ignoring levels and working with ranks alone. This is now called either \"simple type theory\" or just \"type theory\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The idea of levels resurfaced in Gödel's definition of the constructible universe <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">L</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">L</span></span></span></span>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Eventually this sort of type theory morphed into the quite different type theory used by logicians and later computer scientists - I have no idea how!</p>\n<p>Quite separately, topologists like J. H. C. Whitehead - <em>a completely different guy named Whitehead!</em> - started talking about homotopy types .   For example, in 1949 Mac Lane (yes, that guy) and Whitehead came out with a paper called <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.36.1.41\">On the 3-type of a complex</a>.   In this they classified what we'd now call homotopy 2-types (since they used a dumb numbering system).  Even now people talk a lot about homotopy <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.4306em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">n</span></span></span></span>-types: we say two nice topological spaces have the same homotopy <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.4306em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">n</span></span></span></span>-type if they are homotopy equivalent up to dimension <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.4306em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">n</span></span></span></span>.

        "content": "<p>Actually, now that I think about it, I don't understand why people, both in Spanish and French, resorted to the adjective \"homotopical\" to render \"homotopy (type theory)\".</p>\n<p>English compound nouns of the form \"X Y\" where both X and Y are nouns are rendered in Romance languages as \"Y of X\".  E.g. \"work permit\" becomes \"permit of work\".  Similarly, \"type theory\" = \"theory of types\", \"homotopy type\" = \"type of homotopy\", and also \"homotopy theory\" = \"theory of homotopy\".</p>\n<p>Following the above, \"(homotopy type) theory\" becomes \"theory of types of homotopy\", which, as I mentioned, is the literal translation of \"théorie des types d'homotopie\".  But then \"homotopy (type theory)\" should become \"theory of homotopy of types\", which is the literal translation of \"théorie de l'homotopie des types\".  As far as I know, nobody has ever used this expression in French, but to me it sounds like a very adequate description of the subject, possibly more than both expressions using the adjective \"homotopique\"/\"homotopical\".  I mean, isn't HoTT about seeing types as spaces, and then studying them from the viewpoint of homotopy theory?</p>\n<p>Of course I am not advocating for changing the terminology, it's just curious that the most direct and obvious translation isn't the one that ended up being used.</p>",

IV</em>, Murray and von Neumann define the <em>algebraical type</em> and the <em>spatial type</em> of a ring of operators in a Hilbert space as being, respectively, its isomorphism class with respect to isomorphism of rings and with respect to <em>isometric</em> isomorphism. <br>\nThese are first occurrences and the authors take a lot of care explaining the meaning of both terms, so it suggests that it is an early use of “type” to denote an equivalence class of objects under some notion of isomorphism. Could it have been influenced by the spread of \"homotopy type\"?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, didn’t know those ones but there are <em>order types</em>, too!
