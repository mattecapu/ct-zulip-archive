The notion of morphism act pointwise like in the case of polycategories, which distinguishes them from strict monoidal categories and functors.</p>\n<p>I suspect that this can be formalized in terms of a generalized polycategory arizing from something like the doubly iterated finite list monad, but like I said the literature is rather sparse.</p>",

But this functor doesn't strictly preserve identities on tensors of generating objects, only on the generating objects themselves.</p>\n<p>Maybe I am just missing a subtlety in the definition of a morphism of props. It is not just a strict monoidal functor, but moreover it has to send n fold tensors of generators in the first category to n fold tensors of corresponding generators in the second category.  So a morphism of props can be defined as a function between colours as function between homs in the obvious way.</p>\n<p>So perhaps the appropriate notion of lax <em>normal</em> functor between 2-props should be more like the corresponding notion for polycategories, as opposed to that for monoidal categories, where one doesn't require that the tensors of identities are sent to tensors of identities (because it is not even a well formed thing to ask for in the polycategory case), only that the identies of generating colours are sent to identities of generating colours.</p>",
