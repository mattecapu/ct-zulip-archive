Let's call *-monoidal functors \"applicatives\", +-monoidal functors \"alternatives\", and ⊠-monoidal functors \"alignables\".</p>\n<p>It seems to me that each applicative and alternative induces an alignable in a relatively obvious way, by utilizing the embedding of the coproduct. I believe these extend to functors <code>Applicative -&gt; Alignable</code> and <code>Alternative -&gt; Alignable</code>.</p>\n<p>My question is whether these functors are in fact right adjoints, and therefore admit a notion of the \"free applicative/alternative generated by an alignable\".</p>\n<p>PS: Sorry to not have provided sufficient detail here (I'm planning to come back and flesh this out) but every time I start asking this question I get bogged down in the details and never end up asking it. Figured someone might already have worked all this out and be able to  just point me to the details.</p>",
