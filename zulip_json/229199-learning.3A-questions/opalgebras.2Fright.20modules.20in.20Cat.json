The definition of these things is pretty abstract, though.  What does the (op)algebraic structure on these things look like in Cat?  For one thing, they're functors <em>out</em> of the monad's base category--this already makes them difficult to get a handle on, unlike the small objects that we usually deal with on the algebra side.</p>\n<p>I've heard somewhere they could be identified with free algebras in Cat and that's why people don't talk about them, but I don't see how that works.</p>",
