Is there a way I can understand these concepts and history better? Why is topology is important in geometry? Do people want to take limit on something? Where does that limit come from? Do they all have implications in physical sciences e.g. general relativity, thermodynamics, or are they just pure math? When people say 'algebraic geometry', what kind of geometry are they referring to and how similar or dissimilar it is to Riemanian geometry? Is there any code I can write to understand these better? What are the concrete mathematical objects that one can think of when going through the abstract concepts?</p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/6d2QbjwaI5uSGelV0VAu6V5I/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/21317/6d2QbjwaI5uSGelV0VAu6V5I/image.png\"></a></div>",

General topology is more interested in properties that might fail for spaces considered by 'elementary analysis', like separability or connectedness or compactness. The most spectacular applications of topology arise from algebraic topology though, where one studies algebraic invariants attached to topological spaces. Be careful though, since most invariants actually  depends only on the <a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/homotopy%20type\">[[homotopy type]]</a> of a space, so on something even weaker than topology!</p>",
