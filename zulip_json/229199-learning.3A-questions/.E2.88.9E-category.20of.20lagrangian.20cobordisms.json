Although with simplicial sets, no one seems to have written the actual deformation retract either</li>\n</ul>\n<p>also, my gut feeling tells me that the collar condition could be relaxed up to homotopy, so that we could ignore them entirely, in the same way that transversality can be circumvented, but i haven't found any good literature on the subject: is there any good reference or work on that somewhere?</p>",
