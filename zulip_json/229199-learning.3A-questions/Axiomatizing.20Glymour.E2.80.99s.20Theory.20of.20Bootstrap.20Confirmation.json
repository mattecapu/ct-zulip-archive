        "content": "<p>I'll suggest you not to invest too much energy in learning ZFC. ZFC is useful if you're doing research in set theory or using set theoretic notions like ordinals, cardinals etc... But there is probably no need of ZFC for talking about \"probability, permutations, functions, real numbers\" and \"a set of individuals\".</p>\n<p>Looking at Glymour's paper <a href=\"https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/philosophy/docs/glymour/glymour1980b.pdf\">Bootstraps and probabilities</a>, it seems to me that he is talking about inferences in a kind of first-order or maybe second-order (because he talks about subsets) logic, but these inferences are not either provable or unprovable, but have a probability. Maybe some link with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic\">fuzzy logic</a> or better <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_logic\">probabilistic logic</a>? </p>\n<p>Some comment about the relation between ZFC, first-order logic etc...: First-order logic is based on a naive set theory which is not formalized. On the other hand ZFC is a theory in first-order logic.  There is this annoying circularity: you need an informal use of sets in order to formalize ZFC. In my mind it is a sign of the impossibility of formalizing everything starting from nothing. You need an informal treatment of something at the beginning.</p>",
