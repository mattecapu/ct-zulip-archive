But my own experience has been that the most vocal opponents of alternative foundations have also been set theorists.  \"Working\" mathematicians tend to be more \"passively\" reactionary, since they don't think about foundations much at all, and more open to being convinced otherwise when good arguments are presented.</p>\n<p>As additional evidence, I don't know what the current status of this is, but I know that at least not so very long ago, many set theorists professed to believe that there was a \"fact of the matter\" regarding whether the Continuum Hypothesis is true or false, which seems to me very hard to square with pluralism.</p>",

One interpretation of Cantor's great insight is that you can just pretend that sets like \"the natural numbers\" behave in essentially this familiar manner of nice concrete finite sets, except that they can be in bijection with a proper subset.

The Hilbertian position differs because it depends on a distinction within mathematical language between a <em>finitary</em> sector, whose sentences express contentful propositions, and an <em>ideal</em>, or <em>infinitary</em> sector. Where exactly Hilbert drew the distinction, or where it should be drawn, is a matter of debate. Crucially, though, Hilbert adopted an instrumentalistic attitude towards the ideal sector. The formulae of this language are, or are treated as if they are, uninterpreted, having the syntactic form of sentences to which we can apply formal rules of transformation and inference but no semantics. Nonetheless they are, or can be useful, if the ideal sector conservatively extends the finitary, that is if no proof from finitary premisses to a finitary conclusion which takes a detour through the infinitary language yields a conclusion we could not have reached using finitary means alone, albeit perhaps (herein lies the utility) by a longer, more unwieldy proof. The goal of the Hilbert programme was to provide a finitary proof of this conservative extension result; most, though not all, think this goal was proved impossible by Gödel’s second incompleteness theorem.</p>\n</blockquote>",
