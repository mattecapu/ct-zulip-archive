The speaker suggests that it’s useful to think of arrows into an object X of a Topos as “etale spaces” over X, and identify X itself with the corresponding slice category.</p>\n<p>The slice category is equivalently the category of elements of Hom(-, X). So is this some instance of yoneda?</p>",

Sh(X) is equivalent to the category of etale spaces over X (given an etale space, the sheaf of local sections is the corresponding sheaf; in the other direction we can glue together copies of the opens of X indexed by the elements of a sheaf to get an etale space). The slice over an etale space Z is equivalent to Sh(Z).</p>",
