        "content": "<p>(This is a type B question in <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"275901\">@Jules Hedges</span> 's classification). <br>\nCategories can model distance or (approximate equality), e.g. with (asym)metric spaces as categories enriched over Cost.  But there, still, composition works \"on the nose\".  It seems (to borrow <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"281710\">@Bar Roytman</span> 's language) that category theory is great for clarifying the subtleties of <strong>sameness</strong> but that <strong>sameness</strong> is not the same as <strong>nearness</strong>.  Are there words I should google to see whether and how one can treat (approximate composition) categorically?</p>\n<p>Here are some examples where there seems to be approximate composition --- and still enough structure that it'd be nice and perhaps plausible to say general things about them:<br>\n<strong>A.</strong> The poset map from Integers to Rationals has a left adjoint Floor and a right adjoint Ceil.  Equipping the categories with addition as a monoidal structure, we find that Floor and Ceil are not monoidal.  But, (psychologically, to me), they <strong>almost</strong> are!  The problem is that Floor(0.6) + Floor(0.6) is different from Floor(0.6 + 0.6).<br>\n<strong>B.</strong> In floating point arithmetic, fuzzy-equality is not transitive.  But somehow numerical methods folks reason about floating point anyway!  It seems they do so using refinements of interval arithmetic, and from these abstract usefully compositional properties such as \"backward stability\".<br>\n<strong>C.</strong> Ideal springs compose: stiffnesses add in the parallel direction and softnesses add in the sequential direction.  But the transverse modes along physical springs don't compose like this: new and longer-wavelength vibration modes arise when one puts real springs in sequence.<br>\n<strong>D.</strong> Small + small is usually equal to small.  Is there a nice way to talk about this without having to measure and add actual numeric sizes?  This is very similar to (<strong>A</strong>).  Intuitively, there is an inverse or adjoint that actually is compositional.</p>",

        "content": "<p>On A), note that iirc multiplication is monoidal, so you do have monoidal functors, just not the ones you were looking for.
