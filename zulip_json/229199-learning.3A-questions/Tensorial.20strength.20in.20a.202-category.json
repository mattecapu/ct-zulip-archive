There is a paper called \"Arrows are Strong Monads\" that does something like this for the 2-category Prof, but I'm having a really hard time reconciling the equipment resulting from their definition of strength in Prof with what we have for a strength in Cat. I think it would clarify things a lot if someone knows of a way to formally state the definition of tensorial strength in terms of the equipment of a 2-category (plus whatever else is necessary).</p>",
