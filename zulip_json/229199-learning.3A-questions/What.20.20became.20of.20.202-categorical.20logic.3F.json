Higher logic encompasses this as a special case, but it's really about what <em>specifications</em> you can <em>satisfy</em> with <em>constructions</em> and (the higher part), how you can relate these different constructions.  You already see the beginnings of this, including its inherent favoring of constructive logic, in Martin-Loef Type Theory, which is why it was able to become the basis for Homotopy Type Theory and its offshoots.</p>\n<p>With conventional logic you manipulate constructions with \"tongs\", proving the existence of specified objects in your semantic universe, but the actual objects are never directly manipulated by the logic.  It has the same technical expressive power, but higher logic can capture reasoning involving constructions of objects and their covariance in much more natural and fluent ways.</p>\n<p>While this is more your domain, I feel that the philosophical impacts of the existence of higher logics include that covariance and simulation can reasonably be taken as fundamental to aspects of ontology like object identity and of epistemology like the meaning of knowledge.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Once upon a time, I left this Zulip because I felt that certain viewpoints being expressed in here might bring disrepute to category theorists, and I had reached the end of my own ability to engage constructively on the topic (in fact, I should have left <em>before</em> I reached that point). I still feel this way, but after reading this thread, I felt strongly that I needed to step in with one remark.</p>\n<p>The (both veiled and unveiled) hostility to <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"276777\">@Mike Shulman</span> in this thread is really uncalled for.  I know Mike doesn't need me to defend him. There are so many snide remarks being made in here, and I don't think it will be constructive or helpful for me to refute all of them individually.  And it's worth saying that it is fine to criticise people.  But what I am seeing here is vendetta of the most inappropriate and disreputable kind.</p>\n<p>I will say for the record that (1) I have never ever seen Mike Shulman claim to be the driving force behind 2-dimensional logic, (2) it is not the case that having public learning-notes on the topic constitutes an implicit claim of priority, (3) it is not the case that notes need to be carefully referenced, (4) several people in this thread, including Ivan, have done excellent published work in 2-dimensional logic and it does not appear that they have been thwarted in doing so by Mike's (non-)priority on the topic, and (5) there is no such thing as \"passive income\" coming from wiki pages, and (6) if you are worried about what is on the nLab, please keep in mind that literally nobody who matters is looking at the nLab and that it really is a nothing more than a lab notebook from the 2010s filled with creative speculation from a small community of people who intended no harm.</p>\n<p>I encourage people to take a deep breath, and consider whether it is healthy to invest so much energy into a vendetta against someone who in this case has done, so far as I can tell, no harm at all. I will say for my own part, I'm happy Mike's notes exist, and I'm also happy that all the publications by other authors mentioned in this thread exist. When I do work that involves 2-dimensional logic, I cite the latter because publications are the thing you cite. But I'm also happy to acknowledge my gratitude to Mike for all the effort he has taken to digest and explain the ideas that so many people have worked on, and provide accessible introductions to areas of research that can be difficult to get a handle on.</p>\n<p>I suggest to the moderators that this thread might best be locked. Nobody should have to endure the kind of outrageous accusation of harm that are being allowed to pass here, and perhaps everyone would do well to have a break.</p>\n<p>P.S. I will not be replying further, as my intention is not to spark a debate.</p>",
