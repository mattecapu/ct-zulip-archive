        "content": "<p>Spivak says that an olog’s arrows convey “<em>aspects</em>” of a thing. An issue I have with this is that it is unclear if there is any way to distinguish between an “aspect” of a thing, and any other kind of semantic assertion about that thing. What is not an aspect?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dogs have legs.</li>\n<li>Dogs are mammals.</li>\n<li>Dogs need water.</li>\n<li>Dogs originated in Europe.</li>\n<li>Dogs are domesticated wolves.</li>\n<li>Dogs exist.</li>\n<li>Dogs are not pigeons.</li>\n<li>Dogs are friendly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s consider restricting the arrows of an olog to a single kind of semantic relation, to see if it sheds light on if arrows should be semantically unrestricted (or if there should be different classes of arrows for different kinds of relations).</p>\n<h1>1. Arrows are Subtype Relations</h1>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>dog —&gt;|is| mammal\ndog —&gt;|is| animal\ndog —&gt;|is| thing\ndog —&gt;|is| pet\ndog —&gt;|is| organism\ndog —&gt;|is| species\ndog —&gt;|is| concept\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>And so on. This is the well-known idea that a category is equivalent to a poset.</p>\n<h1>2. Arrows are Properties</h1>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>dog —&gt; friendly\ndog —&gt; furry\ndog —&gt; warm\nfriendly —&gt; nice\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I haven’t figured this one out yet because it seems like it would need to be written entirely in adjectives, so you would need to claim an adjective like yellow has some other property than yellowness. Not sure it makes sense. At that point it might be more like a web of synonyms, instead.</p>\n<h1>3. Arrows are some kind of “possession” or “containment”</h1>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>dog —&gt;|has| legs\ndog —&gt;|has| mouth\ndog —&gt;|has| a set of friends (which could be empty)\ndog —&gt;|has| hopes for future\ndog —&gt;|has| feelings\ndog —&gt;|has| collar\ndog —&gt;|has| ability to run\ndog —&gt;|has| an age\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>All I can say for now is that this one comes closest to the example ologs of Spivak’s I have seen. But semantically, what kind of “has” is this? In linguistics, I believe the most abstract catch-all for all kinds of “having” is called ‘reference’. It simply means, “is associated with”, in some way. Could ologs thus be adequately formulated with all arrows simply labeled as “is associated with”?</p>\n<h1>The takeaway for now.</h1>\n<p>I am pretty sure Spivak’s ologs use <strong>both</strong> arrows-as-subtypes and arrows-as-reference. Do they use any other kinds of arrows?</p>\n<p>We can try any given verb.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>dog —&gt;|need| water\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>If the verb expresses a universal property of the noun class, then it seems that any verb is acceptable in an olog.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>dog —&gt;|run| Hawaii\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>If the verb expresses something about a member of the class, then it does not seem suitable for an olog (so far).</p>\n<p>Philosophically, could we say (for now) that the olog expresses the “necessary and sufficient” conditions of a thing? Which leads to the question: what <em>can’t</em> it therefore express? “Necessary and sufficient conditions” of an abstract Ideal Form are atemporal - it leads to the question, “can ologs talk about non-universal things, like the particularities of a single dog, or an event that happened at some point in historical time? How?”</p>\n<p><strong>This is the next question: can you construct a language of particularities out of a language of universals, or do you need to allow yourself the ability to express particularities a priori, in the language you are using?</strong></p>",

He is proposing a new structure whose aspects he means to cover <em>any robust non-error-prone use</em> of a database whatsoever.  Not by specifying in exacting details what every arrow must mean, but just by requiring you confirm your ologs obeys certain commutative diagrams once you build them.  Like, you deploy the olog cluster, ingest your data from <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"sans-serif\">S</mi><mi mathvariant=\"sans-serif\">e</mi><mi mathvariant=\"sans-serif\">t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathsf{Set}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6944em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathsf\">Set</span></span></span></span></span>, and then your data pipeline engineer writes a bunch of tests, not looking at the data content itself, but just wether it satisfies consistency criteria.</p>\n<p>This is a little confusing because usually we do want our arrows to mean something specific in a given category, but within an olog it looks like they can be different kinds of arrows, or more specifically a union/join type of those different types, if you're familiar with Scala.  So David is hinting at a construction valid in any category meeting certain criteria, which is a common and beautiful thing to find once you start looking.  </p>\n<p>I hope that helps, Julius.</p>",

A quality such as Dog -&gt; Weight works because we can have a function sending each dog to it's weight.

But if you wanted to fully abstract away any type of relation (and so include any example of possession such as with someone possessing multiple things in the target set) or the example of People -&gt;[is a sibling to] People, then you would need to consider binary relations instead of functions. Now, Ologs are categories equipped with a model functor from the category to Set. However, if you want to \"stretch\" the definition of olog, you could instead simply consider a category equipped with a \"model\" functor into Rel, the category of sets and the binary relations between them. Indeed, there is a canonical inclusion Set -&gt; Rel and so any olog modeled in Set is also one modeled in Rel, which you can get by simply composing the olog model functor with the inclusion.<br>\nThe good thing about binary relations is that there's a whole family of different kinds/properties of binary relation (of which functions are one special kind), each of which can be interpreted in different ways. Therefore, you can appreciably narrow down what kind of semantics a certain arrow in your olog can represent simply by analyzing the properties of the relation it is mapped to by the model. In addition, if you want to impose semantic restrictions on all the arrows in your olog, you can tune your model to map morphisms in your olog only to binary relations that have some specific property. For example, any relationship between things resembling the sibling example are specified by symmetric endo-relations. An endo-relation is a binary relation between a set and itself, and a symmetric relation is one such that if element a relates to element b, then element b relates to element a (this makes sense for siblings since if you have a sibling, you must also be your sibling's sibling). Your earlier example about subtype relations, likewise, only make sense with injective functions.</p>",
