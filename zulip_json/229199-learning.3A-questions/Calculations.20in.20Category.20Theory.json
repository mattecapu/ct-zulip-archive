What Joachim is referring to there is the algebraic pattern structure on the simplex category: a factorization system that splits any map into its \"inert\" and \"active\" parts --- these are his \"geometric\" and \"algebraic\" parts respectively. This is because a presheaf on inerts which satisfies the Segal condition is the same thing as a graph --- which Joachim is taking to be a kind of generalized space --- while a presheaf on inerts and actives satisfying the Segal condition is a category because the actives correspond precisely to the generalized composition operations in the essentially algebraic theory of categories. </p>\n<p>In my above story, both of these things are in the positive side of the picture. There is an essentially algebraic theory of categories which presents a simple dependent type theory generated by the judgements that there is a type of objects, that for two objects there is a type of morphisms between them, that for any object there is an identity arrow, for two composable arrows there is a composite, and the laws. </p>\n<p>The difference between the inerts and the actives is reflected in this type theory as follows: the inerts are, roughly speaking, the weakenings: the maps between contexts which reflect forgetting about some of the variables in them. The actives correspond to the substitutions which use all of the variables in the context. I don't know when type theories admit active-inert factorization systems on their categories of contexts, but I think it's an interesting question. </p>\n<p>Anyway, for me the \"geometric part\" is not \"all the underlying bookkeeping\" --- that's what the type theory is for. Rather, the \"geometric part\" (or, I would prefer, the \"spatial\" part, since there's really no metric or measurement involved) concerns spaces of functions, streams, or types. These come with a natural \"topology\", sometimes literally as in the Cantor space of functions $$\\mathbb{N} \\to \\{0, 1\\}$ or equivalently bit-streams; or the Dedekind reals, which are a subset of the space of type families varying over a pair of rationals.</p>",

However, she phrased it specifically as \"do you ever compute anything in category theory <em>and not know in advance what the answer will be</em>?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I would say calculating to see if a (pre)sheaf is representable is close to this. </p>\n<p>I can offer an example of when I had to rewrite a limit of diffeological spaces in a bunch of different ways to the point where the limit manifestly existed as a smooth manifold because I could arrange that a bunch of maps were submersions, and so there was iterative construction of the limit purely via pullbacks of submersions, which do of course exist. Sometimes it really wasn't clear if I could get rid of equalisers in the construction, which are problematic in Mfld.</p>\n<p>In  similar but simpler cases this is working with calculating a set-builder notation expression with generalised elements through various isomorphisms so that one has a simpler expression for a limit, or a more conceptually clear limit.</p>",

However, tools like synquid (<a href=\"https://github.com/nadia-polikarpova/synquid\">https://github.com/nadia-polikarpova/synquid</a>) can automatically infer programs from types for many non trivial examples, with the yoneda type signature analog being an especially easy case.</p>\n<p>This, and other tools like this, make me wonder if it's possible to be precise about when it's okay for mathematicians to leave out calculations.</p>\n<p>In particular, I suspect many standard results in category theory could be automated easily. That seems to be a big point of it is my impression, it's supposed to make theory easy.</p>\n<p>I guess implicit in this is how does this transition from \"making easy results thoughtless\" to \"making truly hard results possible\" happen in a subject like calculus? And could that happen more in category theory?</p>\n<p>I've been bitten enough by \"easy\" problems I'd be fine if that were all category theory helped with.</p>\n<p>A related thought, although not calculational, I think Mac Lane's coherence theorem is truly difficult but then you can dodge it by working with unbiased definitions. So my takeaway was \"hard\" results in category theory might be a clue that that the definitions should be reworked.</p>\n<p>So by analogy I'm expecting \"good\" calculations should be \"easy\" in category theory.
