I was looking for a proof assistant that would save me some time, and I found your paper \"Automating Proofs in Category Theory\" and your chapter \"Nuprl as Logical Framework for Automating Proofs in Category Theory\", which seem to be just the kind of thing that I am looking for.  So I am wondering, is it a good idea to use Nuprl for this kind of thing, or is there another proof assistant out now that would be better for this purpose (MetaPRL, RedPRL, Coq?)  Thanks for any advice you can give,</p>\n<p>Best,<br>\nJoshua</p>\n</blockquote>",
