I was wondering if there are any references on formalizing it in category theory. The concept is not explored in the book by Bartosz, and the papers I've found seem to be dealing with transduscer in the context of automata, which I don't know if translates to the programming concept.</p>\n<div class=\"youtube-video message_inline_image\"><a data-id=\"6mTbuzafcII\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mTbuzafcII\"><img src=\"https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/5743b9b18ed0ccc4c06f83612bf150e200b4f995/68747470733a2f2f692e7974696d672e636f6d2f76692f366d5462757a61666349492f64656661756c742e6a7067\"></a></div>",

I can't find an actual axiomatization in the documentation (e.g. something like Haskell's monad API with its monad laws), but based on <a href=\"https://rakhim.org/summary-of-transducers-a-talk-by-rich-hickey/\">https://rakhim.org/summary-of-transducers-a-talk-by-rich-hickey/</a> it seems like the author noticed that \"map followed by filter followed by fold\" fits the transducer pattern.</p>",
