        "content": "<p>I'm trying to understand why people tell the story of strong monads in the order they usually do - in particular, the relationship between strength and symmetry of the monoidal category setting. Strong monads are of course central to Moggi's computational lambda calculus. The stories I've found all seem to first specialise to a symmetric monoidal category, then introduce strength; is symmetry necessary?</p>\n<p>Actually, it seems that people mostly don't tell the story of strong monads at all. Awodey, Barr &amp; Wells TTT, Milewski, Pierce, Riehl, Fong &amp; Spivak, Schalk &amp; Simmons, Leinster, Perrone, Rydeheard &amp; Burstall, Smith, Bell, all I think do not even mention strong functors or strength (at least not by those names). </p>\n<p>I believe that strong monads are due to Kock (1972), who worked only in a symmetric monoidal setting. Mac Lane defines \"closed\" (p184, 2nd ed) only for <em>symmetric</em> monoidal categories, and a \"strong\" monoidal functor (p258) only in the context of a symmetric monoidal category. I think there is no explicit mention of strong monads.</p>\n<p>Moggi uses only strength with respect to products (obviously symmetric), not to an arbitrary monoidal category. Barr &amp; Wells CT4CS mentions Mulry in passing. But in \"Strong Monads, Algebras and Fixed Points\" (LMS Lecture Notes 171, 1991) Mulry defines strong monads only with respect to product; in \"Monads in Semantics\" (ENTCS 14:275-286, 1998) and \"Notions of Monad Strength\" (EPTCS 129, 2013) he generalizes to strong monads in symmetric monoidal categories.</p>\n<p>Why are all these restricted to <em>symmetric</em> monoidal categories? I don't see why one cannot define the notions of monad, strength, strong functor, and strong monad in monoidal categories more generally (but I confess that I have not worked through the details). Does something go wrong? Does it all work, but for some reason it is not very useful or very interesting?</p>",
