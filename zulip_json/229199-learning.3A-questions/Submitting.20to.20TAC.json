Authors must copy every article submission to the Managing Editor at <a href=\"mailto:tac@mta.ca\" title=\"mailto:tac@mta.ca\">tac@mta.ca</a>. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So do I just need to pick someone in the editor list and write an email to them saying \"Dear editor, I'd like to submit this to TAC\", attach a PDF and cc. <a href=\"mailto:tac@mta.ca\" title=\"mailto:tac@mta.ca\">tac@mta.ca</a>?<br>\nAlso, if I understand correctly the PDF I send can be in any latex format, and formatting it using the TAC class is needed only if the PDF is accepted. Can someone confirm this? Cheers!</p>",
