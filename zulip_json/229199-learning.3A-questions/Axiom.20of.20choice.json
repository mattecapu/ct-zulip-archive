There are many toposes where the axiom of choice fails to hold internally, and these are like categories of sets without choice; we can do topos theory over any base topos by using only meta-theoretic principles valid in that topos. Deligne's completeness theorem is a result which uses reasoning about sites in the category of SetsWithChoice to deduce that all locally coherent toposes have enough points, but this is implicitly a result about \"locally coherent toposes over the topos of SetsWithChoice\", which when relativised to other toposes can fail to hold.</p>",

(Once you fix your foundational theory, there is only one \"category of sets\".)  You'll be able to prove strictly more in the former case, just because ZFC is ZF plus an extra axiom, and adding an extra axiom always means you can prove more.</p>",

For instance, if your foundational theory is ZFC, then using categories of group actions (what set theorists call a \"permutation model\") you can construct a category that is like the category of sets but doesn't satisfy choice.  And if your foundational theory is ZF, then the category of sets and functions in Godel's constructible universe L is like the category of sets but does satisfy choice.</p>",
