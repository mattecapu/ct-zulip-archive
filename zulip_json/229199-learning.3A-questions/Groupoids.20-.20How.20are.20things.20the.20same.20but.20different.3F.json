But I'm a bit confused how things are \"the same\" but \"different\". So I'm going to try and give examples of this, but also I'd like to just chat a bit about groupoids.</p>\n<p>Awhile ago I was trying to understand accordions with category theory. The discussion can be summarized by saying it's useful to model musical concepts with G-Torsors, or \"generalized musical intervals\" in David Lewin's terminology. By thinking of G-Torsors as a translation groupoid - I could imagine musical concepts as objects, and the arrows transforming between them as given by group transformations. These symmetries could then be given a physical interpretation for how the musical objects would be played, via an accordion layout.</p>\n<p>One aspect that bugged me about this, was that an actual accordion had a finite number of buttons, but <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi mathvariant=\"double-struck\">Z</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathbb{Z}^2</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8141em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathbb\">Z</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.8141em;\"><span style=\"top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>-Torsors wanted an infinite number of buttons. Applying a translation to the highest note falls off the edge of the accordion.</p>\n<p>The article \"Groupoids: Unifying Internal and External Symmetry\" illustrated how action groupoids (or transformation groupoids) restricted to a bounded set, allows one to define symmetrical features via automorphisms of the ambient space.</p>\n<p>An infinite grid, its symmetries exist at intersections, and midpoints of lines:<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/pxw1ccSQia74lvKjHraUfQBh/image.png\">Infinite tile grid</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/pxw1ccSQia74lvKjHraUfQBh/image.png\" title=\"Infinite tile grid\"><img data-original-content-type=\"image/png\" data-original-dimensions=\"1239x606\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/21317/pxw1ccSQia74lvKjHraUfQBh/image.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div><p>A finite grid requires groupoids to find more distinct sorts of symmetries:<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/2KzWXN7wwwzqqIcMNUnxk2LH/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/2KzWXN7wwwzqqIcMNUnxk2LH/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img data-original-content-type=\"image/png\" data-original-dimensions=\"991x456\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/21317/2KzWXN7wwwzqqIcMNUnxk2LH/image.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div><p>For example, Its possible to detect the corners of a tiled rectangle, by noticing certain reflections preserve the corner edges.</p>\n<p>This gives me ideas for exploring accordions, but maybe I should switch gears to something more familiar. I also wanted to model chess moves, which incidentally also requires the pieces move on a grid. Moving <em>from</em> and <em>to</em> either the corners, edges, or interior squares corresponds to very different familes of moves, which I would say are roughly indicated by the symmetries indicated on the finite rectangle.</p>\n<p>However if I choose my isomorphisms to be knight moves of the would be groupoid, the knight can travel to any square. It's still a puzzle to ask which paths there are between two points on the board.</p>\n<p>Very similar to this, Baez gave the 16 puzzle as an example of a groupoid, where all the positions of the game correspond to different objects, with moves between states given by isomorphisms. If a game can be won from a given position, it's usually thought of as \"equivalent\" to a winning position. Conway invented the Surreal numbers by carefully identifying positions of similar \"winnability\". So I suspect this groupoid perspective is \"correct\" in that a puzzle that hasn't been finished yet, is \"the same\" as a finished puzzle. This is a bit confusing to me.</p>\n<p>Normally, when I think of something as the same, I think of a sort of congruence. If I know how to play a song on the accordion, and I shift my hands, it's still the same song. I'd even go so far as to suggest a path of transitions between various dance positions determines a dance, which different people can perform in different places by simply changing where they start.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Houghton_Typ_705.35.842_-_Kellom_Tomlinson%2C_passacaille.jpg\">Dancing over diagram</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Houghton_Typ_705.35.842_-_Kellom_Tomlinson%2C_passacaille.jpg\" title=\"Dancing over diagram\"><img src=\"https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/6f8c090288154bf5a215919b974cf171a28e69f8/68747470733a2f2f75706c6f61642e77696b696d656469612e6f72672f77696b6970656469612f636f6d6d6f6e732f342f34362f486f756768746f6e5f5479705f3730352e33352e3834325f2d5f4b656c6c6f6d5f546f6d6c696e736f6e2532435f70617373616361696c6c652e6a7067\"></a></div><p>Regardless, in HoTT, I believe it's still meaningful to provide a solution to a 16 puzzle in an identity type, to show the puzzle is actually solvable. <strong>How should I think about \"equivalance\" in a context where it's important to provide a proof that things are equivalent, like in solutions to the 16 puzzles?</strong></p>\n<p>Context for a second question, I'm used to groups being defined as transformations which preserve certain structures or properties of a set we want to explore. With the classic groups being given by isometries. So interesting stuff doesn't happen until you have a <em>symmetrical</em> figure that maps to itself.</p>\n<p>If we lift our perspective to groupoids, thinking of one specified triangle as having lengths <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo separator=\"true\">,</mo><mn>2</mn><mo separator=\"true\">,</mo><mn>3</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">(1, 2, 3)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mopen\">(</span><span class=\"mord\">1</span><span class=\"mpunct\">,</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.1667em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">2</span><span class=\"mpunct\">,</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.1667em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">3</span><span class=\"mclose\">)</span></span></span></span>, then every isometry on this triangle will give an entire groupoids worth of triangles across the plane. Geometric operations on this triangle, like circumscribing with a circle, in a sense should circumscribe all the triangles at the same time. That is, we have a groupoids worth of circles under the same transformations, given by the previous geometric construction. All triangles with various possible side lengths, are connected components of their own groupoids, in general the groupoids will be contractible; however, the <em>non</em>-contractible groupoids correspond to the symmetrical triangles, baking in potential ambiguities.</p>\n<p>Somehow it feels like there should be more to the story, than a groupoid of non-symmetrical triangles being contractible to a point. I'm assuming \"the rest of the story\" is clarified by generalizing to categories. Maps from the contractible groupoid of one triangle, should be different than maps from the triangle of a different contractible groupoid. But I'm not sure how to go about this.</p>\n<p>So to restate my questions, what's happening that makes groupoids more natural than groups, even though they're equivalent? Why do the skeletons seem to be worse? How can things be \"equal\" but different?</p>\n<p>Secondly, I have some narrative in my head of how Klein organized geometry around his Erlangen program. I think it's mostly right, but now I'm feeling there could be a real, or false but simpler, history that takes this narrative further. Is there a natural sequence of ideas to motivate classifying geometry <em>by groupoids</em> instead of groups - and then somehow <em>by categories</em> instead of groupoids? Assuming I really understand groupoids well, how do they fit into the story around the \"Erlangen program\"?</p>\n<p>In any case, I have a much deeper feeling for how important groupoids are, and in what way they are \"better than\" sets with equality. So I'd appreciate any further discussions or suggestions to take this understanding further.</p>\n<p>(I have this sense, \"in mathematics\", that there is a very well understood arrow \"groupoids → categories\" and a mostly understood arrow \"groupoids → ∞-groupoids/HoTT\", but that it's still an active research program to work out the \"pushout\" of \"∞-categories\" in a really nice way. But right now I'm still trying to sort out those first two arrows).</p>",

Also, because these are groupoids, this would have to be a natural isomorphism.</p>\n<p>In particular, there's only an identity natural transformation from any functor to itself, and at most one natural <em>isomorphism</em> to any other functor. So the functors, or symmetries, form a set of contractible groupoids, or just a set.</p>\n<p>So we have just <em>a category</em> of pointed groupoids. Then the category of pointed connected groupoids is equivalent to the category of groups. To define a functor from pointed connected groupoids to groups, just pick out the automorphisms of the specified object of our groupoid. The groupoid laws require these form a group; such a map is fully faithful by construction and essentially surjective, because any given group <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>G</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">G</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">G</span></span></span></span> is the image of a groupoid <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>B</mi><mi>G</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">BG</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">BG</span></span></span></span>. If I took a bit more time, I bet I could find a proof that doesn't need choice.</p>\n<p>Shulman outlined a proof earlier finding an equivalence between <em>connected groupoids</em> and <em>groups up to conjugation</em>, though I believe his proof requires choice in an essential way. The moral I'm digesting are that groupoids <em>are different</em> than groups, you need to carefully choose what you mean by both, and what you mean by equivalence, to illustrate their equivalence. So \"a group is a one object groupoid\" is a risky definition because it's evil. </p>\n<p>If I got all of that right. I saw some cool stuff trying to find the definition of a pointed category - like <a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/delooping\">[[delooping]]</a>, or the <a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/delooping+hypothesis\">[[delooping hypothesis]]</a>.

But in projective geometry, we get to keep whatever details are captured by projective transformations. The point is, if I define a function from some set, with a specified underlying notion of \"equality\" it's implicit that the function should give \"the same\" answer for \"equal\" inputs, but these notions are relative to the space and problem under consideration.</p>\n<p>A much more low brow version of this process is related to quotient constructions. For any set you can establish an equivalence relation (or a groupoid) by giving it a function, and sorting the elements of the domain by what they map to. In some cases, like when defining fractions, you require functions be \"well defined\" by ensuring they give the same answer when evaluated on data that is \"supposed to be the same\".

Personally, I think the main reason for that is that up until now, they've been using formal systems that basically force you to distinguish equality of types from equivalence of types, despite the univalence axiom.</p>\n<p>Specifically, in Book HoTT and in Cubical Type Theory, while you can make an equivalence of types <em>into</em> an equality of types, the resulting equality only remembers the equivalence you started from up to homotopy.  This is seriously annoying, so people working in those systems tend to stick with equivalences of types and only make them into equalities when they're forced to apply univalence for some specific purpose.</p>\n<p>Improving this situation is one of the motivations behind Higher Observational Type Theory.  This system has what I call \"definitional univalence\": if you make an equivalence into an equality of types, the equality remembers exactly at least the two functions underlying the equivalence, not just up to homotopy.  I hope and conjecture that when using H.O.T.T. it should be more feasible to actually <em>use</em> equalities of types everywhere instead of equivalences, and as this becomes more common, homotopy type theorists will get more comfortable writing \"=\" for equivalences.</p>",

The punchline:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Okay: I've told you what a Galois connection is. But now it's time to explain why they matter. This will take much longer - and be much more fun.</p>\n<p>Galois connections do something really cool: they tell you <em>the best possible way to recover data that can't be recovered</em>.</p>\n<p>More precisely, they tell you <em>the best approximation to reversing a computation that can't be reversed.</em></p>\n<p>Someone hands you the output of some computation, and asks you what the input was. Sometimes there's a unique right answer. But sometimes there's more than one answer, or none! That's when your job gets hard. In fact, impossible!
