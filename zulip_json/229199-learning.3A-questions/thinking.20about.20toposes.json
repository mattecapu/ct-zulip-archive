What does the \"algebra\" here refers to?  When people talk about algebra, do they refer to one of group/ring/field or there can be more? In universal algebra <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_algebra\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_algebra</a>, an \"algebra\" on a given space X is an n-ary operation X. The paper also refer to Erlangen program as \"study a geometry by means of its group of automorphisms\" and gives an example of studying the symmetry of fibre bundles. What's \"algebraic\" about this example? Because I don't see any group/ring/field structure here. Does this example has anything to do with 'base change geometric morphism'? How are the groups in a groupoid usually related to one another?</p>",
