One such <a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/michaelshulman/show/exponentials+in+a+2-category\">explicit proof</a> makes use of the fact that in LCCCs \"pullbacks preserve colimits\" (fourth paragraph of Definition section on <a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/locally+cartesian+closed+category\">nLab page on LCCC</a>.  My problem is, I don't see why that latter 'fact' is the case, and I can't find another source that is more explicit about that.</p>\n<p>I should not that proving that the first diagram in the above proof is actually a pushout is... tedious. The definition of the universal arrow and that it has the right properties is quite a bit of work. Furthermore, it's not even obvious, in the sense that this is real data in that arrow that can be defined incorrectly!</p>",
