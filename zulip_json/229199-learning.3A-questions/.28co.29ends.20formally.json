What is the 'minimal'/'canonical' structure a 2-category needs to get an internal notion of (co)end? Obviously a Yoneda structure suffices since it provides hom-arrows and weighted (co)limits, but this seems to be overkill.</p>",

I suppose if you have a Weber 2-topos then you can define twisted arrow categories, which suffice to define (co)ends, but that's pretty close to a Yoneda structure anyway, and it's also a purely cartesian approach that doesn't work for 2-categories of enriched categories.</p>",
