        "content": "<p>Hi! thank you for the response Dr. Baez and Rogers. I am sorry for the wall text but for additional context, the model is partly a synthesis of your work on the cobordism hypothesis and Dr. Eva Miranda’s ideas in Topological Kleene Field Theory. Initially, I was trying to model the semantics of programming languages using enriched categories — but found that directly modeling the languages themselves (especially dynamically typed ones) was too syntactically dense. Instead, I pivoted to using differential geometry to model the computational behavior through structured manifolds, formed from gluing together pairs of 3D helices. Luckily I happened to figure out an easy way to do this from some unrelated research. They act as geometric logic gates via their chirality and orientation.</p>\n<p>Here's where things get strange. I discovered that a certain group cohomology pattern (specifically for finite abelian groups with torsion constraints) that validates a pattern in Dr. Baez’s predictions about quantum tetrahedra, mirroring the behavior he describes. But in the process, the geometric space that realizes this behavior ends up with a fundamental groupoid whose properties fall outside* (not contradict) Grothendieck’s HH.</p>\n<p>In my category, groupoid morphisms that correspond to chirality and orientation swaps on helices that feed into a category called S-GCM (States of Geometrically Computable Manifold) The contradiction isn’t abstract! It arises naturally when trying to preserve computational invariants like chirality and torsion across flow-based morphisms. The resulting ∞-groupoid is not equivalent to the homotopy type unless you erase precisely the data (chirality,torsion) that makes the winding number computationally meaningful.</p>\n<p>So ironically, while trying to prove Baez right in one direction, the construction breaks the categorical foundation beneath it, like stumbling into a weird Lurie-scale pathology.</p>\n<p>Any guidance on how to formalize this or what language might exist for modeling this type of computationally enriched geometric structure would be deeply appreciated. Right now I am following Brenden Fongs work on decorated cospans. And the current paper has an extension that covers this particular limit case. Again, I don't know what the rules on posting pre-prints are but unfortunately I am afraid it's very dense. I am open to posting it though. The entire ambient category that encloses the computation model is something I call \"Embedded Smooth Manifolds with Enrichments\" (\"ESM+\"). It's defined from scratch using nothing but raw geometric calculus, topology, and group theory.</p>\n<p>No this is not a troll post, I promise.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Hi Dr. Carlson,</p>\n<p>Thank you again. Let me try to clarify the formal structure a bit more.</p>\n<p>First, regarding the gluing operation: originally, I did use a standard diffeomorphism between boundaries. However, it was pointed out by another reader that this model lacked flexibility in the topology. So the gluing now proceeds via a flexible spline-based map that still respects smoothness but allows additional symbolic parameters to persist — notably chirality and join angle.</p>\n<p>Here are the core symbolic definitions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Chirality</strong>: an orientation-reversing structure not preserved under general gluing; it introduces a non-invertibility in the morphism set and creates asymmetry in symbolic flow.</li>\n<li><strong>Join angle</strong>: a real-valued parameter (often discrete in examples) associated with the <em>angle of contact</em> between two boundary interfaces. It distinguishes between \"flat\" and \"twisted\" joins, and it alters the symbolic composition rule.</li>\n<li><strong>Sector</strong>: a subdivided region of a manifold boundary, modeled as a local chart labeled with chirality and join angle — you can think of it as an enriched open set with typing-like structure attached.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The reason helices are essential is that each one possesses an <strong>internal axis of symmetry</strong>, allowing a canonical reference frame for measuring join angle. Without that symmetry, join angle becomes frame-dependent and ambiguous. The helix gives you natural local data that makes symbolic flow configuration tractable and well-defined.</p>\n<p>Now, for the algebraic structure:</p>\n<p>Each helical segment is assigned a symbolic boundary type:</p>\n<p><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>χ</mi><mo
