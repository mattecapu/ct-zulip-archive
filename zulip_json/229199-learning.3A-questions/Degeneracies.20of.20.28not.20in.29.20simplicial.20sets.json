Nonetheless, there seems to be an intuitive notion of when one simplicial set is a \"degenerate version\" of another.  It's surprisingly hard to pin down formally, though, even for 1-skeletal simplicial sets.  Is there some established way to know when a map of simplicial sets is \"pure degeneracy\"?  (Or \"pure face\" for that matter?)</p>",
