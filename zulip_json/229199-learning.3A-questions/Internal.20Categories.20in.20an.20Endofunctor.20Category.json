Comonoids in an endofunctor category are comonads.  I would guess that if you add a monad structure to your comonoids, you still have a category, but you have extra structure.  It would be interesting to know what extra stuff you are endowing the category with if you add monad structure.</p>",

I believe that Spivak is highlighting comonads on Set as being internal Categories in Poly.  This is so because an internal category in a monoidal category is a comonoid in that category.  Furthermore, since the monoidal category in question here is an endofunctor category, these comonoids are comonads on Set.  What I am proposing is that we highlight, instead, objects in Poly that are both comonoids and monoids, so that they are actually both monads and comonads.  I am guessing that these objects are, again, categories, but they have added structure.  I wondering what that extra structure is.  So the equation is twofold:1) am I making sense 2) what is the extra structure as mentioned above.</p>",
