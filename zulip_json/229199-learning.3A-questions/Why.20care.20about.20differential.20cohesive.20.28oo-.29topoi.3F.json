I assume this is related to these cohesive topoi I've heard about, but I haven't taken the time to really learn what they are and why one might care (though I do remember when I was younger hearing about some work about \"cohesion\" letting you pass back and forth between synthetic and \"classical\" topological objects, for applications of Brouwer's fixed point theorem etc... I found that really exciting at the time, and still do!).</p>\n<p>I'm obviously interested in (oo-)topoi, so I hope this doesn't come off the way people can when they ask why they should care about various category theoretic concepts... But earnestly, I'm sure most physicists don't know about differential cohesive oo-topoi, so I'm curious what might make them useful, how one might go about using them, etc. </p>\n<p>I could probably write up some guesses here, or clarify some things I already know, but maybe I'll just listen for a while, since I'm not totally sure if any of my guesses and assumptions are relevant</p>",

Condensed matter physics is evidently about the former and thus immensely difficult to compute on its own terms. Translation, if only approximate, to a weakly-interacting system provides computational benefits.</p>\n<p>String dualities translate between apparently very different systems, e.g., changing dimension, adding gravitation. In <a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/AdS-CFT+in+condensed+matter+physics\">[[AdS-CFT in condensed matter physics]]</a>, physicists are looking to find approximate use of the precise dualities of higher-dimensional theories as in <a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/AdS-CFT+correspondence\">[[AdS-CFT correspondence]]</a>.</p>\n<p>Even in the latter case of considering high-dimensional theories, such as string theory, the treatment is usually done perturbatively (like through a series expansion).
