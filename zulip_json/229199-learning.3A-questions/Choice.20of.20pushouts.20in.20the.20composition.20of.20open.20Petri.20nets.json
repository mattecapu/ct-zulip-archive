Are we making a \"choice of pushout\"  in every such composition? Otherwise, how the composition is well defined here? This point was discussed for constructing tensor products via choices of coproducts (Proof of the <strong>Lemma 14</strong> of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.05415\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.05415</a>), but I could not find any such argument for the case of composition. Am I missing anything here?</p>",
