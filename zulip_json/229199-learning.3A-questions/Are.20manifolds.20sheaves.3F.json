In particular, the category of manifolds and etale maps is a Grothendieck topos, so admits all small limits, small colimits, and is cartesian closed (and locally cartesian closed).  Colimits coincide with colimits in the other categories (e.g., sheaves of sets on manifolds and smooth maps), whereas limits and internal homs are quite different.  The inclusion functor from cartesian spaces and etale maps to cartesian spaces and smooth maps induces a left adjoint functor between the corresponding categories of sheaves of sets.  The image of this functor can be characterized as the category of manifolds and etale maps, sitting inside the much larger category of smooth sets and smooth maps.  Abstractly, this describes what is now called a fractured ∞-topos, a theory developed by Joyal–Moerdijk, Dubuc, Carchedi, Lurie.</p>",
