This is made unnecessarily confusing by the widespread habit of not really making explicit the fact that soundness and completeness are always <em>relative</em> notions, i.e. depend on the class (category) of models one talks about. So one has also to reconstruct this in the categorical treatment.</p>\n<p>There is a subtle point here which I kind of glossed over, concerning the notions of theory, model, and doctrine. Namely note that <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">T</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.13889em;\">T</span></span></span></span>, your theory, can be understood in two ways: it's an instance of a particular logical doctrine, and it can be itself instanced to models. To ground this, think: doctrine = (a certain fragment of) first-order logic, theory = monoids, and models = a specific monoid. Thus a 'theory' can both be seen as <em>a model</em> and as <em>having models</em>. You can start to see how model, theory, and doctrine are really the same concept in increasing dimensionality (<a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/microcosm%20principle\">[[microcosm principle]]</a>).</p>\n<p>Again, there is a tendency in logic to be very informal about these subtleties (in fact these are rather metamathematical points, and heard no one raising them outside of categorical logic or adjacent subjects). Specifically, the notion of doctrine is usually just called 'logic' (think: first-order, classical propositional, geometric, linear, etc.), but people will not be very clear about what exactly a logic is. The tell-tale sign that one is dealing with a doctrine rather than a theory is that a theory will have clear-cut languages, by which I mean not just which connectives are around but also which constants. For a doctrine, it is tacitly understood there is going to be an unspecified set of propositional variables around that however you can't use in the axioms. Remembering the soundness-as-freeness bit from before, one can then realize that this is because a doctrine is in fact defining a (2-)monad on a category of propositional variables, so that any specific instance <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi><mi>X</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">TX</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.07847em;\">TX</span></span></span></span> <em>has</em> propositional variables around, but clearly <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">T</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.13889em;\">T</span></span></span></span> is not exhausted by any given choice (there's reasons not to consider doctrines = (2-)monads though, so take this with a grain of salt).</p>",
