And the “closure” of the arrows means simply that there is just also one arrow that signifies “add eggs and sugar at the same time”.

A lot of categories of interest are so-called categories of processes, where objects are states and morphisms are processes that change the state. Your intuition about composition is not totally accurate. Composing \"add eggs\" with \"add sugar\" gives \"add eggs then add sugar\" which is not the same thing as \"add eggs and sugar at the same time\". Both take you from an empty bowl to a bowl with eggs and sugar, but the processes/morphisms are different.</p>",
