Without a lot of non-trivial examples of categories which \"should\" be elementary toposes (but which aren't, say, Grothendieck <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">∞</mi><mo separator=\"true\">,</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">(\\infty,1)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mopen\">(</span><span class=\"mord\">∞</span><span class=\"mpunct\">,</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.16666666666666666em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">1</span><span class=\"mclose\">)</span></span></span></span>-toposes), it's hard to decide which properties should be manually added to the definition, and which others should be viewed as 1-categorical coincidences which can be allowed to fail at the <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">∞</mi><mo separator=\"true\">,</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">(\\infty,1)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mopen\">(</span><span class=\"mord\">∞</span><span class=\"mpunct\">,</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.16666666666666666em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">1</span><span class=\"mclose\">)</span></span></span></span>-level.</p>",
