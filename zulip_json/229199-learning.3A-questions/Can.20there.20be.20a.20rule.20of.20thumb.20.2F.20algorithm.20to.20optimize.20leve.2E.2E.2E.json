However, of course, more generality is not always better. Once generality passes a certain threshold, things become vague and useless.</p>\n<p>Of course, we could treat this on a case-by-case, topic-by-topic basis. However, I wonder, is there or can there ever be a generalized / systematic approach to decide the optimal level of generality?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I am wondering if there is some way to express, categorically, how for some idea, there could be a chain of hypothetical levels of “generality”, and we could show how one of those levels is “optimal” in a quantifiable way, because it “organizes the most amount of information”.</p>",

I guess it is the whole Lawvere's experience of category theory that led him to a fruitful generalization. In that case I find it very difficult to propose a rule of thumb that would have produced Lawvere's metric space without knowing anything about category theory.</p>\n<p>In other words, I believe fruitful generalization can only happen once we have enough instances that \"look the same\". And CT can provide tools to formalize the situation, but I don't think it can provide those instances out of the blue.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I thought about this a bit before, but I'm not sure if it is possible to entirely remove the context from this kind of problem- that is, what level of generality will be \"optimal\" depends significantly on what would be most useful in some particular situation. For instance, metric spaces are useful with all their axioms because they most resemble our familiar concept of distance in physical space. Removing some of the axioms and \"generalizing\" the idea of a metric space in the process will lead to constructions that someone may not consider as useful, but only because they wouldn't be good models for reasoning about \"distance\" any longer. They may still be useful for an entirely different purpose potentially unrelated to reasoning about distance, in which case they would be the most \"optimal\" generalizations, and ordinary metric spaces would be seen as too restrictive. </p>\n<p>Though I do also agree that there are some cases that are universally too restrictive or too general. Here's what I mean: in category theory, specialization and generalization are given respectively by embedding functors into and out of a certain category (you can decide whether \"embedding\" in this context means the functor is faithful/injective on objects, or is fully faithful). For instance, the category of groups embeds into the category of monoids, and the category of metric spaces embeds into the category of Lawvere metric spaces. So a chain of generality can be given by a chain of categories linked by embedding functors. If you follow the chain down enough, you'll just get an embedding out of a one object category, which can be done into any category and so is maximally \"trivial\". This happens when you demand an object satisfy so many properties that only one object does satisfy all those properties, which can be seen as too restrictive in an objective sense. At the other end of the scale, you can have a category that is so large that \"too many\" other categories embed into it, leading one to the sense that the category does not have a strong \"central identity\" and so the objects themselves are viewed as being more vacuous.</p>",
