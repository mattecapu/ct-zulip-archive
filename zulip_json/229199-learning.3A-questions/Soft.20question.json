The context-switch that naturally happens when one is solving a problem by iteratively going through the little tasks that compose it just hijacks my brain sometimes. These distractions range from checking social media to going through a rabbit-hole of references, to ponder a completely different problem related to a subtask.<br>\nIt can be hard to deal with this, when my brain is in 'ADD-mode' it eats productive time from my day. In my experience, handling it requires some discipline, lots of patience and lots of self-compassion. I learnt that often I guess distracted like so if the task I'm supposed to be doing doesn't have a really clear path and thus 'I get bored' while doing it, looking for the next interesting thing. I also learnt that limiting exposition to distractions can help a lot, so I try to work on a whiteboard/notebook if I want to avoid getting lost in side quests. Finally, I learnt that sometimes it's actually good to get distracted like this since it leads to serendipitous realizations, discoveries or just learning, and in a field like category theory is very hard to learn a completely useless fact.</p>",

To keep from getting drained it seems I need to spend an almost equal amount of time each day doing whatever I want: learning algebraic geometry and other bits of math, helping people work on a problem involving octonions, watching music theory videos, chatting here on Zulip and on Mathstodon, working out at the gym, etc.</p>",

In this case, I'd second what David said: look at <a href=\"http://quiv.er\">quiv.er</a> first before reinventing the wheel, and always scope with care, but generally building tools can be in service to larger goals.  Especially if its what part of your brain already really <em>wants</em> to do.  </p>\n<p>Also: remain flexible, and checkin with awareness of the bigger picture every so often.  Bilbo getting lost and winning a ring in a riddle game with a damp hermit turned out to be the <em>main quest</em>, and all that stuff with Smaug was ultimately trifling in comparison.  More people have used TeX than have read the Art of Computer Programming (and the latter is no joke), and while I personally find Wolfram's pet projects uninteresting, Mathematica has had a <em>huge</em> impact.  From a distance, I think Mike Shulman might be a master at building tools that synergize with (what I guess are) his long term interests.  And I'd wager John Baez's pedagogical \"roaming around looking for fun stuff\" serves a highly synergistic effect as well, even if that wasn't planned!</p>",
