But then you'd have to enforce extra constrains to ensure that you don't gets edges between different levels of the hierarchy. i.e., you have to explicitly disallow an edge from going between an n_edge to a m_edge, where n  â‰  m. It would be nicer to have a structure in which the edge hierarchy emerges naturally.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Thanks. If I'm understanding the Wikipedia page right, globular sets are sub-class of the higher-order graph structure where there can only be higher order edges between \"parallel\" edges. This makes sense for higher-order categories. If you take away those extra equations that constrain the source and target functions, then you'd just have the general idea of a higher-order edge. It is surprising to me that this is not studied outside of category theory. It seems like a natural type of network structure that you might find in lots of different contexts.</p>",
