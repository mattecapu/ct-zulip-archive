        "content": "<p>Seems like I am really late, but I am extremely interested in this discussion, and I have thought a lot about these kinds of things, so here is my take on it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Firstly I believe that <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"276679\">@Jonathan Beardsley</span>'s correspondence table is great, but it troubles me a bit to identify cartesian operads with Lawvere theories. They are indeed equivalent, but a cartesian operad is made of operation that have many outputs and just one input, whereas a Lawvere theory is made of operations with many inputs and many outputs. It so happens that in the cartesian case, operations with many outputs are all made out from operations with just one output, hence the equivalence, but that's specific to the cartesian case. So I think there should be (at least) one other column, in which to put a presentation of operations with many inputs and many outputs. As I just discussed, in the cartesian case, this would be Lawvere theories. For the (symmetric) monoidal case, there is no one way of doing, depending on your choice, you get (symmetric) polycategories, (symmetric) PROperads or (symmetric) PROPs. I don't know about the semi-cartesian case</li>\n<li>Secondly, I believe there should be two more columns for the colored such stuff, I know that it was probably implicit in your original correspondence, but as people tend to be vague about colored vs. not colored, I guess it is nice to say non-colored operads, etc... I believe the colored version of Lawvere theories are multisorted Lawvere theories. Then you have colored PROPs, colored PROperads, and also colored operads, colored symmectric operads...</li>\n<li>\n<p>I want to point out that C-systems/contextual categories can be very (very) wild categorically.

The first is the $T$-operads for a monad $T$ (cf Leinster, Higher operads, higher catetgories), and the second is Lawvere theories with arities (cf Berger-Melliès-Weber). Do you know where these fit in this picture? It looks to me like Lawvere theories with arities are analoguous for the cartesian case, since the condition of preserving the nerve functor says things about generic objects being limits of arities, but I don't know of any notion of \"dependent cartesian operad\". As for $T$-operads, they seem way more general, and at least the monoidal and symmetric monoidal cases are included as special cases, but I don't have any more on that. If you have ideas on these questions, I'd be very interested</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

Also the single-sorted cases connect more directly with the logical aspect of it : monoids, groups, abelian groups... all are single-sorted theories. I think that's why the single-sorted case is so much cited. But it's also \"nothing special\" and maybe focusing too much of it hides a bit what's really going on. Along the same lines, I remember really understanding the tensor product of vector spaces only when I realised that it was a special case of a tensor product on bimodules!</p>",
