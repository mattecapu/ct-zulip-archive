If so, how? For context, I'm currently an undergraduate student, and I have never published a paper before, so I don't really know how that works.</p>",

The usual thing is to say something like \"Schopp's bunched type theory\" instead of \"bunched type theory of [Sch06]\".</li>\n<li>Personally I find an unexplained string of symbols like <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">B</mi><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">T</mi></mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo separator=\"true\">,</mo><mo>∗</mo><mo separator=\"true\">,</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Σ</mi><mo separator=\"true\">,</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Π</mi><mo separator=\"true\">,</mo><msup><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Π</mi><mo>∗</mo></msup><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathbf{BT}(1,\\ast,\\Sigma,\\Pi,\\Pi^\\ast)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathbf\">BT</span></span><span class=\"mopen\">(</span><span class=\"mord\">1</span><span class=\"mpunct\">,</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.1667em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">∗</span><span class=\"mpunct\">,</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.1667em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">Σ</span><span class=\"mpunct\">,</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.1667em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">Π</span><span class=\"mpunct\">,</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.1667em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord\">Π</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.6887em;\"><span style=\"top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mbin mtight\">∗</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"mclose\">)</span></span></span></span> to be sufficiently scary that I would never put it into an abstract - nor would I read a paper whose abstract contained that.  In the abstract I would prefer a brief explanation in words.  I'm not a type theorist; they seem to like symbols a lot more than I do!   However, consider the possibility that your current abstract (and first paragraph) doesn't convey much information to people who haven't already read Schopp's work.</li>\n<li>Put your paper on the arXiv first; you can get someone to endorse you.</li>\n<li>Read the journal(s) you hope to publish your paper in, and try to make your paper look similar to those in every way - even tiny ways that may seem irrelevant to you.</li>\n<li>For other tips on how to make your paper interesting, read <a href=\"https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/boring.pdf\">Why mathematics is boring</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Good luck!</p>",
