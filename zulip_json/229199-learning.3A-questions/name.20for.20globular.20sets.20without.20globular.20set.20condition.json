Is there a standard name for a functor from the diagram above into Set <strong><em>without</em></strong> the globular set conditions? I ask because this seems like a natural generalization of a graph with higher order edges and it is surprising to me that there doesn't seem to be a name for it. It is difficult to talk about it as \"the category of globular sets without the globular set condition\". Intuitively, I would call such structures higher-order graphs or higher-order networks, but these terms are not standard. </p>\n<p>I've looked into the terms polygraph and computad because these seem similar, but I still am not sure if either of these is a correct term. Polygraphs (at least in some formulations) appear to include the globular set condition. I can't entirely understand the definition of <a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/computad\">computads</a> on nlab, but it seems like they are related.</p>\n<p>[Update]<br>\nAfter the exchange with <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"276092\">@Nathanael Arkor</span>  below, I've confirmed that what I'm looking for is not a polygraph/computad, since these include a globularity condition.</p>",
