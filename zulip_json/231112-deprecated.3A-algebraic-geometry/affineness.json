        "content": "<p>I have an algebraic intuition to offer, about affineness and affinization.</p>\n<p>The construction of an affine scheme out of a ring is actually the solution to an algebraic problem: Given a ring R, is there an initial local ring L that R maps to? (categorically: are local rings a reflective subcategory of rings?) The answer is no: Suppose e.g. that there was such an initial local ring L for the integers Z. From Z we can map to the local ring Z_(2). In Z_(2) the element 2 is not invertible, so 2 can not be invertible in L in order to have a factorization Z--&gt;L--&gt;Z_(2). The same argument applies to all other primes, so actually we can't invert anything in the passage Z--&gt;L. But without inverting something it's impossible to get a local ring.</p>\n<p>However, there is a _set_ of jointly initial local rings: Any map from Z to a local ring factors through one of the Z_(p). We can use this to solve a relaxed version of our algebraic problem.<br>\n[I don't know if you know  that a sheaf on a topological space can equivalently be defined as a local homeomorphism to the space. In this picture the stalks of the sheaf are the fibers of that local homemorphism. Anyway, that is true, and good mental image for the following story, but not necessary to read it.]</p>\n<p>We can see our given ring as a sheaf of rings on the one point space. Now there _is_ an initial local ring under R, if we allow it to live over a different space than the one point space - that space is Spec(R) and the initial \"local ring\" is the usual structure sheaf on Spec(R): The stalks are local rings (which makes the structure sheaf a local ring from the internal point of view in the category of sheaves). <br>\nIntuitively you give the ring R just enough space to spread out into a collection of local rings, such that these form an initial family -- you have exactly one initial localization for each prime ideal. Looking at maps of ringed spaces in the opposite - i.e. the algebraic - direction, we have a map ({point},R)--&gt;(Spec(R),O_Spec(R)). And you can check that this map is the initial map from R to a local ring, if we see a local ring S as a ringed space ({point},S)<br>\n(it is also the initial map to a local ring in the now generalized sense of local rings \"living over spaces\", and even in the sense of locally ringed toposes)</p>\n<p>So let's see a scheme as a local homemorphism whose fibers are local rings.<br>\nThen \"affine\" means: \"arises as the initial collection of local rings from some ring\". <br>\nAnd affinization is sort of a reversal of our above problem: Above we were given R and asking for the best R--&gt;L, i.e. the closest L to the right of R. Now we are given L and asking for the closest R left of it. More explicitly: Given a collection of local rings, namely the stalks of the structure sheaf of your scheme, find the ring (living over the one point space) that is closest to giving rise to all these local rings by localizations. How do you do this? Well, you take the limit of the diagram consisting of all the stalks and all the partial localizations sitting under them. I.e. you take the limit of the diagram consisting of the values of the structure sheaf on all the opens. But that limit is exactly the ring of global sections, by the sheaf condition. So this is affinization.</p>",
