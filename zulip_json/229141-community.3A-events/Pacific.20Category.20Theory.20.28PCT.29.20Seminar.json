For example, the category of complex vector spaces can be enriched in commutative monoids, or abelian groups, or real vector spaces, or complex vector spaces. In this talk, we explain how, for any locally presentable category C, there is a universal locally presentable monoidal category V in which it can be enriched. The fun part is trying to calculate V for particular choices of C; in general, it is rather intractable but sometimes we get lucky!</p>\n<p>The zoom link will be posted on the website <a href=\"https://pctseminar.github.io/\">https://pctseminar.github.io/</a> shortly before the talk.</p>",

Since its birth,<br>\nseveral equivalent definitions have been proposed. Recently, Leclerc gave<br>\na posetal definition of opetopes, where an opetope is encoded as a poset<br>\nof cells ordered by the subcell relation. This seems to be the most<br>\nelementary and simple definition of opetopes, but there is some<br>\ncomplication related to loops. In this talk, I propose another elementary<br>\ndefinition of opetopes, encoding an opetope as a direct category rather<br>\nthan a poset. Loop issues are resolved by allowing distinct parallel<br>\nmorphisms, and the theory of opetopic sets gets simplified.</p>\n<p>We hope to see you there!</p>",

Arising from the homotopy theory of complexes up to quasi-isomorphism, dg categories admit a natural homotopy theory in their own right, in which the weak equivalences are the quasi-equivalences. In this talk, I present an approach to the homotopy theory of dg categories from the viewpoint of formal category theory. Concretely, I construct a proarrow equipment in the sense of Wood that captures the homotopy theory of dg categories, and study the behavior of homotopy limits in dg categories within this framework.</p>\n<p>We hope to see you there!</p>",
