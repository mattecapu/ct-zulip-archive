Perhaps some other (A)CT enthusiasts will attend? I will be mostly around the Open Research Tools devroom but am keen to hear about any categorical stuff happening in the vicinity. It's probably easier to coordinate on Mastodon (I am at <a href=\"https://mamot.fr/@pintoch\">https://mamot.fr/@pintoch</a>).</p>",
