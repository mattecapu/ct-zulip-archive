Decisions will be communicated shortly after that date, thus in time to register. Priority for speed talk slots will be given to early career researchers and those that need to present in order to receive funding.</p>\n<p>The workshop will bring together researchers in Higher Category Theory, Homotopical Algebra, Categorical Logic, Topos Theory, Homotopy Type Theory, Univalent Foundations, and Model Theory, so as to promote cross-fertilisation between these areas and inspire future developments.</p>\n<p>Invited speakers:</p>\n<p>Steve Awodey (Carnegie Mellon University) <br>\nJulie Bergner (University of Virginia) <br>\nDenis-Charles Cisinski (University of Regensburg) <br>\nIvan Di Liberti (University of Gothenburg) <br>\nEric Finster (University of Birmingham) <br>\nJonas Frey (Université Sorbonne Paris Nord) <br>\nNick Gurski (Case Western Reserve University) <br>\nSimon Henry (University of Ottawa) - TBC<br>\nMark Kamsma (Masaryk University) <br>\nMike Lieberman (Brno University of Technology) <br>\nIeke Moerdijk (University of Utrecht) <br>\nLyne Moser (University of Regensburg) <br>\nMartina Rovelli (University of Massachusetts Amherst) <br>\nChristina Vasilakopoulou (National Technical University of Athens) <br>\nPaula Verdugo (Max Planck Institute for Mathematics) <br>\nJoshua Wrigley (Queen Mary University of London)</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://gtendas.github.io/clhc/\">https://gtendas.github.io/clhc/</a> for more details.</p>\n<p>The workshop is generously supported by the Dame Kathleen Ollerenshaw Trust.</p>\n<p>With best regards,<br>\nNicola Gambino and Giacomo Tendas</p>",
