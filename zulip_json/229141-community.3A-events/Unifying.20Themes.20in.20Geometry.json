More specifically, it will focus on intra-disciplinary connections between algebraic, arithmetic, tropical, motivic, p-adic, adelic, anabelian, topos-theoretic and model-theoretic geometries.<br>\nThe school will feature lecture courses on different aspects of geometry as well as invited talks by top experts in central areas of contemporary mathematics.<br>\nIt is our hope that this event will contribute to stimulate new developments towards a unified geometric vision shedding light on some of the most challenging problems in modern mathematics.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Organizers and school lecturers *</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>Olivia Caramello (University of Insubria and IHES)<br>\nIvan Fesenko (University of Nottingham)<br>\nLaurent Lafforgue (Huawei)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Supporting lecturers *</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>Weronika Czerniawska (University of Geneva)<br>\nPaolo Dolce (Universities of Nottingham and Oxford)<br>\nWojciech Porowski (University of Nottingham)<br>\nRiccardo Zanfa (University of Insubria)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Invited speakers *</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>Alain Connes (IHES)<br>\nMisha Gromov (IHES)<br>\nIlia Itenberg (Sorbonne Université - Paris)<br>\nMaxim Kontsevich (IHES)<br>\nKobi Kremnitzer (University of Oxford)<br>\nBarry Mazur (Harvard University)<br>\nGrigory Mikhalkin (University of Geneva)<br>\nAndras Szenes (University of Geneva)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Registration and contact *</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>Registration information is available at the school webpage<br>\n<a href=\"https://utge.lakecomoschool.org/\">https://utge.lakecomoschool.org/</a></p>\n<p>If you have any queries please send them to the e-mail address<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:info@lakecomoschool.org\">info@lakecomoschool.org</a></p>\n<p>===========================================================================<br>\n==============================================</p>",
