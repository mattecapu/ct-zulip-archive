This conference follows previous events at Cambridge (2021), MIT (2020), Oxford (2019) and Leiden (2018).</p>\n<p>HYBRID FORMAT</p>\n<p>The conference will be fully hybrid, that is, it will be possible for both the audience and presenters to participate remotely over Zoom, if preferred.</p>\n<p>REGISTRATION</p>\n<p>We are asking in-person participants to register and pay a nominal registration fee of GBÂ£20 (about US$25) at the following link:<br>\n<a href=\"https://onlineshop.strath.ac.uk/conferences-and-events/science-faculty/computer-and-information-science/5th-international-conference-on-applied-category-theory-act-2022\">https://onlineshop.strath.ac.uk/conferences-and-events/science-faculty/computer-and-information-science/5th-international-conference-on-applied-category-theory-act-2022</a> <br>\nIf the fee is a financial burden for you, please contact us.</p>\n<p>Online attendance will be free, although we ask that you nevertheless register using the above link. This will allow us to keep track of the numbers of participants, send out zoom links, etc.</p>\n<p>The university's covid regulations change unpredictably, and we still don't know what the capacity of the room will be. In the event that we are over-subscribed, we have some side rooms where participants can watch the livestream together while still participating normally in coffee breaks etc. The reason for the registration fee is to give us the option to limit participation if it becomes necessary, and if that happens then places will be first-come-first-served except for accepted speakers.</p>\n<p>FINANCIAL SUPPORT</p>\n<p>We have a budget for financial assistance for participants thanks to our sponsors, for which priority will be given to accepted speakers, PhD students and early career researchers. Please contact the organisers if this would be useful to you, including information about your status, and your estimated costs.</p>\n<p>Financial support application deadline: Friday 10 June 2022 Anywhere on Earth<br>\nFinancial support notification: Monday 13 June 2022</p>\n<p>TRAVEL AND ACCOMMODATION:</p>\n<p>Central Glasgow has many hotels and Airbnbs, but can be busy in the summer months. The conference will be held in the McCance building on the Strathclyde campus:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/86419875\">https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/86419875</a> <br>\nThe nearest hotel is the Premier Inn, about 30 seconds walk away.</p>\n<p>Glasgow is well served by trains in the UK (e.g. London Euston is 4.5 hours away), and can be reached from the European continent via a Eurostar train to London. Note that advance train tickets can be considerably cheaper in the UK. Glasgow has an international airport, and is also quite easily reachable from Edinburgh airport. </p>\n<p>We look forward to welcoming you in Glasgow!</p>\n<p>-- The organisers<br>\nJules Hedges (<a href=\"mailto:jules.hedges@strath.ac.uk\">jules.hedges@strath.ac.uk</a>)<br>\nFredrik Nordvall Forsberg (<a href=\"mailto:fredrik.nordvall-forsberg@strath.ac.uk\">fredrik.nordvall-forsberg@strath.ac.uk</a>)<br>\nJade Master (<a href=\"mailto:jade.master@strath.ac.uk\">jade.master@strath.ac.uk</a>)<br>\nJames Fairbanks (<a href=\"mailto:fairbanksj@ufl.edu\">fairbanksj@ufl.edu</a>)</p>",
