Previous SYCO events have been held in Birmingham, Strathclyde,<br>\nOxford, Chapman, Leicester, Tallinn, and Como.</p>\n<p>We welcome submissions from researchers across computer science, mathematics,<br>\nphysics, philosophy, and beyond, with the aim of fostering friendly discussion,<br>\ndisseminating new ideas, and spreading knowledge between fields.

Submissions is<br>\neasy, with no formatting or page restrictions. The meeting does not have<br>\nproceedings, so work can be submitted even if it has been submitted or published<br>\nelsewhere.
