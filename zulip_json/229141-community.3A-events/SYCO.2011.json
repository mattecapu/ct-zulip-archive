Previous SYCO events have been held in Birmingham, Strathclyde,<br>\nOxford, Chapman, Leicester, Tallinn, and Como.</p>\n<p>We welcome submissions from researchers across computer science, mathematics,<br>\nphysics, philosophy, and beyond, with the aim of fostering friendly discussion,<br>\ndisseminating new ideas, and spreading knowledge between fields. Submission is<br>\nencouraged for both mature research and work in progress, and by both<br>\nestablished academics and junior researchers, including students. Submissions is<br>\neasy, with no formatting or page restrictions. The meeting does not have<br>\nproceedings, so work can be submitted even if it has been submitted or published<br>\nelsewhere.

Meetings will be held sufficiently frequently to avoid a backlog of<br>\ndeferred papers.</p>\n<p>If you have a submission which was deferred from a previous SYCO meeting, it<br>\nwill not automatically be considered for SYCO 11; you still need to submit it<br>\nagain through OpenReview.
