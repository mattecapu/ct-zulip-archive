This relation plays a crucial role in Voevodsky's program of Univalent Foundations, a new approach to foundations of mathematics based on ideas from homotopy theory, such as the Univalence Principle.</p>\n<p>The UniMath library is a large repository of computer-checked mathematics, developed from the univalent viewpoint. It is based on the computer proof assistant Coq.</p>\n<p>In this school, we aim to introduce newcomers to the ideas of Univalent Foundations and mathematics therein, and to the formalization of mathematics in UniMath (<a href=\"https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath\">https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath</a>), a library of Univalent Mathematics based on the Coq proof assistant.</p>\n<p>Format<br>\n=======<br>\nParticipants will receive an introduction to Univalent Foundations and to mathematics in those foundations. In the accompanying problem sessions, they will formalize pieces of univalent mathematics in the UniMath library.</p>\n<p>Prerequisites<br>\n==========<br>\nParticipants should be interested in mathematics and the use of computers for mathematical reasoning. Participants do not need to have prior knowledge of logic, Coq, or Univalent Foundations.</p>\n<p>Application and funding<br>\n=======================<br>\nFor information on how to participate, please visit <a href=\"https://unimath.github.io/cortona2022\">https://unimath.github.io/cortona2022</a>.</p>\n<p>Best regards,<br>\nThe organizers Benedikt Ahrens and Marco Maggesi</p>",
