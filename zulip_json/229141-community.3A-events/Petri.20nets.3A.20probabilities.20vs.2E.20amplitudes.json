This is the first of 3 talks from the UCR gang on Petri nets and category theory.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Title:</strong> Fock space techniques for stochastic physics</li>\n<li><strong>Abstract:</strong> Some ideas from quantum theory are beginning to percolate back to classical probability theory. For example, the master equation for a chemical reaction network — also known as a stochastic Petri net — describes particle interactions in a stochastic rather than quantum way. If we look at this equation from the perspective of quantum theory, this formalism turns out to involve creation and annihilation operators, coherent states and other well-known ideas — but with a few big differences.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The talk will appear live on streaming video here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/KKGeTANWCAs\">https://youtu.be/KKGeTANWCAs</a></p>\n<div class=\"youtube-video message_inline_image\"><a data-id=\"KKGeTANWCAs\" href=\"https://youtu.be/KKGeTANWCAs\"><img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KKGeTANWCAs/default.jpg\"></a></div><p>and also be recorded.</p>",
