Towards the end we will raise some questions, with the intent of determining what is the “correct” object to consider in these contexts, so as to optimize the generalization/applicability trade-off.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tim Van Der Linden<br>\n<strong>Algebras with representable representations</strong></p>\n<p>(Joint work with Xabier García-Martínez, Matsvei Tsishyn and Corentin Vienne)</p>\n<p>Just like group actions are represented by group automorphisms, Lie algebra actions are represented by derivations: up to isomorphism, a split extension of a Lie algebra B by a Lie algebra X corresponds to a Lie algebra morphism B → Der(X) from B to the Lie algebra Der(X) of derivations on X. The aim of this talk is to elaborate on the question, whether the concept of a derivation can be extended to other types of non-associative algebras over a field K, in such a way that these generalised derivations characterise the K-algebra actions. We prove that the answer is no, as soon as the field K is infinite. In fact, we prove a stronger result: already the representability of all abelian actions – which are usually called representations or Beck modules – suffices for this to be true. Thus we characterise the variety of Lie algebras over an infinite field of characteristic different from 2 as the only variety of non-associative algebras which is a non-abelian category with representable representations. This emphasises the unique role played by the Lie algebra of linear endomorphisms gl(V) as a representing object for the representations on a vector space V.</p>\n</blockquote>",

We first introduce a class of 2-monads whose algebras are monoidal categories modelling resource management. We lift these monads to distributors and define a parametric Kleisli bicategory, giving a sufficient condition for its cartesian closure. In this framework we define a proof-relevant semantics: the interpretation of a term associates to it the set of its typing derivations in appropriate systems. We prove that our model characterize solvability, adapting reducibility techniques to our setting. We conclude by describing wo examples of our construction.</p>\n</blockquote>",
