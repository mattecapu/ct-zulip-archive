Join us tomorrow 9PM UK time in Clubhouse for a chat about Category Theory - what is it, where it's headed and learn how it helps us facilitate communication between scientific fields. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/coecke\">@coecke</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HyperboIeva\">@HyperboIeva</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jbrucj\">@jbrucj</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/H63c6ottLL\">https://twitter.com/jbrucj/status/1365014300881002509</a></p><span>- Bruno Gavranović (@bgavran3)</span></div></div><p>We're going to be talking about what it is, where it's used and really  try to bring it closer to many people who are interested. <br>\nWe're really doing this because we had an impromptu room about a week ago titled \"Category theory\" and actually got quite a few people there who were interested, or sort of knew what it was, but couldn't \"get into it\" and it seemed really helpful to be answering questions and, honestly, just having a chat as opposed to typing the answers out like we do most of the time.</p>\n<p>For those of you that don't know, Clubhouse is like an \"interactive podcast\" audio-only app where people can have conversations about anything in a pretty straightforward way. The only requirement at the moment is that you have an iPhone/iPad, since the app is only available there</p>",

If you want to organize chat-only meetings and record them, you can just use another platform (e.g. a public zoom invite with cam disabled).</p>",

If you wanted a tablet you can write on, but were put off by the price of an iPad, I'd certainly recommend having a look. If you are just using it to write notes/think about maths/Zoom/record lectures, and not actually doing any fancy professional video and sound editing, it will do the job just fine. I strongly recommend the LectureNotes app if you have an Android tablet with a pen, btw.</p>",
