In this talk, we<br>\nwill define the spiral spectral sequence (which recovers the classical<br>\nBousfield-Friedlander spectral sequence from the E^{2} page on) in an<br>\narbitrary simplicial model category and describe the differentials in<br>\nterms of higher homotopy operations. We will also explain how to<br>\nrepresent elements in the filtration of the spiral spectral sequence<br>\nas higher homotopy operations. Finally, we will sketch how one can<br>\ndefine analogous higher homotopy operations in quasi-categories and<br>\nsimplicially enriched categories. .</p>\n<p>Zoom Meeting Information.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://us02web.zoom.us/j/86383090855?pwd=ZGxZd1dnV1MySjg5MjRUY1k1bkFQQT09\" title=\"https://us02web.zoom.us/j/86383090855?pwd=ZGxZd1dnV1MySjg5MjRUY1k1bkFQQT09\">https://us02web.zoom.us/j/86383090855?pwd=ZGxZd1dnV1MySjg5MjRUY1k1bkFQQT09</a></p>\n<p>Meeting ID: 863 8309 0855<br>\nPassword: 066446</p>",
