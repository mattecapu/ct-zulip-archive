This talk aims to study natural extensions where 1/ We may have infinitely many cards in a deck, 2/ We may take the result of a previous shuffle as one of our decks of cards (i.e. shuffles are hierarchical), and 3/ There may even be an infinite number of decks of cards.</p>\n<p>Far from being 'generalisation for generalisation's sake', the original motivation came from theoretical &amp; practical computer science. The mathematics of card shuffles is commonly used to describe processing in multi-threaded computations. Moving to the infinite case gives a language in which one may talk about potentially non-terminating processes, or servers with an unbounded number of clients, etc.</p>\n<p>However, this talk is entirely about algebra &amp; category theory -- just as in the finite case, the mathematics is of interest in its own right, and should be studied as such.</p>\n<p>We model shuffles using operads. The intuition behind them of allowing for arbitrary n-ary operations that compose in a hierarchical manner makes them a natural, inevitable choice for describing such processes such as merging multiple packs of cards.</p>\n<p>We use very concrete examples, based on endomorphism operads in groupoids of arithmetic operations. The resulting structures are at the same time both simple (i.e. elementary arithmetic operations), and related to deep structures in mathematics and category theory (topologies, tensors, coherence, associahedra, etc.)</p>\n<p>We treat this as a feature, not a bug, and use it to describe complex structures in elementary terms. We also aim to give previously unobserved connections between distinct areas of mathematics.</p>",
