EthCC, the crypto conference, is now taking place in Paris as well. So we decided to do a little event on the 21st to let the two crowds know each other and discuss on topics that can interest people on both sides (e.g. quantum cryptography, quantum algortihms, etc). If you are in town and interested, just register here: <a href=\"https://20squares.xyz/EthCCQPLRoundtable.html\">https://20squares.xyz/EthCCQPLRoundtable.html</a><br>\nAtm we've got ~35 sign ups, we aim to get to 50-75.</p>",
