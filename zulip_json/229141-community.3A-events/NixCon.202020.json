So packages are compositions of other packages, which gives nice properties for deploying software. See some descriptions for Nix and NixOS here: <a href=\"https://nixos.org/\">https://nixos.org/</a></p>\n<p>Although there are no Haskell talks on the schedule (as of this posting anyway), there is a \"hallway\" option available by way of creating a room in Jitsi and I'd be surprised if you couldn't find interested Nix+Haskell people to interact with. If you have any questions you can contact me on Zulip or email <a href=\"mailto:orgateam@nixcon.org\">orgateam@nixcon.org</a>. <span aria-label=\"heart\" class=\"emoji emoji-2764\" role=\"img\" title=\"heart\">:heart:</span></p>",
