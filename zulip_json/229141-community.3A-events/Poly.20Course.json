        "content": "<p>Hi all,</p>\n<p>Starting next week, Topos Institute will be running a 13-lecture mini-course on polynomial functors and their applications to interacting dynamical systems, decisions, and data. Details are below.</p>\n<p>======= Announcement =======<br>\nPolynomial Functors: A General Theory of Interaction</p>\n<p>Summary: The category of polynomial functors is a fascinating setting, brimming with rich mathematics and tantalizing applications. In this course, we will investigate these polynomials, with emphasis on their applications to dynamical systems, decisions, and data. We aim to strike a balance between a solid theoretical foundation and a breadth of examples.</p>\n<p>This class may be attended in-person at the Topos Institute Berkeley campus or remotely on YouTube; either way, instructions for attendance can be found on the website. The website also contains a full schedule of the material we'll cover.</p>\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://topos.site/poly-course/\">https://topos.site/poly-course/</a></p>\n<p>Dates: Mondays &amp; Thursdays, July 15 to August 26 (13 lectures)</p>\n<p>Time: 4-5pm PDT (post-class discussion 5-5:30pm PDT)</p>\n<p>Instructors: Nelson Niu and David Spivak</p>\n<p>Book: Polynomial Functors: A General Theory of Interaction<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/ToposInstitute/poly/blob/main/Book-Poly.pdf\">https://github.com/ToposInstitute/poly/blob/main/Book-Poly.pdf</a><br>\na work-in-progress!
