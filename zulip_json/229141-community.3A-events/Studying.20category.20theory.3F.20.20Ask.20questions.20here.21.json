But for people outside of academia, it can be a difficult subject to learn. Topos Institute is hosting a panel discussion, moderated by Emily Riehl, to help self-learners get a better handle on how they may begin to learn the subject and to help category theorists understand what they can do to facilitate this process.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you are interested in learning CT, please submit a question to our panel. We probably will not have time to answer technical questions, but questions about intuition, motivation, resources, processes for learning, applications, challenges, culture, philosophy, etc. are more than welcome. To submit a question, please use the form linked <a href=\"https://forms.gle/tiVRzY7jnBxtNAoE8\">here</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>",
