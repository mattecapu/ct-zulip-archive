The first is a tutorial on the subject on Tuesday, Nov 1 from 1:30 — 3:00.  Miles is conducting the tutorial and he’ll give an overview of the fundamental ideas.  The second event is a one-day symposium on Friday November 4, the program runs from 9:00am — 5:00pm.</p>\n<p>Here are links to events with more information, including a registration form to register to attend in person at CUNY Graduate Center or virtually on Zoom (we’ll send a zoom link later).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://itsatcuny.org/calendar/221104/tensornetworks-quantumcomputation\">https://itsatcuny.org/calendar/221104/tensornetworks-quantumcomputation</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://itsatcuny.org/calendar/tutorialtensornetworks/221101\">https://itsatcuny.org/calendar/tutorialtensornetworks/221101</a></p>\n<p>Talks will be recorded and available later on the ITS Youtube channel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@itsatcuny\">https://www.youtube.com/@itsatcuny</a>.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,<br>\nJohn</p>\n</blockquote>",
