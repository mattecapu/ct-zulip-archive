This year, our main topic is discrete and combinatorial homotopy theory, featuring a minicourse on Discrete Homotopy Theory by Chris Kapulkin from the University of Western Ontario and several related research talks, as well as research talks and poster presentations from other areas of applied geometry and topology.</p>\n<p>Registration to participate without a poster presentation is open until November 8th at the website <a href=\"https://9mwgeometrytopology.eventos.cimat.mx/home_9atd&lt;https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/P_EaCANpnDC0Om38uGZbOn?domain=9mwgeometrytopology.eventos.cimat.mx\">https://9mwgeometrytopology.eventos.cimat.mx/home_9atd&lt;https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/P_EaCANpnDC0Om38uGZbOn?domain=9mwgeometrytopology.eventos.cimat.mx</a>&gt;.</p>\n<p>To apply to present a poster, please register at the above website by November 6th and plan to submit your poster (by email to tda@cimat.mx&lt;mailto:<a href=\"mailto:tda@cimat.mx\">tda@cimat.mx</a>&gt;) by November 8th. The poster session will be on November 10th after the mini-course lecture. All submissions from any area of applied geometry and topology are welcome!</p>\n<p>We look forward to seeing you there!</p>\n<p>Yours truly,</p>\n<p>Antonio Rieser<br>\nJesús Rodríguez<br>\n==================================<br>\nCentro de Investigación en Matemáticas<br>\nJalisco S/N<br>\nColonia Valenciana<br>\nCP 36023 Guanajuato, GTO<br>\nMéxico</p>\n</blockquote>",
