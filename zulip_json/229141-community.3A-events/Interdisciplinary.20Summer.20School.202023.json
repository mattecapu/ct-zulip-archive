Here is the announcement, please feel free to share in your networks and relevant mailing lists:</p>\n<p>Interdisciplinary Summer School 2023 in Valencia (Spain) 24-28 July</p>\n<p>This summer… learn about physics, evolutionary biology, computation, philosophy of science, literature and mathematics… enjoy beach parties, art jam sessions, mind-bending debates, local cuisine and nightlife. All of this, and more, in the scenic city of Valencia, situated on the Mediterranean coast of Spain.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://semf.org.es/school2023/\">https://semf.org.es/school2023/</a></p>\n<p>Places are limited, be sure to follow the link above and register to secure your spot early. Participants in the SEMF Summer School travelling to Valencia get access to sponsored accommodation at a reduced price and in an excellent location, minutes away from the School venue, and within walking distance of the beach and the city centre.</p>\n<p>The aim of this event is to gather a group of young researchers, creators and students that engage in a very unique intellectual environment while attending talks and short courses by leading figures. Here is a handful of speakers and topics covered:</p>\n<p>Michael Levin (Tufts University) - Evolution, Basal Cognition and Regenerative Medicine<br>\nDavid Spivak (MIT) - Category Theory Applied to Scientific Interdisciplinarity<br>\nMilena Ivanova (University of Cambridge) - Aesthetics of Science<br>\nStephen Wolfram (Wolfram Research) - Computational 2nd Law of Thermodynamics<br>\nIrida Altman (ETH Zurich) - Literary Aspects of Mathematics</p>\n<p>We encourage participants to attend in person but remote online attendance is also possible, you can choose your modality when registering in the link above.</p>\n<p>We look forward to welcoming you in Valencia or online soon!</p>\n<p>The SEMF team</p>",

This is the first time we have been able to put this together and have an international audience since covid. We are excited to see how the first edition goes. Next year there will be longer notice!</p>",

As the organizer myself and having run some past editions, I can say that both online and in-person participation have those two aspects to a significant degree. I would say you should consider coming in person if you align with the overall values and \"vibe\" of our society SEMF. You can see that from our website:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://semf.org.es/index.html\">https://semf.org.es/index.html</a></p>\n<p>and YouTube Channel:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@SEMF\">https://www.youtube.com/@SEMF</a></p>",
