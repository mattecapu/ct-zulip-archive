The conference is huge, usually well above ten thousand participants. Let's hope they like category theory!</p>\n<p><strong>Title:</strong> Compositionality: The 10x engineer secret sauce<br>\n<strong>Abstract:</strong> Proponents of blockchains argue that compositionality is a key feature. What is compositionality though?  Maybe surprisingly, there is a rich mathematical framework in which the concept can be made precise as a theory of systems. In this workshop, we provide a primer of that theory and we showcase two practical applications based on it: compositionality in game theory (open games) and in formal verification (automata). The workshop is aimed at devs. There are no mathematical prerequisites.</p>",
