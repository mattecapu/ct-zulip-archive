Univalent Foundations are foundations of mathematics based on the homotopical interpretation of type theory.</p>\n<p>The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers interested in all aspects of Homotopy Type Theory/Univalent Foundations: from the study of syntax and semantics of type theory to practical formalization in proof assistants based on univalent type theory.</p>\n<p>The workshop will be held in person with support for remote participation. We encourage online participation for those who do not wish to or cannot travel. Limited funding for student attendance is available, with further details forthcoming.</p>\n<h3>Invited speakers</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Stefania Damato  (Eötvös Loránd University, Hungary)</li>\n<li>Andrew Swan (University of Ljubljana)</li>\n<li>Hugo Moeneclaey (University of Gothenburg and Chalmers University)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Submissions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Abstract submission deadline: March 27</li>\n<li>Author notification: April 28</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submissions should consist of a title and a 1-2 pages abstract not including references, in pdf format, via &lt;<a href=\"https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hottuf2026\">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hottuf2026</a>&gt;. The intended speaker has to be picked on submission.</p>\n<p>Considering the broad background of the expected audience, we encourage authors to include information of pedagogical value in their abstract, such as motivation and context of their work.</p>\n<h3>Program committee</h3>\n<p>See &lt;<a href=\"https://hott-uf.github.io/2026/\">https://hott-uf.github.io/2026/</a>&gt;.</p>\n<h3>Organizers</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Felix Cherubini, <a href=\"mailto:felix.cherubini@posteo.de\">felix.cherubini@posteo.de</a> (University of Augsburg)</li>\n<li>Daniel Gratzer, <a href=\"mailto:gratzer@cs.au.dk\">gratzer@cs.au.dk</a> (Aarhus University)</li>\n<li>Axel Ljungström, <a href=\"mailto:axel.ljungstrom@nottingham.ac.uk\">axel.ljungstrom@nottingham.ac.uk</a> (University of Nottingham)</li>\n<li>Loïc Pujet, <a href=\"mailto:loic@pujet.fr\">loic@pujet.fr</a> (University of Strasbourg)</li>\n</ul>",
