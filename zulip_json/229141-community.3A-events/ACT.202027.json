We thank Gioele very much for volunteering to do this.</p>",

Often the head of the nation opens this conference!     Woit is wondering whether it should be moved.  ICM 2022 was scheduled to be held in St. Petersburg, and was cancelled when Russia invaded Ukraine.</p>\n<p>Woit asks what is happening to other international conferences scheduled to be held in the US.</p>",

        "content": "<p>There are abstract ethical problems with hosting conferences in countries like US, Russia and Israel. However, regardless of ones personal political beliefs regarding such countries, I think that it is much less controversial to observe that hosting conferences in such countries is inherently exclusionary, and will likely have the effect of lowering conference attendance.</p>\n<p>For each of these countries, there are a large number of people for whom entering the country is very difficult, if not impossible.  For example, very few people from Muslim majority countries can enter Israel (because of the policies of the state of Israel and the policies of their own governments).  Similarly, it is very difficult for people from the rest of Europe to enter Russia.  Similarly, the majority of the world, including most of the Muslim world, most of Africa, most of Asia are not usually granted visas for the United States in a timely manner, meaning they can not attend conferences in the USA without years of notice.  Therefore, in my opinion, hosting international conferences in such countries is inherently exclusionary, on top of the other moral qualms that are raised for all three of the examples I mentioned.</p>\n<p>At least having the option for speakers to be able to give talks online would slightly temper this exclusionary effect.  I remember at QPL in Orange California, basically all speakers from non western countries were not granted visas, and had to give online talks.  In academia, westerners already have a huge advantage, so organizing a conference in one country in the world which only grants visas to westerners in a timely fashion is just further confounding the western hegemony on academia.  I can't speak for other western countries, but I have never heard of an academic having problems obtaining a visa to talk at conferences in Canada, for example.</p>",
