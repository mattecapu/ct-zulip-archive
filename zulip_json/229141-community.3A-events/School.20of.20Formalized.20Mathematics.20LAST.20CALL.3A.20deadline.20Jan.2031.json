This is targeted towards junior researchers and mathematicians with little prior exposure to Formalization and Automated Theorem Proving and any others who are interested in this technology. </p>\n<p>Prospective participants can still apply at [1] DEADLINE: Jan. 31. 2024 (CET).</p>\n<p>At the school the major theorem proving systems and libraries are introduced by their developers. We envision it to be quite informal, hands-on, and interactive. We plan to have plenary sessions in the mornings 9-11 on Monday May 13 to introduce the systems in a ca. 20 min lightning talks, and in the remaining days present specific aspects of general interest of the systems (please volunteer two topics) in 40 min presentations. In the afternoons we will form small groups that get their hands dirty in specific formalization projects.</p>\n<p>[1] <a href=\"https://him-application.uni-bonn.de/index.php?id=5960\">https://him-application.uni-bonn.de/index.php?id=5960</a></p>",
