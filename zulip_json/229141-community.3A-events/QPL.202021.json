        "content": "<p>Hi all, the deadline for <a href=\"https://qpl2021.eu/\">*Quantum Physics and Logic*</a> is coming up in a month. The conference has always been very friendly towards categorical methods used to understand quantum theory better, so consider submitting something there. They accept both 12 page proceedings, as well as 3 page extended abstracts of results published elsewhere. See Call for Papers below.</p>\n<p>CALL FOR PAPERS</p>\n<p>QPL is an annual conference that brings together researchers working on mathematical foundations of quantum physics, quantum computing, and related areas, with a focus on structural perspectives and the use of logical tools, ordered algebraic and category-theoretic structures, formal languages, semantical methods, and other computer science techniques applied to the study of physical behaviour in general. Work that applies structures and methods inspired by quantum theory to other fields (including computer science) is also welcome.</p>\n<p>QPL 2021 will be held both virtually online and physically in Gdansk (COVID permitting).</p>\n<p>INVITED SPEAKERS</p>\n<p>Matty Hoban<br>\nFlaminia Giacomini<br>\nAnna Jencova<br>\nHlér Kristjánsson<br>\nAriel Bendersky<br>\nMartha Lewis</p>\n<p>IMPORTANT DATES</p>\n<p>Submission deadline: February 12, 2021<br>\nAuthor notification: March 31, 2021<br>\nEarly registration: May 14, 2021<br>\nProceedings paper ready: May 28, 2021<br>\nConference: June 7-11, 2021</p>\n<p>SUBMISSION GUIDELINES</p>\n<p>Recent work that is relevant to the conference is solicited in one (or more) of three tracks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Proceedings submissions consist of a 5-12 page extended abstract. Only proceedings-track submissions are eligible to be published in Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science (EPTCS) after the conference.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Non-proceedings submissions consist of a 3 page extended abstract and a link to a separate published paper, pre-print, or an attached draft.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Poster submissions consist of a 1-3 page abstract and may contain a link to a separate published paper or pre-print. Submission of partial results of work in progress is encouraged.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Submissions should be prepared using LaTeX, and must be submitted in PDF format. Use of the EPTCS style is encouraged. Submission is done via EasyChair: <a href=\"https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=qpl2021\">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=qpl2021</a></p>\n<p>BEST STUDENT PAPER</p>\n<p>There will be an award for the best student paper at the discretion of the programme committee. Papers eligible for the award are those where all the authors are students at the time of submission.</p>\n<p>PROGRAMME COMMITTEE</p>\n<p>Antonio Acin<br>\nBarbara Amaral<br>\nPablo Arrighi<br>\nMiriam Backens (co-chair)<br>\nJonathan Barrett<br>\nAlessandro Bisio<br>\nAnne Broadbent<br>\nUlysse Chabaud<br>\nBob Coecke<br>\nAlejandro Diaz-Caro<br>\nRoss Duncan<br>\nYuan Feng<br>\nAlexandru Gheorghiu<br>\nStefano Gogioso<br>\nTeiko Heinosaari<br>\nChris Heunen (co-chair)<br>\nMatthew Hoban<br>\nKohei Kishida<br>\nAleks Kissinger<br>\nRavi Kunjwal<br>\nCiaran Lee<br>\nMatt Leifer<br>\nMartha Lewis<br>\nShane Mansfield<br>\nSimon Martiel<br>\nHector Miller-Bakewell<br>\nMio Murao<br>\nGlaucia Murta<br>\nOgnyan Oreshkov<br>\nPrakash Panangaden<br>\nSimon Perdrix<br>\nLidia del Rio<br>\nJulien Ross<br>\nMehrnoosh Sadrzadeh<br>\nAna Belén Sainz<br>\nJohn Selby<br>\nRui Soares Barbosa<br>\nRob Spekkens<br>\nIsar Stubbe<br>\nBenoit Valiron<br>\nJamie Vicary<br>\nJohn van de Wetering<br>\nAlexander Wilce<br>\nMingsheng Ying<br>\nVladimir Zamdzhiev<br>\nMargherita Zorzi</p>",
