We point out the great affinity of these games to each other and call this phenomenon the strategic balance in logic. The three games penetrate into the heart of logic. Their mathematical interpretations and elaborations lead us into the deepest questions of mathematical logic, especially model theory and set theory. They provide tools for understanding central questions of philosophical logic such as intuitionistic, modal and other non-classical logic. They have become indispensable in theoretical computer science modelling interaction and complexity.</p>",
