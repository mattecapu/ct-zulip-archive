On the one hand, the Banach fixed point theorem is a staple of undergraduate courses on metric spaces. On the other, metric spaces can usefully be seen as enriched categories. This raises the question of whether the Banach fixed point theorem can be understood categorically. I will talk about the search for an answer, opening up avenues of investigation without, yet, being able to say what lies at the end of them.</p>\n</blockquote>",

October 4th.   Here's my talk:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Schur Functors</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The representation theory of the symmetric groups is clarified by thinking of all representations of all these groups as objects of a single category: the category of Schur functors. These play a universal role in representation theory, since Schur functors act on the category of representations of any group. We can understand this as an example of categorification. A \"rig\" is a \"ring without negatives\", and the free rig on one generator is <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"double-struck\">N</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">[</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">]</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathbb{N}[x]</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathbb\">N</span><span class=\"mopen\">[</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">x</span><span class=\"mclose\">]</span></span></span></span>, the rig of polynomials with natural number coefficients. Categorifying the concept of commutative rig we obtain the concept of \"symmetric 2-rig\", and it turns out that the category of Schur functors is the free symmetric 2-rig on one generator. Thus, in a certain sense, Schur functors are the next step after polynomials.</p>\n</blockquote>",
