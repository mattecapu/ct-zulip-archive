The workshop will be open for everyone to attend online, with recordings of the talks being uploaded after the workshop is finished.</p>\n<p>The workshop will hopefully be of interest to both those who are new to double categories and want to learn about the fundamental techniques and viewpoints, and also to domain specialists who are interested in technical results and current topics of active research. We also hope that this workshop will create a snapshot of the research area as it currently stands together with directions for future work, as well as provide an invitation to people wanting to know more about the area, or who are wondering if the tools or ideas in double category theory might be useful to their own research.</p>\n<p>This workshop follows from the first Virtual Double Categories Workshop held online in 2022. </p>\n<p>FORMAT AND REGISTRATION</p>\n<p>The workshop will be hosted on Zoom, and we welcome all participants.
