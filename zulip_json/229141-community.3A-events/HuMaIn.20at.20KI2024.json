We are especially open to interdisciplinary contributions. This includes ethical design principles for human-AI interaction, psychological foundations of human-AI interaction, artistic applications of (generative) AI, human-friendly robot and software interfaces, applications of AI in social robotics and healthcare, social science studies of AI applications, or the effects of AI on political discourse.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm kind of struggling to imagine what sort of thing I would even submit.</p>",
