It will take place at the Faculty of<br>\nMathematics and Physics, University of Ljubljana in Ljubljana, Slovenia, from<br>\nJune 1-3, 2026, where it will be colocated with the 3rd Workshop on Syntax and<br>\nSemantics of Type Theory (SSTT 2026), which is held from June 4-5, 2026.</p>\n<p>MFPS conferences are dedicated to the areas of mathematics, logic, and computer<br>\nscience that are related to models of computation in general, and to semantics<br>\nof programming languages in particular. This is a forum where researchers in<br>\nmathematics and computer science can meet and exchange ideas. The participation<br>\nof researchers in neighbouring areas is strongly encouraged.</p>\n<p>Topics include, but are not limited to, the following: bio-computation;<br>\nconcurrent qualitative and quantitative distributed systems; process calculi;<br>\nprobabilistic systems; constructive mathematics; domain theory and categorical<br>\nmodels; formal languages; formal methods; game semantics; lambda calculus;<br>\nprogramming language theory; quantum computation; security; topological models;<br>\nlogic; type systems; type theory; denotational and operational semantics;<br>\nrewrite theory; proof theory. We also welcome contributions that address<br>\napplications of semantics to novel areas.</p>\n<p>Participation in the meeting is expected to be in person; one author of every<br>\naccepted paper has to attend the meeting and give the presentation. Exceptions<br>\nmight be in case there are unexpected problems with travel/visa.</p>\n<p>Joint website of MFPS XLII and SSTT 2026: <a href=\"https://ul-fmf.github.io/mfps-sstt-2026/\">https://ul-fmf.github.io/mfps-sstt-2026/</a> </p>\n<h2>INVITED SPEAKERS AND SPECIAL SESSIONS</h2>\n<p>As in previous years, MFPS will have several invited speakers and special<br>\nsessions highlighting areas within programming languages semantics.
