Some advice on exactly how to set that up would be welcome. </p>\n<p>Would it be appropriate to have our own channel so we can have substreams for announcements, introductions, social things, and a dedicated thread for each talk? I figure we could set up some of this now for community building in advance of the conference. Eg, it seems possible that in-person participants might want to get in touch with each other to coordinate housing/travel. </p>\n<p>The hope is that this forum will help everyone feel more connected at a hybrid conference and also drive engagement to this zulip afterwards.</p>",
