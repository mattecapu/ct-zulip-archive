He called it \"La Nouvelle Eglise Universelle\". How does Grothendieck's text against scientism and the imperialism of science relate to his thought? How does it relate to his mathematics as well as to his ideas about religions ? Can it be said that Grothendieck had become against science or that, in some sense, he had always been against some form of science? These are some of the questions that will be addressed in this webinar. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.logicandreligion.com/webinars\">https://www.logicandreligion.com/webinars</a></p>",
