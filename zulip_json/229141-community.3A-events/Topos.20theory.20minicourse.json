We shall also present a characterization theorem for essential geometric morphisms and locally connected morphisms in terms of continuous functors, and a topos-theoretic interpretation of (a relative version) of the comprehensive factorization of a functor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the third part, we shall present a theorem providing necessary and sufficient explicit conditions for a morphism of sites to induce an equivalence of toposes; this generalizes Grothendieckâ€™s Comparison Lemma. Lastly, we shall give an overview of results characterizing important properties of geometric morphisms of toposes (such as being an inclusion, a surjection, hyperconnected, localic, local etc.) in terms of properties of morphisms or comorphisms of sites.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This material is taken from the monograph draft <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08737\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08737</a></p>",
