The Adjoint School has two main components: an online learning seminar that meets regularly between February and June, and an in-person research week held in the summer adjacent to the Applied Category Theory Conference.</p>\n<p>During the learning seminar, we will read, discuss, and respond to papers chosen by the project mentors. Every other week a pair of participants will present a paper which will be followed by a group discussion. After the learning seminar each pair of participants will also write a blog post, based on the paper they presented, for <a href=\"https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/\">The n-Category Cafe</a>. </p>\n<p><strong>Projects and Mentors</strong>: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Message Passing Logic for Categorical Quantum Mechanics - Mentor: Priyaa Srinivasan</li>\n<li>Behavioural Metrics, Quantitative Logics and Coalgebras - Mentor: Barbara König</li>\n<li>Concurrency in monoidal categories - Mentor: Chris Heunen</li>\n<li>Game Comonads and Finite Model Theory - Mentor: Dan Marsden</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Check more information about research projects at <a href=\"https://adjointschool.com/2023.html\">https://adjointschool.com/2023.html</a> </p>\n<p><strong>Organizers</strong>:</p>\n<p>Ana Luiza Tenorio <br>\nAngeline Aguinaldo<br>\nElena Di Lavore <br>\nNathan Haydon</p>",
