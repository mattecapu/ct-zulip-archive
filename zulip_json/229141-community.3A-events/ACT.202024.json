This year, the ACT conference will be co-located with the 40th conference on Mathematical Foundations of Programming Semantics (MFPS). This conference follows previous events at University of Maryland College Park (MD), Strathclyde (UK), Cambridge (UK), Cambridge (MA), Oxford (UK) and Leiden (NL).</p>\n<p>Call for Papers<br>\nApplied category theory is important to a growing community of researchers who study computer science, logic, engineering, physics, biology, chemistry, social science, systems, linguistics and other subjects using category-theoretic tools. The background and experience of our members is as varied as the systems being studied. The goal of the applied category theory conference series is to bring researchers together, strengthen the applied category theory community, disseminate the latest results, and facilitate further development of the field.</p>\n<p>Submissions<br>\nWe accept submissions in English of original research papers, talks about work accepted/submitted/published elsewhere, and demonstrations of relevant software. Accepted original research papers will be published in a proceedings volume. The conference will include an industry showcase event and community meeting. We particularly encourage people from underrepresented groups to submit their work and the organizers are committed to non-discrimination, equity, and inclusion.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>Conference papers should present original, high-quality work in the style of a computer science conference paper (up to 12 pages, not counting the bibliography; more detailed parts of proofs may be included in an appendix for the convenience of the reviewers). Such submissions should not be an abridged version of an existing journal article although pre-submission arxiv preprints are permitted. These submissions will be adjudicated for both a talk and publication in the conference proceedings.\n\nTalk proposals not to be published in the proceedings or about work accepted/submitted/published elsewhere,should be submitted as abstracts, one or two pages long. Authors are encouraged to include links to any full versions of their papers, preprints or manuscripts. The purpose of the abstract is to provide a basis for determining the topics and quality of the anticipated presentation.\n\nSoftware demonstration proposals should also be submitted as abstracts, one or two pages. The purpose of the abstract is to provide the program committee with enough information to assess the content of the demonstration.\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>The selected conference papers are expected to be published with EPTCS, and authors are advised to use the style files available at <a href=\"http://style.eptcs.org\">style.eptcs.org</a>.</p>\n<p>Submission, dates and deadlines:</p>\n<p>The exact deadline time on these dates is given by anywhere on earth (AoE).<br>\nAbstract registration by 26 March 2024<br>\nPapers due 29 March 2024<br>\nAuthor notification in 3 May 2024<br>\nConference 17 - 21 June 2024</p>\n<p>(Reviewing will be single-blind, and we are not making public the reviews, reviewer names, the discussions nor the list of under-review submissions. This is the same as previous instances of ACT.)</p>\n<p>Limited financial support will be available for travel. Priority will be given to people with financial need and those giving presentations. We are also aware that not everyone is able to travel to the UK, e.g. For visa reasons, and we will accommodate that in the programme via remote participation etc.. </p>\n<p>Please contact the organizers for more information.</p>\n<p>Program committee chairs:<br>\nDavid Jaz Myers (Abu Dhabi) and Michael Johnson (Sydney)</p>\n<p>Programme Committee:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>    Benedikt Ahrens, Delft University of Technology and University of Birmingham\n\nDylan Braithwaite, University of Strathclyde\n\nSpencer Breiner, NIST\n\nMatteo Capucci, University of Strathclyde\n\n    Titouan Carette, University of Latvia\n\nBryce Clarke, Inria Saclay Centre\n\nGreta Coraglia, University of Milan\n\nGeoffrey Cruttwell, Mount Allison University\n\nBojana Femic, Serbian Academy of Sciences And Arts\n\nFabio Gadducci, University of Pisa\n\nRichard Garner, Macquarie University\n\nNeil Ghani, University of Strathclyde\n\nAmar Hadzihasanovic, Tallinn University of Technology\n\nMartha Lewis, University of Bristol\n\nSophie Libkind, Topos Institute\n\nRory Lucyshyn-wright, Brandon University\n\nOwen Lynch, Topos Institute\n\nSean Moss, University of Oxford\n\nEvan Patterson, Topos Institute\n\nPaolo Perrone, University of Oxford\n\nPaige Randall North, University of Utrecht\n\nSophie Raynor, James Cook University\n\nEmily Roff, University of Edinburgh\n\nMorgan Rogers, Université Sorbonne Paris Nord\n\nMario Román, Tallinn University of Technology\n\nMaru Sarazola, University of Minnesota\n\nBas Spitters, Aarhus University\n\nPriyaa Varshinee Srinivasan, Topos Institute\n\nSam Staton, University of Oxford\n\nDario Stein, Radboud University Nijmegen\n\nEswaran Subrahmanian, Nist, CMU\n\nAna Luiza da Conceição Tenorio, University of São Paulo\n\n    Kobe Wullaert, Delft University of Technology\n\n    Ryan Wisnesky, Conexus\n\nVladimir Zamdzhiev, Inria\n\nFabio Zanasi, University College London\n\nMathew Di Meglio, University of Edinburgh\n</code></pre></div>",
