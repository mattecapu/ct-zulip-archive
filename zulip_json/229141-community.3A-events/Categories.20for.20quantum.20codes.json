        "content": "<p>Next monday, 8th of March at 2:15pm CET, I'm giving a talk about using the language of categories for quantum codes. <a href=\"https://chaos.if.uj.edu.pl/ZOA/\">https://chaos.if.uj.edu.pl/ZOA/</a>  The abstract: </p>\n<p>\"We use binary linear codes to store and transmit classical<br>\ninformation. These are length one chain complexes over a finite field.<br>\nQuantum (CSS) stabilizer codes can be seen as length two (or more) chain<br>\ncomplexes over a finite field. There are no complex numbers to be seen<br>\nhere, so what is quantum about quantum codes? One possible answer is<br>\nthat these codes, as chain complexes, live in a symmetric closed monoidal<br>\ncategory enriched over itself. This also applies to the category of finite dimensional<br>\ncomplex vector spaces, the usual context in which we do quantum<br>\ninformation theory. In this talk I will discuss these parallels using<br>\nstring diagram notation. As might be suspected, they key is the<br>\nbehaviour of the tensor product in both contexts.\"</p>",
