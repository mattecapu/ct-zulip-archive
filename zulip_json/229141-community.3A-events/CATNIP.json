The aim is to create an arena for the dissemination and the discussion of cutting-edge research in category theory, bringing together a community of mathematicians and theoretical computer scientists using category theory in their research. There will be three day-long meetings a year.   The first meeting will be held in Edinburgh Wednesday 14th June.</p>\n<p>(This is all I know: <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"301248\">@Chris Heunen</span> will eventually tell us more.)</p>",

The meeting is open to everybody. Participants from the three nodes may be offered travel reimbursement. We hope to be able to reimburse all staff and PhD students from the nodes, but if (depending on participants numbers) any budget issues arise priority will be given to PhD students and early career researchers.
