Formalizing mathematics involves expressing mathematical arguments in a precise language that such systems can understand. In recent years, an increasing amount of mathematics, from undergraduate topics to cutting-edge research, has been formalized in various proof assistants.</p>\n<p>This course will focus on Lean and its mathematical library, mathlib. Participants will learn how to formalize mathematical proofs and gain hands-on experience with Lean’s proof automation tools. This will enhance students' mathematical abilities and allow them to contribute to mathlib.</p>\n<p>The course is aimed at students familiar with rigorous mathematical reasoning who have an interest in theorem proving. It is particularly suitable for those in the later stages of a bachelor’s degree or pursuing a master's or PhD in mathematics, computer science, physics, or related fields.</p>\n<p>The participation fee for students is <strong>€200</strong>, which covers lunch and coffee breaks. If accommodation is required, this is also available for an additional fee.</p>\n<p>For more details and registration, please visit:<br>\n<a href=\"https://utrechtsummerschool.nl/courses/science/formalizing-mathematics-in-lean\">https://utrechtsummerschool.nl/courses/science/formalizing-mathematics-in-lean</a></p>",
