We will start the reviewing<br>\non <em>May 6, 2024</em> and accept applicants on a rolling basis.</p>\n<p>Overview<br>\n========<br>\nHomotopy Type Theory is an emerging field of mathematics that studies a<br>\nfruitful relationship between homotopy theory and (dependent) type<br>\ntheory. This relation plays a crucial role in Voevodsky's program of<br>\nUnivalent Foundations, a new approach to foundations of mathematics<br>\nbased on ideas from homotopy theory, such as the Univalence Principle.</p>\n<p>The UniMath library is a large repository of computer-checked<br>\nmathematics, developed from the univalent viewpoint. It is based on the<br>\ncomputer proof assistant Coq.</p>\n<p>In this school, we aim to introduce newcomers to the ideas of Univalent<br>\nFoundations and mathematics therein, and to the formalization of<br>\nmathematics in UniMath (<a href=\"https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath\">https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath</a>).</p>\n<p>This is our first school in the United States in the hope that students<br>\nin North America can participate more easily.</p>\n<p>Format<br>\n=======<br>\nParticipants will receive an introduction to Univalent Foundations and<br>\nto mathematics in those foundations. In the accompanying problem<br>\nsessions, they will formalize pieces of univalent mathematics in the<br>\nUniMath library.</p>\n<p>Prerequisites<br>\n==========<br>\nParticipants should be interested in mathematics and the use of<br>\ncomputers for mathematical reasoning. Participants do not need to have<br>\nprior knowledge of logic, Coq, or Univalent Foundations.</p>\n<p>Application and funding<br>\n=======================<br>\nPlease fill out the form (<a href=\"https://forms.gle/9PTB2V19hVuJsidz8\">https://forms.gle/9PTB2V19hVuJsidz8</a>).<br>\nFor information on how to participate, please visit<br>\n<a href=\"https://unimath.github.io/minneapolis2024\">https://unimath.github.io/minneapolis2024</a></p>\n<p>Best regards,<br>\nThe organizers Benedikt Ahrens and Favonia</p>",
