Submission deadline 29th March.<br>\nMFPS XL: Mathematical Foundations of Programming Semantics<br>\nCall for papers</p>\n<p>The 40th Conference on the Mathematical Foundations of Programming<br>\nSemantics (MFPS XL) takes place at the University of Oxford, UK, from<br>\n19-21 June 2024, where it will be colocated with the 7th International<br>\nConference on Applied Category Theory (ACT 2024).</p>\n<p>MFPS conferences are dedicated to the areas of mathematics, logic, and<br>\ncomputer science that are related to models of computation in general,<br>\nand to semantics of programming languages in particular. This is a forum<br>\nwhere researchers in computer science and mathematics can meet and<br>\nexchange ideas. The participation of researchers in neighbouring areas<br>\nis strongly encouraged.</p>\n<p>Topics include, but are not limited to, the following: bio-computation;<br>\nconcurrent qualitative and quantitative distributed systems; process<br>\ncalculi; probabilistic systems; constructive mathematics; domain theory<br>\nand categorical models; formal languages; formal methods; game<br>\nsemantics; lambda calculus; programming-language theory; quantum<br>\ncomputation; security; topological models; logic; type systems; type<br>\ntheory. We also welcome contributions that address applications of<br>\nsemantics to novel areas such as complex systems, markets, and networks,<br>\nfor example.</p>\n<p>Conference home page:<br>\n<a href=\"https://oxford24.github.io/&lt;https://url.au.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/6UVcCK1DOrCgB209CpcyRh?domain=oxford24.github.io\">https://oxford24.github.io/&lt;https://url.au.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/6UVcCK1DOrCgB209CpcyRh?domain=oxford24.github.io</a>&gt;<br>\nSUBMISSION<br>\nImportant dates:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>March 29: paper submission\nMay 3: notification of authors\nJune 3: conference papers ready\nJune 19–21: conference\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Submissions</p>\n<p>Submissions should be prepared using the MFPS macros in the form of a PDF file.<br>\nSubmission is via EasyChair.</p>\n<p>For the first time at MFPS, there are two submission categories:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>regular research contributions,\n\nearly announcements.\n</code></pre></div>\n\n<p>Early announcements are a new feature at MFPS XL. They offer a forum for<br>\nthe early presentation of new scientific contributions without the<br>\naccompanying technical justification that is expected in a regular<br>\nresearch contribution.</p>\n<p>The page limit for both kinds of submission is 15 pages, excluding<br>\nbibliography and appendices. However, it is expected that early<br>\nannouncements will typically be much shorter, taking only as many pages<br>\nas is required to present the announced contribution. Early<br>\nannouncements will be refereed primarily on their potential<br>\ninterest-value to the MFPS audience. Early announcements should be<br>\nidentified by clearly labelling them with \"Early Announcement\" at the<br>\nstart of the pdf document.</p>\n<p>Early announcements will be given equal presentation time to regular<br>\nresearch contributions at the conference.<br>\nProceedings</p>\n<p>A preliminary proceedings will be distributed at the meeting, containing<br>\nboth regular research contributions and early announcements.</p>\n<p>Final proceedings, containing regular research contributions only, will<br>\nbe published in Electronic Notes in Theoretical Informatics and Computer<br>\nScience (ENTICS <a href=\"https://entics.episciences.org/&lt;https://url.au.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/oU7rCNLJxkiKE019iV84Fx?domain=entics.episciences.org\">https://entics.episciences.org/&lt;https://url.au.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/oU7rCNLJxkiKE019iV84Fx?domain=entics.episciences.org</a>&gt;).
