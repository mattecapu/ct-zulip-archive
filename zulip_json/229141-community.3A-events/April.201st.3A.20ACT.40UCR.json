Here we introduce “structured cospans” as a way to study networks with inputs and outputs. Given a functor L: A → X, a structured cospan is a diagram in X of the form </p>\n<p>L(a) → x ← L(b).</p>\n<p>If A and X have finite colimits and L is a left adjoint, we obtain a symmetric monoidal category whose objects are those of A and whose morphisms are certain equivalence classes of structured cospans. However, this arises from a more fundamental structure: a symmetric monoidal double category where the horizontal 1-cells are structured cospans, not equivalence classes thereof. We explain the mathematics and illustrate it with an example from epidemiology.</p>",
