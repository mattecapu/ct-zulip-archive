In the last few years the scope of CMCS has become broader and embraced many research threads in Applied Category Theory. We invite submissions (with deadlines January 27 and March 2, depending on the type of contribution), as detailed in the call for papers:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.coalg.org/cmcs22/call-for-papers/\">https://www.coalg.org/cmcs22/call-for-papers/</a></p>\n<p>Note both original contributions (as regular papers) and work in progress/work submitted elsewhere (as short contributions) can be submitted. We will be announcing all the invited speakers soon, but I can anticipate familiar faces for the ACT community such as Ana Sokolova (Keynote), Sam Staton and Renato Neves, as well as a special session on data languages.</p>",
