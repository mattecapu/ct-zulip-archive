This conference follows previous events at MIT, Oxford and Leiden.</p>\n<p>Applied category theory is a topic of interest for a growing community of researchers, interested in studying many different kinds of systems using category-theoretic tools. These systems are found across computer science, mathematics, and physics, as well as in social science, linguistics, cognition, and neuroscience. The background and experience of our members is as varied as the systems being studied. The goal of the Applied Category Theory conference series is to bring researchers together, disseminate the latest results, and facilitate further development of the field.</p>\n<p>We accept submissions of both original research papers, and work accepted/submitted/ published elsewhere. Accepted original research papers will be invited for publication in a proceedings volume. The keynote addresses will be drawn from the best accepted papers. The conference will include an industry showcase event.</p>\n<p>We hope to run the conference as a hybrid event, with physical attendees present in Cambridge, and other participants taking part online. However, due to the state of the pandemic, the possibility of in-person attendance is not yet confirmed. Please do not book your travel or hotel accommodation yet.</p>\n<p><strong> IMPORTANT DATES (all in 2021) </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Submission of contributed papers:  Monday 10 May</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Acceptance/rejection notification:  Monday 7 June</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Adjoint school:  Monday 5 July to Friday 9 July</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Main conference:  Monday 12 July to Friday 16 July</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong> SUBMISSIONS </strong></p>\n<p>The following two types of submissions are accepted:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Proceedings Track. Original contributions of high-quality work consisting of an extended abstract, up to 12 pages, that provides evidence of results of genuine interest, and with enough detail to allow the program committee to assess the merits of the work. Submission of work-in-progress is encouraged, but it must be more substantial than a research proposal.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Non-Proceedings Track. Descriptions of high-quality work submitted or published elsewhere will also be considered, provided the work is recent and relevant to the conference. The work may be of any length, but the program committee members may only look at the first 3 pages of the submission, so you should ensure that these pages contain sufficient evidence of the quality and rigour of your work.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Papers in the two tracks will be reviewed against the same standards of quality. Since ACT is an interdisciplinary conference, we use two tracks to accommodate the publishing conventions of different disciplines. For example, those from a Computer Science background may prefer the Proceedings Track, while those from a Mathematics, Physics or other background may prefer the Non-Proceedings Track. However, authors from any background are free to choose the track that they prefer, and submissions may be moved from the Proceedings Track to the Non-Proceedings Track at any time at the request of the authors.</p>\n<p>Contributions must be submitted in PDF format. Submissions to the Proceedings Track must be prepared with LaTeX, using the EPTCS style files available at <a href=\"http://style.eptcs.org\">http://style.eptcs.org</a>.</p>\n<p>The submission link will soon be available on the ACT2021 web page: <a href=\"https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/act2021\">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/act2021</a></p>\n<p><strong> PROGRAMME COMMITTEE </strong></p>\n<p>Chair: Kohei Kishida, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign</p>\n<p>The full programme committee will be announced soon.</p>\n<p><strong> LOCAL ORGANIZERS </strong></p>\n<p>Lukas Heidemann, University of Oxford<br>\nNick Hu, University of Oxford<br>\nIoannis Markakis, University of Cambridge<br>\nAlex Rice, University of Cambridge<br>\nCalin Tataru, University of Cambridge<br>\nJamie Vicary, University of Cambridge</p>\n<p><strong> STEERING COMMITTEE </strong></p>\n<p>John Baez, University of California Riverside and Centre for Quantum Technologies<br>\nBob Coecke, Cambridge Quantum Computing<br>\nDavid Spivak, Topos Institute</p>",

This conference follows previous events at MIT, Oxford and Leiden.</p>\n<p>Applied category theory is a topic of interest for a growing community of researchers, interested in studying many different kinds of systems using category-theoretic tools. These systems are found across computer science, mathematics, and physics, as well as in social science, linguistics, cognition, and neuroscience. The background and experience of our members is as varied as the systems being studied. The goal of the Applied Category Theory conference series is to bring researchers together, disseminate the latest results, and facilitate further development of the field.</p>\n<p>For a full schedule of talks, please see <a href=\"https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/act2021/#programme\">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/act2021/#programme</a>.</p>\n<p>The conference will be run as a hybrid event, with physical attendees present in Cambridge, and other participants taking part online. Physical registration is now closed, but online registration is still available: <a href=\"https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/act2021/#registration\">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/act2021/#registration</a>.</p>\n<p><strong> PROGRAMME COMMITTEE </strong></p>\n<p>Chair:</p>\n<p>- Kohei Kishida, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign</p>\n<p>Members:</p>\n<p>- Richard Blute, University of Ottawa<br>\n  - Spencer Breiner, NIST<br>\n  - Daniel Cicala, University of New Haven<br>\n  - Robin Cockett, University of Calgary<br>\n  - Bob Coecke, Cambridge Quantum Computing<br>\n  - Geoffrey Cruttwell, Mount Allison University<br>\n  - Valeria de Paiva, Samsung Research America and University of Birmingham<br>\n  - Brendan Fong, Massachusetts Institute of Technology<br>\n  - Jonas Frey, Carnegie Mellon University<br>\n  - Tobias Fritz, Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics<br>\n  - Fabrizio Romano Genovese, Statebox<br>\n  - Helle Hvid Hansen, University of Groningen<br>\n  - Jules Hedges, University of Strathclyde<br>\n  - Chris Heunen, University of Edinburgh<br>\n  - Alex Hoffnung, Bridgewater<br>\n  - Martti Karvonen, University of Ottawa<br>\n  - Kohei Kishida, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (chair)<br>\n  - Martha Lewis, University of Bristol<br>\n  - Bert Lindenhovius, Johannes Kepler University Linz<br>\n  - Ben MacAdam, University of Calgary<br>\n  - Dan Marsden, University of Oxford<br>\n  - Jade Master, University of California, Riverside<br>\n  - Joe Moeller, NIST<br>\n  - Koko Muroya, Kyoto University<br>\n  - Simona Paoli, University of Leicester<br>\n  - Daniela Petrisan, Universit=C3=A9 de Paris, IRIF<br>\n  - Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh, University College London<br>\n  - Peter Selinger, Dalhousie University<br>\n  - Michael Shulman, University of San Diego<br>\n  - David Spivak, MIT and Topos Institute<br>\n  - Joshua Tan, University of Oxford<br>\n  - Dmitry Vagner<br>\n  - Jamie Vicary, University of Cambridge<br>\n  - John van de Wetering, Radboud University Nijmegen<br>\n  - Vladimir Zamdzhiev, Inria, LORIA, Université de Lorraine<br>\n  - Maaike Zwart</p>",
