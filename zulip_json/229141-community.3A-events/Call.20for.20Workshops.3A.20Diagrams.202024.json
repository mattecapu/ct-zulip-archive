The conference fosters multi-disciplinarity and allows researchers from areas such as computer science, mathematics, psychology, philosophy, history (of science, art, etc.), education research, and more to meet and share their perspectives on the theory and application of diagrams.</p>\n<p>We invite proposals for half-day or full-day workshops. These workshops will be held on the first (Friday, September 27) and the last (Tuesday, October 1) conference day. They will occur at the main conference venue at Münster University in Germany.</p>\n<p>Workshops are expected to address topics of interest to the Diagrams 2024 conference attendees. These include but are not limited to, the issues of interest found on the Main Track, Philosophy Track, and Psychology &amp; Education Track Calls pages at: <a href=\"http://www.diagrams-conference.org/2024\">www.diagrams-conference.org/2024</a>.</p>\n<p>Examples of previous Workshops include: </p>\n<p>·      International Workshop on Set Visualisation and Reasoning</p>\n<p>·      The International Workshop on Euler Diagrams</p>\n<p>·      Technology-Enhanced Diagrams Research</p>\n<p>·      Accessible Graphics: Graphics for Vision Impaired People</p>\n<p>At least one of the organizers of an accepted Workshop submission will be expected to attend the conference.</p>\n<p>For more information, see: <a href=\"https://diagrams-2024.diagrams-conference.org/calls/workshops/\">https://diagrams-2024.diagrams-conference.org/calls/workshops/</a>  </p>\n<hr>\n<p>SUBMISSION</p>\n<p>A Workshop proposal must contain:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A single page listing: </li>\n</ol>\n<p>a.     the title of the workshop, </p>\n<p>b.     the names and contact information for all organizers,</p>\n<p>c.     brief biographies of the main organizers.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<p>A description of the topic and rationale for the workshop, including a brief description of why the workshop will be relevant to Diagrams 2024 conference attendees.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A Call for Participation document of up to 500 words that can be used to advertise the workshop on the Diagrams 2024 website.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Submission date for workshop proposals: March 1, 2024.</p>\n<p>Notification for acceptance of workshops:  March 15, 2024.</p>\n<p>Workshop organizers are expected to distribute their call for abstracts and solicit abstracts for submission shortly after notification.
