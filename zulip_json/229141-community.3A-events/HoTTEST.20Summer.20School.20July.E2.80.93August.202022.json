The lectures<br>\nwill be delivered live (between 2:30-4pm UTC) and paired with various<br>\ntutorial sessions run by teaching assistants. The course will also<br>\nfeature a discord-based all-hours Q&amp;A and an online archive of all<br>\ncourse materials so that participants can follow along on their own<br>\nschedule.</p>\n<p>This school is for everyone and anyone with some familiarity with<br>\nabstract mathematics or theoretical computer science and an itching to<br>\nlearn about homotopy type theory. Our goal is to make homotopy type<br>\ntheory accessible to, and inclusive of, everyone who is interested,<br>\nregardless of cultural background, age, ability, formal education,<br>\nethnicity, gender identity, or expression. We believe HoTT is for<br>\neveryone, and are committed to fostering a kind, inclusive environment.</p>\n<p>The first part of the course will include parallel introductions to<br>\nhomotopy type theory and formalization given by Ulrik Buchholtz, Martín<br>\nHötzel Escardó, Dan Licata, Anders Mörtberg, Paige North, Emily Riehl,<br>\nand Egbert Rijke. The summer school will then close with a series of<br>\ncolloquia introducing more advanced topics and exciting areas for<br>\nfurther study delivered by Pierre Cagne, Favonia, Jonas Frey, Jon<br>\nSterling, and Chaitanya Leena Subramaniam.  A team of teaching<br>\nassistants which includes Elisabeth Bonnevier, Tom de Jong, Jarl G.<br>\nTaxerås Flaten, Artem Gureev, Perry Hart, Astra Kolomatskaia, Amélia<br>\nLiao, Jacob Neumann, Johannes Schipp von Branitz, and Christopher<br>\nStough-Brown among others, will lead problem sessions and assist<br>\nstudents with exercises.</p>\n<p>A central aim of the summer school is to build community among all of<br>\nthe participants, irrespective of geography.  To further this, we will<br>\nhold some online social events (e.g. game nights) for the summer school<br>\nstaff and participants.</p>\n<p>More details about the course logistics and the scientific program will<br>\nbe announced soon on the summer school website:<br>\n<a href=\"https://uwo.ca/math/faculty/kapulkin/seminars/hottest_summer_school_2022.html\">https://uwo.ca/math/faculty/kapulkin/seminars/hottest_summer_school_2022.html</a></p>\n<p>In the meanwhile, we invite everyone to join us on the summer school<br>\nDiscord group to hang out and get to know one another:<br>\n<a href=\"https://discord.gg/tkhJ9zCGs9\">https://discord.gg/tkhJ9zCGs9</a></p>\n<p>If you would like to participate in some background surveys that will<br>\nshape the design of the curriculum, please register for the Discord by<br>\nMay 15th, but students are also welcome to join in at any time.</p>\n<p>On behalf of the organizers,<br>\nCarlo Angiuli, Dan Christensen, Martín Hötzel Escardó, Chris Kapulkin,<br>\nDan Licata, Emily Riehl, Egbert Rijke</p>",
