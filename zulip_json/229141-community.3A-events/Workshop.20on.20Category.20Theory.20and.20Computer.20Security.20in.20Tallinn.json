Computer security is a source of particularly complex processes, often specified in an ad-hoc manner, for example in security proofs concerning cryptographic protocols. The purpose of this workshop is to explore the potential of categorical methods in modelling situations that arise in computer security and cryptography.</p>\n<p>To register and/or propose a 30 minute talk, please email <a href=\"mailto:cneste@taltech.ee\">cneste@taltech.ee</a> no later than 01/03/2024. </p>\n<p>A limited amount of money is available to fund the travel and/or accommodation of speakers who would otherwise be unable to attend. If you require such funding (and would like to speak at the workshop), please mention this in your registration email.</p>\n<p>The workshop is funded by the Cyber-Security Excellence Hub in Estonia and South Moravia (CHESS), which is funded by the European Union under Grant Agreement No. 101087529.</p>",
