It's designed to both attract newcomers as well as to be of interest to the ACT community as a whole. For example, we will have introductory talks overviewing the subject (John Baez kindly agreed to do this), established researchers that reach the mainstream audience (Eugenia Cheng has kindly agreed to speak at the special session), as well as specialists across the academic spectrum talking about their own projects (Olivia Caramello and Ben Bumpus, for example).</p>\n<p>We already sent out invitations to present a poster to the MRC participants, and in the near future we will be sending out a general invitation for posters.</p>",
