I'm excited to get a chance to speak <em>both</em> about the future of theoretical physics <em>and</em> the climate crisis.   You can attend if you want.  I don't know if the talk is being recorded.</p>\n<p><strong>Title:</strong> Theoretical Physics in the 21st Century</p>\n<p><strong>Time:</strong> Monday, 8 March 2021, 15:45 UTC (that is, Greenwich Mean Time).</p>\n<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The 20th century was the century of physics. What about the 21st? Though progress on some old problems is frustratingly slow, exciting new questions are emerging in condensed matter physics, nonequilibrium thermodynamics and other fields. And most of all, the 21st century is the dawn of the Anthropocene, in which we will adapt to the realities of life on a finite-​sized planet. How can physicists help here?</p>\n<p><strong>Hosts:</strong> Niklas Beisert, Anna Knörr.</p>\n<p><strong>Zoom link:</strong> <a href=\"https://ethz.zoom.us/j/97304880591\">https://ethz.zoom.us/j/97304880591</a></p>",
