While I enjoyed Christine's talks, I still don't see the motivation for this notion, perhaps because of lack of background in the algebraic topology that motivated Eilenberg and MacLane.  Is it possible to motivate this notion, given that I already care about the modern notion of polynomial functors, as in the work of David Spivak?</p>",
