We describe three different 2-categories and show that they are 2-equivalent, then proceed to analyze the benefits of each of the three. The fact that one can precisely relate such different perspectives allows, for example, for a swift and cleaner treatment of type constructors: we show how certain categorical models for dependent types come inherently equipped with some due to the choices one makes in introducing tools to interpret context extension.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Joachim Kock, <strong>Decomposition spaces, right fibrations, and edgewise subdivision</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Decomposition spaces are simplicial infinity-groupoids subject to an exactness condition weaker than the Segal condition. Where the Segal condition expresses composition, the weak condition expresses decomposition. The motivation for studying decomposition spaces is that they have incidence coalgebras and Möbius inversion. The most important class of simplicial maps for decomposition spaces are the CULF maps (standing for 'conservative' and 'unique-lifting-of-factorisation'), first studied by Lawvere; they induce coalgebra homomorphisms. The theorem I want to arrive at in the talk says that the infinity-category of (Rezk-complete) decomposition spaces and CULF maps is locally an infinity-topos. More precisely for each (Rezk-complete) decomposition space D, the slice infinity-category Decomp/D is equivalent to PrSh(Sd(D)), the infinity-topos of presheaves on the edgewise subdivision of D. Most of the talk will be spent on explaining preliminaries, though.<br>\nThis is joint work with Philip Hackney.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The zoom link is the following: <a href=\"https://stockholmuniversity.zoom.us/j/68792232558\">https://stockholmuniversity.zoom.us/j/68792232558</a><br>\nWhile the Fest website is this one: <a href=\"https://progetto-itaca.github.io/pages/fest22.html\">https://progetto-itaca.github.io/pages/fest22.html</a><br>\nYou also find the series on <a href=\"https://researchseminars.org/seminar/ItaCa-Fest-2022\">researchseminars.org</a>, and on the <a href=\"https://calendar.google.com/calendar/render?cid=http%3A%2F%2Fresearchseminars.org%2Fuser%2Fics%2FIjYxMDAi.w0XOQWGJA2ijEbleFYo3a1-1H54\">CT Zulip calendar</a>.</p>",

In this talk we introduce tape diagrams, a graphical language for expressing arrows of arbitrary finite biproduct rig categories, and we show how the calculus of relation can be encoded within tape diagrams.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ingo Blechschmidt, <strong>Reifying dynamical algebra</strong><br>\n<em>or: Traveling the mathematical multiverse to apply tools for the countable also to the uncountable</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Commutative algebra abounds with proofs which are quite elegant and at<br>\nthe same time quite abstract. Even for concrete statements, proofs often<br>\nappeal to transfinite methods like the axiom of choice or the law of<br>\nexcluded middle. Following Hilbert’s call, we should work to elucidate how these abstract<br>\nproofs can be recast in more concrete, computational terms, regarding<br>\nabstract proofs as intriguing guiding templates for formulating concrete<br>\nproofs and regarding objects concocted by Zorn’s lemma such as maximal<br>\nideals as convenient fictions. One such technique for making<br>\ncomputational sense of abstract proofs is dynamical algebra, going back<br>\nto the work of Dominique Duval and her coauthors in the 1980's.<br>\nThe talk will first present the basic story of dynamical algebra with an<br>\nillustrative example. Then we will report on joint work with Peter<br>\nSchuster how to reify dynamical algebra using formal metatheorems of<br>\ncategorical logic, supplying a firm foundation to dynamical algebra,<br>\ncomplementing previous approaches. A particular feature of our approach is that we apply a construction<br>\ndevised by Berardi and Valentini for the special case of countable<br>\nrings, which indeed fundamentally requires the countability assumption,<br>\nby a logical sleight of hand by Joyal and Tierney to arbitrary rings.<br>\nThis trick is applicable quite generally which is why we believe that it<br>\nis of interest to a larger group of people. It is unlocked by<br>\ncategorical logic running on a certain fractal without points, the<br>\npointfree space of enumerations of a given set.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The zoom link is the following: <a href=\"https://stockholmuniversity.zoom.us/j/68792232558\">https://stockholmuniversity.zoom.us/j/68792232558</a><br>\nWhile the Fest website is this one: <a href=\"https://progetto-itaca.github.io/pages/fest22.html\">https://progetto-itaca.github.io/pages/fest22.html</a><br>\nYou also find the series on <a href=\"https://researchseminars.org/seminar/ItaCa-Fest-2022\">researchseminars.org</a>, and on the <a href=\"https://calendar.google.com/calendar/render?cid=http%3A%2F%2Fresearchseminars.org%2Fuser%2Fics%2FIjYxMDAi.w0XOQWGJA2ijEbleFYo3a1-1H54\">CT Zulip calendar</a>.</p>",

A finite product preserving functor F from B to Set necessarily factors through the category Ab of abelian groups. This simple and important observation has no straightforward generalization when F and Set are replaced by a pseudo-functor and the 2-category Cat of categories, respectively. The latter situation occurs precisely when B is the base category of an opfibration. In this talk, we will focus on pseudo-functors corresponding to cartesian monoidal opfibrations of codomain B. Among such, we will eventually characterize, in terms of oplax and lax monoidal structure, those factorizing through the bicategory of symmetric categorical groups. This is the case, for example, when the starting opfibration has groupoidal fibres. This is joint work with S. Mantovani and G. Metere.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Luca Reggio, <strong>Arboreal categories and homomorphism preservation theorems</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Game comonads, introduced by Abramsky, Dawar et al. in 2017, provide a categorical approach to (finite) model theory. In this framework one can capture, in a purely syntax-free way, various resource-sensitive logic fragments and corresponding combinatorial parameters. After an introduction to game comonads, I shall present an axiomatic framework which captures the essential common features of these constructions. This is based on the notion of arboreal category, in which every object is generated by its `paths’. I will then show how (resource-sensitive) homomorphism preservation theorems in logic can be recast and proved at this axiomatic level. This is joint work with Samson Abramsky.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The zoom link is the following: <a href=\"https://cs-ox-ac-uk.zoom.us/j/97878376376?pwd=QithMyt5NzdOeE1EWGJRcjBxamxnUT09\">https://cs-ox-ac-uk.zoom.us/j/97878376376?pwd=QithMyt5NzdOeE1EWGJRcjBxamxnUT09</a> ( <span aria-label=\"left\" class=\"emoji emoji-2b05\" role=\"img\" title=\"left\">:left:</span> different than usual!)<br>\nWhile the Fest website is this one: <a href=\"https://progetto-itaca.github.io/pages/fest22.html\">https://progetto-itaca.github.io/pages/fest22.html</a><br>\nYou also find the series on <a href=\"https://researchseminars.org/seminar/ItaCa-Fest-2022\">researchseminars.org</a>, and on the <a href=\"https://calendar.google.com/calendar/render?cid=http%3A%2F%2Fresearchseminars.org%2Fuser%2Fics%2FIjYxMDAi.w0XOQWGJA2ijEbleFYo3a1-1H54\">CT Zulip calendar</a>.</p>",

It unifies and improves on previous work on operadic notions of system theory, and provides a strong conceptual scaffolding for behavioral system theory. However, some of the most interesting systems out there escape the simple model of dynamical systems. They are instead cybernetic systems, or in other words, controllable dynamical systems. Notable and motivating examples are strategic games and machine learning models.

In most cases of interest, triangulated structures can be enhanced to more highly structured objects with better properties. The search for appropriate enhancements of triangulated categories has led to various foundational approaches in stable homotopy theory. In the context of \\infty-categories (or quasi-categories), this involves the notion of stable \\infty-category. Indeed, the homotopy 1-category of a stable \\infty-category is canonically triangulated. But what about n-categories for 1 &lt; n &lt; \\infty? Is there an appropriate notion of stable (or triangulated) category in the context of n-categories that interpolates between stable \\infty-categories and triangulated categories? The main examples should again be the homotopy n-categories of stable \\infty-categories. In this talk, I will discuss the relevant properties of higher homotopy categories leading to a notion of stable n-category. If time permits, I will also mention some uses of this notion of stable n-category for (higher) Brown representability and algebraic K-theory.</p>\n</blockquote>",
