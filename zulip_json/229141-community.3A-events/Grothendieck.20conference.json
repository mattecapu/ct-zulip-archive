This is standard practice for math talks now.   It's easy if you're recording the talks already, and it's good to do.  It's not every day that so many experts on Grothendieck give talks about his work!  This would preserve those talks for posterity, and after a few years the number of people who watch these talks will easily reach 10 times the number of people who attend the conference either in person or remotely.</p>\n</blockquote>",
