Recently I came across the \"state chart\" visual formalism outlined in this paper: <a href=\"https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/seoc/2005_2006/resources/statecharts.pdf\">https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/seoc/2005_2006/resources/statecharts.pdf</a>, which allows for \"superstates\" and allows complex state diagrams to be simplified via stratification. I was wondering if these state charts can be accounted for coalgebraically, and if so, how?</p>",
