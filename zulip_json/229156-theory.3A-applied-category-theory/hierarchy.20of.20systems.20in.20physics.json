For example, the abstraction of \"resistivity\" is convenient for the electrical engineer who prefers not to imagine individual electrons bumping into nuclei.  So the hierarchy or directed acyclic graph you seek might be some quotient of the graph of back-references in the definitions in a physics textbook series such as Landau's.  Does that sound right to you?</p>",
