If you are talking about scaling the output of a transformation, then this is again going to produce more arrows rather than living \"in\" the objects. Either way, if the morphisms between pairs of objects have some structure (like scaling by scalars in some fixed ring) which is compatible with composition, then you might want to consider an enriched category.</p>",
