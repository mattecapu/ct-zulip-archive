The current set of integrated data was then responsive to transfer operators based on impulse forces to climate change. This is the first time a large composite climate data model has generated so many climate phenomena.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Predicting Climate Change through Response Operators in a Coupled General Circulation Model</em></strong><br>\n<strong>Abstract.</strong><br>\nGlobal Climate Models are key tools for predicting the future response of the climate system to a variety of natural and anthropogenic forcings. Here we show how to use statistical mechanics to construct operators able to flexibly predict climate change. We perform our study using a fully coupled model - MPI-ESM v.1.2 - and for the first time we prove the effectiveness of response theory in predicting future climate response to CO2 increase on a vast range of temporal scales, from inter-annual to centennial, and for very diverse climatic variables. We investigate within a unified perspective the transient climate response and the equilibrium climate sensitivity, and assess the role of fast and slow processes. The prediction of the ocean heat uptake highlights the very slow relaxation to a newly established steady state. The change in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC ) is accurately predicted. The AMOC strength is initially reduced and then undergoes a slow and partial recovery. The ACC strength initially increases due to changes in the wind stress, then undergoes a slowdown, followed by a recovery leading to a overshoot with respect to the<br>\ninitial value. Finally, we are able to predict accurately the temperature change in the North Atlantic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Data</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These common dataset forcings are stored and coordinated by input4MIPS (input datasets for Model Intercomparison Projects). </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Historical Short-Lived Climate Forcers (SLCF) and GHG (CO2 and CH4) Emissions</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Biomass Burning Emissions</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Global Gridded Land-use Forcing Datasets</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Historical greenhouse gases (GHG) concentrations: a full description is published via the CMIP6 Special Issue publication</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ozone Concentrations and Nitrogen (N)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Aerosol Optical Properties and Relative Change in Cloud Droplet Number Concentration  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Solar Forcing</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Stratospheric Aerosol Data Set</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>AMIP Sea Surface Temperature and Sea Ice Datasets</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Beyond these historical forcings, CMIP6 also has a common set of future scenarios comprising land use and emissions as required for the future Shared Socio-Economic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs).</p>\n</blockquote>",
