When it comes to generating actual numbers for something nontrivial, debugging becomes a nightmare. It takes several minutes to do the plumbing necessary just to get the outer system to output information I can actually analyze.</p>\n<p>Something obvious only happened to occurr to me this week: there's nothing Poly can do that Set can't, really. A dynamical system is just a morphism? Great, it actually is just a morphism in Set also (albeit one that is a giant composition of functions). If you care about type safety, just write Haskell code and use Debug.trace when developing something.</p>\n<p>I'm asking this with love of course. I've been excited about the category and have loved working with it, but debugging it versus debugging a little matlab benchmark has caused some existential angst. \"Why is anyone even doing this? is it just a cute coincidence that if you take a subcategory of the yoneda embedding you preserve the ability to express dynamical systems? is this actually practical?\" etc.</p>",

        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"275901\">@Jules Hedges</span> Now I can post what I was working on, because it FINALLY WORKS.<br>\nI was trying to model a <a href=\"https://martinuzzifrancesco.github.io/posts/a-brief-introduction-to-reservoir-computing/\">reservoir computer</a>, which is a recurrent neural network that learns how to predict nonlinear time series. It has two basic components: a reservoir of dynamics and a readout layer. The reservoir of dynamics is any large \"box\" containing a dynamical system with nonlinear dynamics (one doesn't have to understand it), so it's usually implemented via a recurrent neural network where all nodes are connected to all others (there's alternatives but I wont discuss the reservoir literature). The readout layer is like in a regular neural network: it reads from the nodes in the reservoir and multiplies some weights. The big advantage is that you don't train anything but the output layer, so no backprop shenanigans, you can just use linear regression.</p>\n<p>The basic idea is, the output layer learns to represent the time series in terms of the dynamics of the reservoir, which is huge compared to the input so it ought to be enough to represent the time series. AFAIK reservoirs are also used for general computation, its part of a broader field of neuromorphic computation.</p>\n<p>There's 3 stages: when youre feeding the data, then you hit the reservoir with part of your timeseries to predict to get rid of transient dynamics, then you make the readout layer loop back on the reservoir, and this last stage is when you count its output as a prediction. So in terms of poly, this to me suggested a mode-dependent dynamical system like in the first image linked.<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/tfTIUNxpVnszw7HgxJCs0kwP/PXL_20230516_144114703.jpg\">PXL_20230516_144114703.jpg</a><br>\nand this is what I was trying to make work, but its problematic for several reasons. one is that the reservoir of dynamics should not have mode-dependence at all, because it just takes an input, multiplies with its weights, and produces an output, it never cares where stuff comes from. Second, the readout layer shouldn't care about \"touching\" and \"going\" states, it only accumulates enough data to train.</p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/tfTIUNxpVnszw7HgxJCs0kwP/PXL_20230516_144114703.jpg\" title=\"PXL_20230516_144114703.jpg\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/21317/tfTIUNxpVnszw7HgxJCs0kwP/PXL_20230516_144114703.jpg\"></a></div><p>To cut to the chase, I tried to solve this by splitting up the \"res\" box in the image in two: the reservoir and the readout (second image <br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/D_NTTHwoOZudNePRdBSf2_nq/PXL_20230516_144129056.jpg\">PXL_20230516_144129056.jpg</a>) . but now I needed some outside \"controller\" to distinguish between the \"touching\" and \"going\" states, and what I discovered is that this is a mess in this setup: delays between the propagation of states started creating inconsistencies, and impossible combinations of states needed to be handled (the controller outputting \"Touch\" while the readout was still \"training\" - I didn't find a way to make such a thing unrepresentable, because all the wiring pattern lens has access to is the output of the systems).  I tried some hacks with making the controller output \"transition\" states for a single timestep, but it became even more of a spaghetti mess. So I just went back to keeping the entire state (and associated counters) within the \"res\" box and having the \"global\" state centralized.</p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/D_NTTHwoOZudNePRdBSf2_nq/PXL_20230516_144129056.jpg\" title=\"PXL_20230516_144129056.jpg\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/21317/D_NTTHwoOZudNePRdBSf2_nq/PXL_20230516_144129056.jpg\"></a></div><p>moral of the story: (distributed) state is hard</p>",
