In the same way that in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3443.pdf\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3443.pdf</a> the authors calculated the homotopy groups of spheres using HoTT, I'm wondering if we could e.g. calculate some simpler thing about a real world structure for which GML exists (like a famous Church etc) using HoTT methods.  Any thoughts?</p>",

I'm asking for help exhaustively enumerating all the ways two polygons can overlap, and for each such way, figuring out what to do with the associated HoTT code.  For example, assume we have six squares that form a cube.  This gives six HoTT inductive types.  Based on the fact that the squares overlap on edges, these six types should get merged into one type with six \"square\" constructors, resulting in the HoTT code for the cube.  Presumably, there is some systematic way of doing this that I'm asking for help finding.</p>",
