Using the intuition I got from my already worked out example, I tried to find other instances where I could apply my result. I did have a few leads but none of them worked out (implying, I guess, that my intuition is not that great).</p>\n<p>I was wondering what you like to do when this stuff happens. Do you just keep the result for yourself? Do you only talk about it to people close to you? Or do you share it online?</p>\n<p>I feel like, obviously, one would want to share it with as many people as possible in case someone can use the result. However, the amount of time possibly wasted on an incomplete idea by you and the community grows with the number of people you share it with, so I do not know if it is really that helpful to share it so much. Actually, having looked at many professor's websites, I have never seen a section for inconclusive research, so I think my opinion is probably shared.</p>\n<p>For this time, I'll share my result <a href=\"#narrow/stream/229136-theory.3A-category.20theory/topic/Splitting.20an.20idempotent.20to.20quotient.20a.20monad/near/243192620\">here</a> and see what happens (maybe it also gives you a better idea about what I mean).</p>",
