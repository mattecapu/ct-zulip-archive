That should be a nice thing to do; probably not that much for the application I wanted but in general. I knew of David's work but had been paying more attention to the bicategorical case until Edward Morehouse and now you pointed this again to me. I guess that for my application the graphical calculus of <em>symmetric monoidal</em> double categories should work more or less similarly, and I guess a clear advantage of the double category is that it separates functors and profunctors nicely (avoiding the awkward: \"left adjoint, but also Cauchy completion on the domain\"). </p>\n<p>Long form: Thank you, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"276072\">@sarahzrf</span>, for pointing that. I agree, I knew (the first part of) that paper; although I decided to go with monoidal bicategories because they were more familiar to me and they seemed to justify nicely the relation with monoidal diagrams. In any case, trying to use the double version of these things would be really nice.  I understand that the idea would be to go to <em>symmetric monoidal</em> double categories. Also, Edward Morehouse (who I think is working on these) pointed me to the fact that I should be trying to see how the story worked in monoidal double categories; I think you both are right, that should be a clear \"further work\" on what I was doing.  Let me try to link here what I know related to that, in case it helps anyone:</p>\n<p>Maybe it was David Jaz Myers that proposed us to use these diagrams during the ACT school. I think David Dalrymple drew a lot of optics diagrams in double categories on Twitter.  There is also this paper by <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.01093v1.pdf\">Sprunger and Katsumata</a> that I looked into and does something with \"double categories with one object\" (I think David Dalrymple also cites it). Also, Chad Nester may be able to say more on that, he was working with similar things at the same time (with different applications in mind).</p>\n<p>But then I went back to monoidal bicategories for <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.04526\">this paper</a>.  As you say, you can still repeat that in monoidal bicategories, it is just that you need to decide to bend some wire (which, in the particular application I wanted is fine, in general, it feels a bit awkward).  The fact that it was awkward pushed me to consider the <em>pointed profunctors</em>. I learnt a trick like the one you mention from Marsden's <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.7220\">\"Category Theory using String Diagrams\"</a> (in Cat instead of Prof).  I guess also an advantage of double categories over bicategories is to track which things are functors and profunctors. I was more focused on monoidal bicategories and getting that into a decent form, but it is true that a lot of people around me is using monoidal double categories.</p>",

Is it that you are elaborating on the example of optics using their notation?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Let me be first totally clear that the answer is \"not much\" if the interest is on the monoidal bicategories themselves (for that I am using these references) instead of the application. The goal of the paper is not to create another tool but to apply the existing tool of the graphical calculus of monoidal bicategories to a problem (the proposal of pointed profunctors is what I am using to present this differently).  The rest of the answer is longer:</p>\n<p>The problem is not as much <em>optics</em> but all other <em>\"combs\"</em>, <em>\"input-output machines\"</em> and <em>diagrams-with-holes-like</em> things (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04732\">causality</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qny8YmLUzk\">games</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03671\">learners</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1051/ita:2002009\">categories with feedback</a>, there was even a discussion on zulip recently on how to try to approach these things <a href=\"#narrow/stream/229156-practice.3A-applied.20ct/topic/input-output.20machines\">(link)</a>). I think the contribution of this paper is to make the distance from <em>\"this would be almost a diagram in a monoidal category but it is not and it is difficult to reason graphically about it\"</em> to <em>\"I could use monoidal bicategories and there this would be totally formal\"</em> smaller for an audience that, like me, was in principle not even thinking of being working with monoidal bicategories; and does not necessarily know any of the prerequisites for quantum field theory.   So, I want to make clear that the goal (or the claim) was <em>not</em> to develop the graphical calculus of monoidal bicategories, internal diagrams for quantum, or to provide anything new on that (instead, I just send the reader to the previous work there).</p>\n<p>Having said this, I only identified <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.06811.pdf\">[BDSPV]</a> and added the references to all of this after I had written most of the text. This is partly why the presentation of the same idea in this text is this different. In particular, they say:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We do not need to, and do not, make this notion of an ‘interior morphism’ geometrically precise; the equalities (46–49) provide the foundation and formalism for the internal string diagram calculations, and the pictures (50) are merely a convenient graphical mnemonic notation. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.06811.pdf\">[BDSPV, §4.2]</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We already had a convenient notation for open diagrams (e.g. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00738\">Riley, on optics</a>), but I also wanted to have a category in which they were a particular case of the calculus of monoidal bicategories. This is why I take the time to explain the monoidal bicategory of pointed profunctors and my notation is different, instead of just taking it from BDSPV. What I may be providing in addition to BDSPV is the proposal of using <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msup><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">P</mi><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">r</mi><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">o</mi><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">f</mi></mrow><mo>∗</mo></msup></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathbf{Prof}^\\ast</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.773036em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathbf\">P</span><span class=\"mord mathbf\">r</span><span class=\"mord mathbf\">o</span><span class=\"mord mathbf\" style=\"margin-right:0.10903em;\">f</span></span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.773036em;\"><span style=\"top:-3.1473400000000002em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mbin mtight\">∗</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> to reduce the justification of internal diagrams to the justification of calculi for monoidal bicategories. This seemed important for my application; it is a minor comment that seems to be missing on BDSPV and that, to the best of my limited knowledge, seems to justify the calculus even better than \"a convenient mnemonic notation\". This is why I use <em>diagrams in the monoidal bicategory of pointed profunctors</em> instead of <em>internal diagrams</em>. But again, this minor change is not the goal of the paper.</p>\n<p>On notation: this may be psychological but, if I imagine the wires inside 3d bubbles, I think I can braid them (maybe it is just me, but isn't a braided category precisely that <a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/periodic+table\">(?)</a>). However, I remember to understand the goal on BDSPV is also general monoidal categories, I guess BDSPV would go on that concern by still using the same notation if the categories they deal with are not braided. I preferred to stick to a functor-box-like notation partly because of this and uniformity.</p>\n<p>The shorter version for ACT does not make all of this discussion; it just makes everything fit as a particular case of the calculus of monoidal bicategories (Schommer-Pries, Bartlett, Vicary, Douglas; the references for this are still the same). This was because I just do not feel confident that I completely follow how they address those concerns; and I wanted to use the calculus of some monoidal bicategory. The 2nd arxiv'd version of my paper (no page limits, yay!) takes longer but does this discussion. It not only references the rest of the work by Bartlett, Douglas, Schommer-Pries and Vicary but specifically <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.06811.pdf\">[BDSPV]</a> as the same idea of inflating diagrams. I actually found it via <a href=\"http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/files/11696/project.pdf\">Nick's Hu thesis</a>, also referenced there. On retrospective, and after having received feedback, I think this discussion deserves to be also on the short version more prominently to make the readers also follow the link to quantum field theory.</p>",
