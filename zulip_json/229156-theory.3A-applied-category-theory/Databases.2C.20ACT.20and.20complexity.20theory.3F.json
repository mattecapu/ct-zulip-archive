        "content": "<p>I'm working on complexity theory for databases, which is what led me to ACT: I'm trying to see whether category theory can say something interesting about my problems.<br>\nThere is a notion of dynamic complexity formulated by Immermann and Patnaik. Essentially, for a relational database that is subject to change, auxiliary relations are maintained in another database over the same domain with the intention to help answering a query.  When an update to the database (for simplicity, an insertion or deletion of a tuple) occurs, every auxiliary relation is updated through a first-order query that can refer to the database as well as to the auxiliary relations. The typical example is maintaining an st- graph (say, representing users of a social network who follow and unfollow one another over time) and trying to answer the query \"is t reachable from s\"?</p>\n<p>The class of all queries maintainable in this way with first-order update formulas, is called Dyn-FO.<br>\nThe actual formalization can be a bit finicky: see e.g. the introductory sections of <a href=\"https://informatik-rub.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SchwentickZ2016-siglog.pdf\">this</a> survey for one approach.<br>\nI believe this complexity class may admit a good categorical interpretation, and this would allow questions like the inexpressibility of certain problems within this class to be formulated and perhaps answered via sheaf theory and such, but I don't yet see how to carry this out. Am I barking up the wrong tree?</p>",

The need to check functoriality abounds in computational category theory; if people write what they think is a functor, that needs to be check to actually be a functor; not all assignments of objects to objects and morphisms to morphisms that people can write down actually define functors.   But this functoriality check is undecidable, because categories can represent so many kinds of algebraic structure.  Hence, CQL uses a theorem prover to tackle this undecidable problem as best it can</p>",

So every category input into CQL has an associated decision procedure constructed for it (which fails sometimes dues to undecidability, but not usually on real world examples)</p>",
