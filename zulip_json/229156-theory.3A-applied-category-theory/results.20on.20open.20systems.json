        "content": "<p>Hello folks,<br>\nIn the past year I've been thinking a lot about the emerging paradigm of 'open systems' in ACT. Examples from the recent literature are open networks (Baez, Pollard, Fong, etc), open games (Hedges, Ghani, Di Lavore, etc), open dynamical systems (Spivak Myers), open Petri nets (Baez, Master). <em>[Pardon me if I didn't list you or your work, I just wrote down the first things popped out in my mind. Please, feel free to point out additional examples!]</em>.<br>\nI find this concept potentially revolutionary: while scientific modelling has been, from the beginning, reductionist, the open paradigm encourages the investigator to explicitly acknowledge context in their models. This might be of secondary value in hard sciences like physics, or chemistry, but potentially life-changing for softer sciences like biology, medicine, economy.<br>\nHowever, this view might be too optimistic.<br>\nThe incredible organizing power of ACT in engineering, is, I think, now a matter of fact, even if applications in the wild might be not widespread. But can we claim ACT has given new and true insight on the behaviour of interconnected systems? E.g. impossibility results, optimizations, predictions/explanations of observed phenomena.<br>\nI believe this question is intimately tied with <a class=\"stream-topic\" data-stream-id=\"229156\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/229156-applied-category-theory/topic/measuring.20non-compositionality\">#applied category theory &gt; measuring non-compositionality</a>, since emerging behaviour is arguably the most interesting aspect of large scale complex systems. Finally, a very open question: what are some interesting questions we should try to answer?</p>",

        "content": "<p>As you point out, for systems that are genuinely complicated your functors end up being Lax, hence measuring quality/quantity of emerging behavior is difficult. I'd like to use some of the thing you point out to illustrate how emerging behavior has different connotations in different systems.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On one hand, consider the cospan formalism for Petri nets. As we were discussing in <a class=\"stream-topic\" data-stream-id=\"229156\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/229156-applied-category-theory/topic/measuring.20non-compositionality\">#applied category theory &gt; measuring non-compositionality</a> , here the functor giving you the reachability relation is lax. This is because, when glueing nets, you may create loops that weren't there before, making reachability way more complicated.</li>\n<li>On the other hand, you have categorical quantum mechanics (CQM). Here there's a lot of emergin behavior (think about entangled states, non locality, etc): Nearly everything is more than the sum of its parts. Nevertheless, this emerging behavior is completely accounted for in the model itself, so it can be fully described and manipulated. In this sense, I think the real difference is that CQM is describing quantum phenomena almost completely, while our paradigms for Petri nets are still missing something fundamental.</li>\n</ul>",

        "content": "<p>I thought about this heavily in the last year or so, and came to the following, empirically-motivated conclusion: Most often than not, when you have lax functors in your model, it means that you are missing something, or leaving something that may end up being important out. Sometimes this is unavoidable, either because we don't know what we are modelling deep enough, or because we don't have access to such information in the general setting. A similar argument holds for monads. One of the uses of monads is to encapsulate emerging/side effects, only exposing parts of them so that they become tractable. Again this is legit in most applications, but could have drawbacks later on. Hence, I try to employ lax functors and monads as little as I can when I'm modelling something new, and tend to resort to them as a last resource. Does this make sense?</p>",

I claim that open games \"correctly\" capture inherent non-locality in the application domain in exactly the same sense that CQM does - in this case, Nash equilibria are highly \"nonlocal\" between players. Despite that, it is very hard to take the next step and exploit this to do useful things that practitioners want - in contrast to CQM, which has the big advantage of strong logical metatheorems about ZX. And (handwaving) it's quite plausible that exploiting compositionality to do what we want in economics is impossible, because it would contradict existing results in complexity theory</p>",
