After my doctorate from UIUC and a stint at MIT Lincoln Lab, I switched careers to finance back in 2005 and have been there since.</p>\n<p>I've maintained a math finance blog since 2007: <a href=\"https://phorgyphynance.wordpress.com/\">Phorgy Phynance</a>. The \"Ph\" is a homage to my days in physics and linking physics to finance <span aria-label=\"nerd\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f913\" role=\"img\" title=\"nerd\">:nerd:</span> </p>\n<p>The \"no arbitrage\" principle as a commuting diagram is not new. Physicists have been tinkering with finance for decades. No arbitrage is occassionally presented as parallel transport so that lack of arbitrage is related to \"curvature\", i.e. nontrivial parallel transport around a loop. Taking this seriously has led to an entire field of \"gauge theory of finance\" <span aria-label=\"sweat smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f605\" role=\"img\" title=\"sweat smile\">:sweat_smile:</span> </p>\n<p>Some fun things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Nobel prize winning Black-Scholes equation is essentially the heat equation.
