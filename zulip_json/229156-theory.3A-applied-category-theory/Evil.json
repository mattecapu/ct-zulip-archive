One reason people here talk about its risks a lot is that a community of mathematicians who were used to thinking of their work as pure mathematics is suddenly having to grapple with ethical issues that applied mathematicians have been thinking about for years.  </p>\n<p>For example, homotopy type theorists in the US have gotten some million- and multimillion-dollar grants from the Defense Department.  The Topos Institute is so far largely funded by the US military and a few tech billionaires.  The quantum computing company Quantinuum is getting millions of dollars of investments and hiring some category theorists, and recently a venture capitalist put in tens of millions of dollars to start an AI company (Symbolica) that is also hiring category theorists.  And a number of category theorists are working on software for modeling in public health.</p>\n<p>All this is rather new.  So it's natural that category theorists - who traditionally tended to earn their living in academia - are busy discussing these developments, with very mixed attitudes about how to respond.</p>",

For example the machinery of open stock-flow diagrams that you developed for epidemiology can almost have applications in operations research, which is (modulo a bit of historical revisionism) what stock-flow diagrams were originally invented for. My standard go-to example of this is control theory, which is useful for such applications as steering ballistic missiles and steering a centrally planned economy</p>",

But it turned out to be essential to have good collaborators to make progress on such complicated projects, and I didn't find collaborators who 1) know how to use category theory in software, 2) want to work with me, and 3) are working on climate change.</p>\n<p>Luckily I found collaborators who 1) know how to use category theory in software, 2) want to work with me, and 3) want to develop category-based modeling tools for epidemiology and public health.   We're developing those  modeling tools now.    Once we have those, especially <em>agent-based</em> modeling tools, it will be easier to attract collaborators who want to apply them to climate change - and luckily, some of my current collaborators want to move in that direction.   In fact there's a substantial overlap between climate change and public health modeling, so we'll probably start by working in that overlap region.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>applied category theorists have to ask themselves if i.e. helping to save the world population from a pandemic via their software contributions is worth the additional greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's true that we have to ask ourselves this, but I think the answer is \"yes\".</p>\n<p>By the way, our software is not mainly aimed at \"pandemics\".   Epidemiologists study many causes of death and disease, including smoking, diabetes, drug abuse, heart disease etc.</p>\n<p>I don't actually believe that letting people die prematurely from disease reduces carbon emissions in the long run - even if it were ethical to approach the problem that way.</p>",

Or more specifically, certainly applied category theory is a boon for individual reasoning, but <em>mostly</em> because it allows one to better understand what other people are saying in a variety of domains. And it's harder to coordinate a large group of people for evil than it is to coordinate a large group of people for good. So, unlike other mathematical advances (like classical physics for cannonball aiming), it's a tool which is easier to use for good than evil. That is, you can have a single military which figures out how to aim cannonballs better, and then they can use that for evil. Similarly, certainly individual scientific breakthroughs that come from applied category theory can be used for evil. But the overall value proposition of applied category theory (that it makes collaboration easier) is not as easily used for evil as for good.</p>",
