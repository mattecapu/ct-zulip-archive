The last questioner was Morad Behandish, and he subsequently sent me a copy of Enzo Tonti’s book The Mathematical Structure of Classical and Relativistic Physics, which I’m currently perusing. You can learn more here:</p>\n<p>• Wikipedia, Tonti diagram.</p>\n<p>• Algebraic formulation of physical fields.</p>\n<p>I’m not ready to say anything about this work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Have you developed thoughts on Tonti Diagrams in the intervening years?</p>",
