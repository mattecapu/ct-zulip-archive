My Background in Physics is very poor.(Almost zero). But still I am very much enthusiastic about  learning how to apply 2-group gauge theory in condensed matter physics.  Though I do not know How and Where tho begin with!!  <br>\n   Sir , I have seen in your paper <em>An invitation to higher gauge theory</em> you mentioned that  there is some relation between Higher Gauge theory(Higher Parallel Transports) and Quantum Gravity. So it would be really great  if you kindly suggest  some literatures on both <strong>connection between condensed matter physics and 2-group Gauge theories</strong> and <strong>connection between Higher Gauge theory  and Quantum Gravity</strong>. I am highly interested in understanding and later working on both the topics.</p>",

I felt I have to learn a quite a lot of stuff before contributing something to the field. But it seems the journey will be exciting. I am also excited to know about your two papers on the subject. So can you please share the links of those two?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sure, they are <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01139\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01139</a> and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.6938\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.6938</a>. The first paper does a lot of higher dimensional non-abelian calculus and provides a lattice picture for the surface-ordered exponential. The second paper (written earlier) proves some theorems on gauge invariance/covariance for surface holonomy and computes some examples. <br>\nI should also mention Saikat Chatterjee and Amitabha Lahiri, who are both currently in India. Saikat is a mathematician who knows a lot about higher categorical structures in general (latest paper: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.00375.pdf\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.00375.pdf</a>) and Amitabha is a physicist who knows a lot about GR and field theory.  If you happen to live near either of them, I would definitely be in contact with them. I'm curious, are you learning these things on your own or do you have an advisor who works in the field?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thank you very much for the references.. What a coincidence!! I am pursuing my PhD under the supervision of  Saikat Chatterjee only!!</p>",

I'm not really paying much attention to this subject.    I think Arthur been paying attention more recently.  Here's what he said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is a TON of higher gauge theory being done in condensed matter at the moment. I noticed <span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"275920\">John Baez</span> already mentioned several authors such as Apoorv Tiwari. There are also papers by Ryan Thorngren, Anton Kapustin, and Sergei Gukov for example. You might also want to take a look at some of Dan Freed and Greg Moore's work in condensed matter (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.5055\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.5055</a> is quite influential, and even understanding the appendix will get you very far into the mathematical aspects of topological condensed matter theory). These are more mathematically-minded writers. From a high energy physicist's perspective, check out <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.5148.pdf\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.5148.pdf</a> and people who cite this work. For more condensed matter focus, I'd say it's paramount you learn the Levin--Wen model pretty well (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0404617\">https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0404617</a>), which is a foundational paper in topological condensed matter. The old papers of Kohmoto (<a href=\"http://physics.gu.se/~tfkhj/Kohmoto.pdf\">http://physics.gu.se/~tfkhj/Kohmoto.pdf</a>) and and TKNN <a href=\"https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.49.405\">https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.49.405</a>. I also think it's important to have a solid foundation of the ordinary gauge theoretic aspects of condensed matter before trying to go for the \"higher\" gauge theoretic aspects. For example, the Berry phase is nothing but the holonomy along a subbundle of a trivial bundle, which is then equipped with the induced connection via projections. If any of those words seem unfamiliar, it's probably important to learn those as well (check out Barry Simon's paper on the subject). There's so much out there, I hope it's not overwhelming. (I actually also have two papers on the subject if you want to check them out btw. they're more on the introductory and mathematical side though...)</p>\n</blockquote>",
