And I think this bumps right up against Coecke--Fritz--Spekkens saying a \"resource theory\" is an SMC where we call the objects resources and the morphisms processes. It's often the case that it makes more sense to name a category after its morphisms rather than its objects, doubly so in ACT.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Funnily enough, I find that paper a bit strange because, having been brought up in the Bob Coecke School of Categories, I find \"SMC = resource theory\" to be almost a tautology</p>",
