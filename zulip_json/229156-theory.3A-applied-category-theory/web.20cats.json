We went for gitter initially as it had support for LaTex, and just because I could not be bothered to search all the different chat options available. Since so many people from Category Theory are here, would it make sense to move this to a stream here? What do you think?<br>\n(I am completely new to zulipchat btw.)</p>\n</blockquote>",

They use Scala's Path Dependent Types to encode a type abstraction of <a href=\"https://github.com/banana-rdf/banana-rdf/blob/series/0.8.x/rdf/shared/src/main/scala/org/w3/banana/RDF.scala\">RDF types</a>, so that one can then write RDF code independently of implementations (Jena, Rdf4J, JavaScript libs) without needing to wrap the Java objects in an extra layer. (see <a href=\"https://github.com/banana-rdf/banana-rdf/blob/series/0.8.x/rdf-test-suite/shared/src/main/scala/org/w3/banana/GraphTest.scala\">GraphTest.scala</a> for an example) So you can change between Jena and Sesame in one line of code, and also compile to JS. <br>\n(but that last part needs more work).</p>",

Perhaps there is a duality there.<br>\nIt reminds me of the duality in roles described in a couple of papers (I reference there) in the literature on dialogical logic between the person making a claim and the person trying to refute it.

Indeed a Literal in RDF presents itself as a pair of a String and a URI. So in  <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/n-triples/\">NTriple</a>, Turtle, NQuad or N3 notation a Literal is written as <code>\"...\"^^&lt;...&gt;</code> where the first hole is filled in with a Unicode character string and the second hole is filled in with a IRI (an International Resource Identifier - a generalization of URIs to Unicode themselves a generalization of the URLs we use every day). So one could represent it as a pair <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mtext>String</mtext><mo>×</mo><mtext>IRI</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\text{String} \\times \\text{IRI}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8777699999999999em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord text\"><span class=\"mord\">String</span></span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;\"></span><span class=\"mbin\">×</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord text\"><span class=\"mord\">IRI</span></span></span></span></span>. But really the types of strings that are legal depend on the IRI. So the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dateTime\">xsd:dateTime</a> IRI gives a result only for strings that have a certain format, e.g. \"2002-10-10T12:00:00+05:00\" . <br>\nSo if we take IRI's to be a type in the HoTT universe <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mtext>IRI</mtext><mo>:</mo><mi mathvariant=\"script\">U</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\text{IRI} : \\mathcal{U}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord text\"><span class=\"mord\">IRI</span></span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">:</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathcal\" style=\"margin-right:0.09931em;\">U</span></span></span></span></span>, then we also have a family of types <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mtext>Lit</mtext><mo>:</mo><mtext>IRI</mtext><mo>→</mo><mi mathvariant=\"script\">U</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\text{Lit}: \\text{IRI} \\to \\mathcal{U}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord text\"><span class=\"mord\">Lit</span></span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">:</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord text\"><span class=\"mord\">IRI</span></span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">→</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathcal\" style=\"margin-right:0.09931em;\">U</span></span></span></span></span> where we could think of the type selected by the first IRI to be a set of legal strings for that type. Those pairs could then be mapped to the correct type (eg, a DataTime type with its own identity criteria).  Doing this we would be able to match more precisely the intent of RDF Literals, and we would also end up with pairs <br>\n<span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>u</mi><mo separator=\"true\">,</mo><mi>s</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo><mo>:</mo><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>u</mi><mo>:</mo><mtext>IRI</mtext><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo><mo>∑</mo><mtext> </mtext><mi>L</mi><mi>i</mi><mi>t</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>u</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">(u,s): (u: \\text{IRI}) \\sum\\ Lit(u)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mopen\">(</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">u</span><span class=\"mpunct\">,</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.16666666666666666em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">s</span><span class=\"mclose\">)</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">:</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mopen\">(</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">u</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">:</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1.00001em;vertical-align:-0.25001em;\"></span><span class=\"mord text\"><span class=\"mord\">IRI</span></span><span class=\"mclose\">)</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.16666666666666666em;\"></span><span class=\"mop op-symbol small-op\" style=\"position:relative;top:-0.0000050000000000050004em;\">∑</span><span class=\"mspace\"> </span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.16666666666666666em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">L</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">i</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">t</span><span class=\"mopen\">(</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">u</span><span class=\"mclose\">)</span></span></span></span></p>\n<p>The other way to present these is the much less satisfactory way of defining Literals as subsets of  <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mtext>String</mtext><mo>×</mo><mtext>IRI</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\text{String} \\times \\text{IRI}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8777699999999999em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord text\"><span class=\"mord\">String</span></span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;\"></span><span class=\"mbin\">×</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord text\"><span class=\"mord\">IRI</span></span></span></span></span>.

This is true, but essentially unimplementable: there are no canonical pushouts, as computing them requires making choices of names. In theory, that's fine. In practice, that's doomed, as it means that when you get a new theory via a pushout, you don't actually have any concrete means to refer to what's in it.</p>\n<p>There are ways around that, and most systems that claim to be based on institution theory do some mighty horrible hacks to get there. </p>\n<p>And that's just the start. Many operations from institution theory are not computable. That means that you can define all sorts of things, but then you can't have any computer help to check your work. [This is why people doing programming languages and proof checkers insist on decidable type checking.]  Examples of further issues: 1) deleting an item from a theory, 2) saying that your theory denotes the initial model. Neither of these can be exhibited syntactically (in general).</p>\n<p>BTW, Rabe knows institution theory very well, has written papers about it, and is good friends with people whose main work is all in institution theory.

HoTT I think it would be fair to say subsumes quite a large space of logics. But just watching Andrei Bauer's series on Cubical HoTT implementations shows that there are few different cubical HoTT Proof Assistants built on different models already. Could it be that Modal HoTT would be a way to create morphisms  (ie translations) between these and other models? Would there be any logics of interest to Florian not covered by this? </p>\n<p>This would still leave the question of the interchange format between the Proof Assistants of course (which I think of as in the space of web technologies).</p>",

There may well be 2-morphisms between them. Mention of modal HoTT introduces the possibility of translation via adjunctions of 1-theories written in a HoTT 2-theory.  It's probably easier to choose a simpler modal 2-theory such as  modal propositional logic. We could specify a 1-theory here which would have a model whereby there are two Boolean algebras related by adjunction generating modalities. For instance, one could think of the possibility modality which sends a proposition, X, to the proposition, P -&gt;X, for a fixed P. This is to mediate between two inference spaces where one has the advantage of being able to use P.</p>",

These logics and tools are competing instead of collaborating, thus creating massive duplica- tion of work and unexploited synergies. Moreover, new logics are designed much faster than tool support can be developed, e.g., in the area of modal logic. This inefficient allocation of resources must be overcome for scaling up applications of logic in the future. [...] </p>\n<p>But these solutions have been developed separately, and each can only solve some aspects of the problem. Logical frameworks are too restrictive and ignore model theoretical aspects. Institutions are too abstract and lack proof theoretical tool support. And markup languages do not formalize the semantics of logics.</p>\n</blockquote>",

We don't have great tools (outside of the cases when we have conservativity results) to build logic translations. Institution theory takes them as given, and goes on from there. </p>\n<p>An analogy: it's like assuming that you have an elliptic curve of a particular rank, and then going on from there. The problem is, our methods for exhibiting actual curves of certain ranks are not good. So such results are only useful in theory, even though they are sometimes claimed to be useful in practice.</p>",

The article on the <a href=\"https://iep.utm.edu/insti-th/\">Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy</a> starts out like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Institution theory is a very general mathematical study of formal logical systems—with emphasis on semantics—that is not committed to any particular concrete logical system. This is based upon a mathematical definition for the informal notion of logical system, called institution, which includes both syntax and semantics as well as the relationship between them. Because of its very high level of abstraction, this definition accommodates not only well-established logical systems but also very unconventional ones; and moreover it has served and it may serve as a template for defining new ones.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That doesn't tell me what an institution is, just points in the general direction.</p>",

In <a href=\"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.157.9610&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\">his tutorial notes</a> he shows how the modal logic of \"saying that\" can be given an interpretation in classical logic and in constructive logic. (Indeed it is cited as a major piece of work in <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"276656\">@Valeria de Paiva</span>'s <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/4563971/On_an_Intuitionistic_Modal_Logic\">15 year retrospective paper on intuitionistic modal logic</a>. Abadi oddly enough  did not seem to be aware of the semantic web, as it solves the problem of importing names that he mentions at the end of his paper when discussing the prolog like language Binder). Anyway, this means that the question on the web we need to face is which version of the modal  of <code>saying that</code> fits with RDF.

As an application, we give semantics of modal proofs (a.k.a., programs) in categories of augmented simplicial sets and of topological spaces... </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It goes into great detail of what programs are and as I do not yet know about \"nerves\", it was a bit worried I was perhaps going down the wrong track, even if the S4 relation to Abadi's logic of saying-that was there. The 2020 paper is beautifully illustrated with many examples from the multi-agent epistemology literature, so that helped me understand what simplicial complexes were.</p>\n<p>Another 2020 article <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0370157320302489\">Networks beyond pairwise interactions: Structure and dynamics</a> which is also very nicely illustrated looks at the use of simplicial sets and hypergraphs in complexity studies in biological, social and technical systems (and I think argues that hypergraphs are more general...)</p>",

The quad structure just allows on name sayings of things, and so to relate an agent to things they said. So <code>AdminC1 says { Jim canread file1 }</code> relates AdminC1 to the one triple graph  { Jim canread file1 }. So here we are no longer linking nodes in a graph but a node to a whole graph. ( a bit like the top node in the four simplex connects to a whole triangle below it). Assume that on computer C1 the rule is that what AdminC1 says is true, and so on C1 we do have that Jim canread file1. But that rule is not true on another computer, where another admin rules. Then it may be that on C1 there are a number of users, and AdminC1 allows each user to set rules when restricted to a subset of the files on that computer space... That is the intuition behind Abadi's \"says\" logic.  I think it is modal because it relates not objects in a graph (thought of as description of the world), but an agent to a graph.</p>",

As a Semantic Web developer I am not sure if I have types or not (OWL gives a class hierarchy logic) and how those would map to Curry Howard. So I asked a question on Web Cats issues <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/web-cats/CG/-/issues/9\">Is OWL/RDF typed or untyped? Should it be?</a>. Evan Patterson's model in terms of bicategories of relations would show how they could be strongly typed (a future RDF perhaps?). Pat Hayes offers and argument against  and Eric Prud'hommeaux argues that Shapes do give us the important features of types (I need to look into that). One would need to carefully study the advantages of RDF as it is used, and see what the advantages of moving to a Curry Howard friendly typing system would be. (I think the place where stronger type reasoning would make most immediate sense  would be with the RDF datatypes (ints, dates, etc...). I wonder how you see this, as you have worked with Description Logics and are a firm believer in Curry Howard.</p>",

Description logics, on which <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/#Semantics\">OWL semantics</a>  is based makes the distinction between T-boxes where relations between types are described, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abox\">A-Boxes</a> which is where objects of the form <code>bob : Person</code> are placed. </p>\n<p>I guess the problem comes from it allowing us to have <code>bob : Person</code> and <code>bob : Agent</code>. </p>\n<p>But perhaps that should be <code>bob : Thing</code> and <code>Agent, Person : Set</code> and these get related via the <code>&lt;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type&gt;</code> (written with prefix notation in Turtle as <code>rdf:type</code> - the colon is a bit confusing there for type theorists). <code>rdf:type</code> is a relation (abbreviated <code>a </code> in Turtle as it used so often ) so that we really have 2 relations:  <code>bob a Person</code> and <code>bob a Agent</code> .

You can read about it--if interested-- in my Textual Inference Logic papers. More recently Dick Crouch and Katerina Kalouli have used the description logic EL with named graphs to describe our logic of sentence inference. you may like their version better, it's in <a href=\"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/S18-2013.pdf\">https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/S18-2013.pdf</a></p>",

As we get more info what from far away looked like some Agent (Robot? Deer or even Lion) we find out to be a Person, .... Each of these are types.

And it also explains why Akka is used by LinkedIn, PayPal, Tesla, and many other giants to do billions of transactions a day.  <br>\nThe Solid Web is perhaps Actors with a preference of messages being encoded as RDF Quads, giving us a logical notion of context that does not seem to be made explicit in the simple message passing (even if it is compatible with it).</p>",

RDF adds another mapping from names to things, in terms of which truth can then be defined, and since it does not have a unique naming assumption,  multiple names can map to the same object.  Multiple names mapping to the same object just seems to be another way to say that we are dealing with setoids. Ie the names can form equivalence classes. </p>\n<p>Does that make sense? I</p>",

Though eventually things do go a little sideways: the category Set is a topos, but Setoids is only a (really nice) pretopos. So presheaves and profunctors are not quite as magical and over-powered in this setting.</p>\n<p>That most things are built on set is largely an accident of classical education not showing people there's even a choice here.  A complete formalization of RDF done in an effective manner (i.e. things that ought to compute, do in fact compute) would tell. To really \"tell\", it would probably have to be done multiple times, in different settings, such as in Isabelle/HOL, cubical agda and 'plain' agda (for example).</p>\n<p>So setoids seem to be nice when you have all sorts of equivalence relations floating around, especially when you have multiple equivalences on the same underlying carrier.

Rather the way the semantic web is used should be a guide to answering that question.) <br>\nThe simplest example would be a URL that refers to a document say <code>https://nlab.org/Monad</code> and that is then later made to redirect to <code>https://nlab.org/monad</code>. Do they refer in the same way? It seems not quite, the path in space-time that a request for one takes is different from the second.</p>\n<p>The way this works is defined by <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616#section-10.3.2\">RFC 2616 Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1 §10.3.2 301 Moved Permanently</a>. <br>\nThe client makes a request on a resource <code>&lt;...Monad&gt;</code> and the server responds with a <code>301 Moved Permanently</code> answer which I think counts as a proof object that the first URL now refers to the same things as the second URL. </p>\n<p>Things get a bit more complicated for URLs that refer to objects-in-the-world, via descriptions found on the web, as for example with a <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/spec/identity/#overview\">WebID</a>. An individual could have two such WebIDs - one professional and one for work say, and the descriptions could be done in such a way that one can build a proof that the referents have to be the same. </p>\n<p>So yes, I think we do have witnesses to the equivalence of two terms, and one should not equate two terms unless one has such witnesses.

This leads  me to think that if one were to model this in HoTT, one would use the ≡ symbol here.</p>\n<p>Now to your point regarding context, I think that presupposes that RDF does not, or cannot have a notion of context, which I think is a widespread misunderstanding.

URIs in a linked dataset can be partitioned into the exported URIs for which the dataset is authoritative versus the imported URIs the dataset is linking against. This partitioning has an impact on integrity constraints, as a Closed World Assumption applies to the exported URIs, while a Open World Assumption applies to the imported URIs. We provide a definition of integrity constraint satisfaction in the presence of partitioning, and show that it leads to a formal interpretation of dependency graphs which describe the hyperlinking relations between datasets. We prove that datasets with integrity constraints form a <strong>symmetric monoidal category</strong>, from which the soundness of acyclic dependency graphs follows.</p>\n</blockquote>",

This has proven to be a very powerful and extensible model for publishing on the web and sharing documents by contextualized reference. Many features have been layered onto this: visually formatted pages, bookmarks, embedded javascript, breadcrumbs, cookies, already-viewed affordances, etc., but all these basically maintain the Web as a stateless entity when traversed and viewed. Even the semantic web emerged as a data extension of the Web with semantics introduced to describe entities and relations more precisely and in support of logical inference, yet the Web itself (http mechanics) doesn’t gain or utilize anything from these semantics,  and so we have limited means for its extension. Keeping http simple like this is  probably why the Web took off; it also limits its general potential and relies on third-parties for work-arounds, both open and closed.</p>\n<p>However, this graph model of the Web is not quite accurate, since in fact the Web changes and the way new links are introduced define critical mechanics of the Web not yet addressed explicitly by a graph model. More importantly, without the ability for users to view a web page (document) or navigate across the links, the Web as only a graph has virtually no value: it needs observers and actors to perform actions onto it.  If on the other hand the views, the various contexts of users, and current location of a browser are considered as part of the overall Web model, what emerges is an algebraic framework for the Web (including <strong>algebras</strong> and <strong>coalgebras</strong>).</p>",

This is where <strong>Comonads</strong> possibly come in: they handle structures of unknown size with possible (even multiple) contexts over different of its elements. <strong>Comonads</strong> (W) consist of 2 maps (aka natural transformations, since a <strong>comonad</strong> is more accurately defined as an <strong>endofunctor</strong>):</p>\n<p>A <strong>coproduct 𝛅</strong>: W(X) → W(X) × W(X) a kind of data copy &amp; branch, and a counit 𝛆: W(X) → X that extracts some specific (focused) content out.</p>",

This example extends to the rooted tree model on directed graphs <strong>G</strong>, whose vertices are all the paths starting from a root <strong>𝑥0</strong>, and are connected if they have a single edge between them in <strong>G</strong>. This notion of spaces of traversals really begins to suggest the link between the usage of the <strong>Web</strong> and <strong>Comonads</strong>.</p>\n<p>Other familiar example of <strong>Comonads</strong> are the <strong>Reader Comonad</strong> (its dual is  the <strong>Writer Monad</strong>), which takes a set <strong>X</strong> and adds (reads) extra data (<strong>A</strong>) onto it , and the <strong>Stream Comonad</strong>, which takes a <em>monoid</em> sequence like time <strong>T</strong> and adds sets of maps <strong>T → X</strong> for the various histories or trajectories of <strong>X</strong> (which are contravariant in T) . The <strong>coproduct 𝛅 </strong>duplicates the data or relative histories and passes it along, while the <strong>counit 𝛆</strong> forgets the rest of the data or the different histories and returns the value at the local context. This further characterizes a comonadic model of how web browsers work with the Web. (see Runar Bjarnason's blog example <a href=\"http://blog.higher-order.com/blog/2016/04/02/a-comonad-of-graph-decompositions/\">http://blog.higher-order.com/blog/2016/04/02/a-comonad-of-graph-decompositions/</a>)</p>\n<p>The <strong>Comonad</strong> of a graph can be visualized as a graph of graphs with different context views at each higher-level graph vertex. Going to a page involves selecting an index onto the Web and forming an element of its coproduct, namely the traversal; the browser request of the new page (http-get) at a site and its rendering of the http-response is the extraction (counit <strong>𝛆</strong>).  That’s all very abstract, but this lets us establish multiple forms of these principles for using with or even extending the current Web.</p>",

Both (all) sides of web stakeholders <em>view</em> pages and/or activity, and they use this info to make the next decision of action.</p>\n<p>It now occurs to me that the bigger picture of users + website creators probably should be modeled as a game(s). It’s already been shown that games and lenses have a deep association. We can initially classify these into <em>acceptable</em> games and <em>misuse</em> (true adversarial) games, that is, some are like search sites and productive community sites, while others are about misleading, misinformation, and extracting your funds without return of services. This is interesting from a philosophical point of view, but I wonder if it can help defining proper regulators and safety mechanisms into the system.</p>",

He went on to analyse how all of language works that way, as a game of truthfulness and trust.  That is the coordination view of games, and that works with the web too: create a URL - any URL - in a domain you possess, and put some content there, and from there on, as people link to it, it will become more anchored , gain a reputation, which will create a type for it if you want: a space of changes that allowably make others keep telling the truth as they link to it. Changes to that document are acceptable in so far as they don't make others liars where they previously were telling the truth.  This is known as meta-stability, a word D.K.Lewis uses 3 times in that book.</p>\n<p>Access Control as discussed <a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Convention/A46XG7q6eYAC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;printsec=frontcover\">on the security + ct thread here</a> on the other hand is more of an adversarial game where the client wants to prove that it is allowed access to a resource in a mode as sepecificed in the access control document. There the client needs to reason in terms of what the guard takes as facts and find the credential that will help convince it to give access. To do that it can use linked web resources, but clearly not every such resource. The guard will there tend to be a somewhat paranoid reasoner.</p>",

Starting from the Resource Description Framework (RDF) for knowledge graphs, more advanced constructs have been introduced through various syntax extensions to add reasoning capabilities to knowledge graphs. In this paper, we show how standardized semantic web technologies (RDF and its query language SPARQL) can be reproduced in a unified manner with dependent type theory. In addition to providing the basic functionalities of knowledge graphs, dependent types add expressiveness in encoding both entities and queries, explainability in answers to queries through witnesses, and compositionality and automation in the construction of witnesses. Using the Coq proof assistant, we demonstrate how to build and query dependently typed knowledge graphs as a proof of concept for future works in this direction.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Point Free notation is much liked in functional programming, and of course maps very nicely to diagram chasing in CT</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>An obvious syntactic difference between description logic and first-order logic is that the former is point-free while the latter is not. By “point-free” we mean that the concept and role constructors of description logic suppress all variables, free and bound. First-order logics without variables do exist—Tarksi, for example, studied such systems in his last major work [TG87]—but, outside of description logic, they are rare in research and in practice. In this respect, relational ologs are like description logic: both the textual and graphical syntaxes of relational ologs are point-free.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the same article Patterson points out that by moving to a distributive relational olog, that is adding false and disjunction to the syntax to have a distributive bicategory of relations, we end up with \"coherent logic\" a language equivalent to first order logic via Morleyization . First Order Logic appears as  𝜆P in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_cube\">Lambda Cube (wikipedia)</a>. So could it be that  𝜆P is the internal language of the distributive bicategories of relations?  (I am just learning about <a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/syntactic+category\">syntactic categories (nlab)</a> and the proof in Patterson's article builds on such categories, but I have not yet studied it in detail).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>",

I know it is build in Set, but I am interested in what the consequences would be if one thought of it as a co-constructive logic.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Could it be that RDF is dual to constructive languages? Where RDF is more in the empirical space where things can only be falsified, constructive languages are in the space of building mathematical truths that can only be constructed.<br>\nThe major use for RDF is as a language to describe the world, whereas languages such as Agda are designed to describe mathematical structures. Mathematical structures can be built by construction and only tested that way, but empirical statements take their meaning from the world. So, for example, it is famous that through most of human history, people knew what water was, but it was only recently that it was understood that Water = H20. The essential definition came after the use. Could it be that in that space strong typing is a lot less useful?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Any one know what happens in co-constructive logics in terms of say typing?</p>",
