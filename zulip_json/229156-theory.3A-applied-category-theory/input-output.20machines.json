        "content": "<p>Hi! An early version of this idea seems to come from the beautiful graphical language Mitchell Riley uses in \"Categories of optics\" (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00738\" title=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00738\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00738</a>). I also happen to have a preliminary note that may be relevant here (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06214\" title=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06214\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06214</a>).  I think a fair answer is that you can model these \"combs\" as tuples of functions quotiented by an equivalence relation, at least in many useful cases.  The nice thing is that the equivalence relation coincides with a coend and you can then apply Yoneda lemma to obtain nice concrete descriptions for these \"combs\".  For instance, monoidal lenses coincide with combs (Riley's paper, without that name), and you can show that the combs Kissinger and Uijlen use as notation to model the work of Chiribella, D'Ariano and Perinotti, in the very restricted case of compact closed categories, also coincide with this idea (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.1325\" title=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.1325\">https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.1325</a>).</p>\n<p>The approach with coends seems to extend nicely to other topologies. We can try the example you were proposing :) The idea is to treat every \"invisible wire\" as quotiented out by a coend. For instance, your second topology example could be an element of the following coend, with the two invisible wires being U and V:</p>\n<p>∃ U V . hom(X , U ⊗ V) × hom(A ⊗ U, B) × hom(C ⊗ V, D)</p>\n<p>So, for instance, in the cartesian case, we can prove using Yoneda that it reduces to a pair of morphisms:</p>\n<p>∃ U V . hom(X, U × V) × hom(A × U, B) × hom(C × V, D)<br>\n≅ (By the universal property of the product)<br>\n∃ U V . hom(X, U) × hom(X, V) × hom(A × U, B) × hom(C × V, D)<br>\n≅ (By Yoneda lemma!)<br>\nhom(A × X , B) × hom(C × X, D)</p>\n<p>In non-cartesian cases, you may use some properties of your category to get a similar description.</p>\n<p>So I think a nice way to go seems to be coends (at least, it should not be neglected). A very nice introduction to coend calculus has been written by Fosco Loregian; I really recommend the reading if you want to pursue this direction <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.02503.pdf\" title=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.02503.pdf\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.02503.pdf</a>. And I would be actually interested in any applications of these things! :)</p>\n<p>(edited: I made public some days ago a note on this approach that, among others, treats diagrams like these: <a href=\"http://compose.ioc.ee/git/mroman/coend-calculus-and-open-diagrams/raw/branch/master/opendiagrams.pdf\" title=\"http://compose.ioc.ee/git/mroman/coend-calculus-and-open-diagrams/raw/branch/master/opendiagrams.pdf\">http://compose.ioc.ee/git/mroman/coend-calculus-and-open-diagrams/raw/branch/master/opendiagrams.pdf</a>  But please mind that this is work in progress :) )</p>",
