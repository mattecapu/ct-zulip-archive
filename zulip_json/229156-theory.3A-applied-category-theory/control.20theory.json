Maybe the first ACT meeting?<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783540071426\">https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783540071426</a></p>\n<p>I haven't had a chance to look it over yet---Springer doesn't even provide the abstracts---but I've requested some of the articles through my library.</p>\n<p>Obviously the computation part kept growing, but as far as I can tell the control aspects lapsed until ~2005, when <a href=\"https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1183&amp;context=ese_papers\">Haghverdi, Tabuada &amp; Pappas</a> applied bisimulation to controlled dynamical systems. I found this referenced in <a href=\"http://ames.caltech.edu/A%20categorical%20theory.pdf\">Ames' 2006 thesis</a> on hybrid systems. Is anyone aware of work in this area during the intervening 30 years?</p>",
