The best papers will be excellent as articles, and also lead to compelling conference presentations.</p>\n<p>• You are encouraged to use the \"subreviewing\" functionality to delegate your reviews to other members of the community who you trust to complete the task diligently, perhaps such as postdocs or experienced PhD students you know well.</p>\n<p>• While reviews are expected to be reasonably comprehensive, it is recognized that we all have a limited amount of time, and reviewers may not have enough time to verify the correctness of complex proofs in full detail.</p>\n<p>• Beyond completion of reviews for your assigned papers, you are welcome to submit additional reviews for other papers not assigned to you.</p>\n<p>• For each paper assigned to you, after you have submitted your review, you will be able to see the other reviews that may already have been submitted. Please then use the discussion functionality underneath the reviews to discuss the paper with the other reviewers. You are welcome to get involved with discussions even for papers that have not been assigned to you. It's great to focus these discussions on papers with a divergence of review scores, in an attempt to reach a consensus. You are welcome to start engaging with these discussions immediately after submitting your review, although this phase will likely only get into full swing in early June.</p>\n<p>• You are free to update your review, and your chosen score, at any time after submitting the review. In particular, if your opinion changes following a discussion, updating your review is the best way to indicate that.</p>\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\nJamie (co-chair)</p>",

The same reasoning goes for \"homotopy theory\" and \"algebraic geometry\".</p>\n<p>I get that John has his own grievances with US professors not identifying themselves with CT, but there can also be grievances arising in people working in other areas of maths due to sentiments similar to that expressed in the <em>semantics</em> of Joe's comment. This will become especially important when ACT proves to be good at getting grants, because that would put ACT in a privileged position, compared to other areas of maths. I personally know group theorists who are already very dismissive of CT on technical grounds: I can only imagine what kind of bile may arise from professional jealousy.

This has (largely) been the effect of category theory on mathematics, to celebrated effect.</p>\n<p>Second is the related idea that category theory has the potential to make things <em>conceptually tractable</em>. Thanks in part to the rise of computing, the systems in our lives are tending towards complete incomprehensibility, to the detriment of most.
