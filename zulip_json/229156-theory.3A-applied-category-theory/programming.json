I am not experienced that much with OOP and getting confused when reading theory about classes and types, where they differ, where they similar, when they should be used etc. Even haskell types were less confusing to me than this</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I answered the following (it seems a good hypothesis):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One way to think of them is that they are the same.<br>\nAnother way, could be to think of classes as duals to types perhaps, in that classes are coalgebraic and types algebraic, or classes are codata types as opposed to data types. So classes in Java are specified by their interfaces, which can have multiple implementations. As long as those implementations agree on what is visible and what results they give when interacted with they are the same, or more precisely bisimilar. Look at the papers in the list <a href=\"https://web-cats.gitlab.io/Cats/Intro.html\">I cited above</a> by Bart Jacobs.</p>\n</blockquote>",
