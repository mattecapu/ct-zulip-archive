I hope to use the previous research to guide me in some direction for applying CT in my master's thesis next year!</p>",

        "content": "<p>There's been recent work proposing categories of optics as a language for describing \"cybernetic systems\". This describes the general theory: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06332\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06332</a> . The most developed examples are in game theory and machine learning, but the paper describes general systems with feedback/control. And I understand there's work going on to broaden the scope of the examples this is applied to.</p>\n<p>There was also a recent survey paper with more general examples of CT in machine learning that might be a useful reference: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07032\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07032</a></p>\n<p>There was a workshop earlier this year on category theory in robotics as well. I don't know much more about that, but it looks like there's some videos for the talks, or it might be worthwhile looking into the speakers' work: <a href=\"https://idsc.ethz.ch/research-frazzoli/workshops/compositional-robotics.html\">https://idsc.ethz.ch/research-frazzoli/workshops/compositional-robotics.html</a></p>",
