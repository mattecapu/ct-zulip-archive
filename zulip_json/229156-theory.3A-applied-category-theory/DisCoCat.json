So for instance you have the sentence \"Clowns Tell Jokes\". Now \"Clowns\" and \"Jokes\" are states, that is, vectors that live in vector spaces that you can build more or less easily by doing thesaurus extraction of whatnot. \"Tell\" is a verb, so it expects a noun on the left, a noun on the right (which you compose using caps) and spits out a state (hence a vector) in some other vector space,  which is the space where sentences live. Clearly one of the main problems there is that no one had a clue about how this space looked like, or how to build it. Another approach we pursued was a cognitive-oriented one, which is the one I used in my PhD thesis. That was conceptually satisfying, but without learning techniques it was basically impossible to build real-life spaces and do something more than toy models</p>",

The idea of describing verbs as \"applying things to nouns\" is nice because gets rid of this sentence space altogether and allows you to live only in the spaces you already have but I don't know if it works for any verb. About the functor, the first DisCoCat paper was great because there wasn't any functor, and relationships between grammar/semantics were done using products. So yes, it was a unique category but things were still neatly separated, somehow. I still think that a functor Semantics -&gt; Grammar is useful, not from the NLP point of view, but from a linguistic perspective. It is also a nice point to tackle a lot of problems in Applied Category Theory that pop up pretty much everywhere, but are more pronounced for language, such as the fact that categories are more or less bad to deal with exceptions.</p>",

The reason why you can't do this is because you can prove that the vector space you get is trivial (as Preller did). So we resort to generate this huge category with all the words in it. Then things clearly work, but I guess you lose the original purpose of the idea, that is, separating tags from semantics, and encoding the tagging system in the functor. Now tags, semantics and tagging systems are all more or less conflated in the free CCC you generate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm not sure if I understand this characterization of the free compact closed category. My understanding is that the words are still freely generated by grammatical types, the key difference between this category and a pregroup, is that the free compact closed category is not a preorder (meaning that there can be more than one morphism between pairs of objects).
