I think a very select few still do, because the language of their published material tends to be more polished than what is normal today.

Some people (this may include ESL speakers) may not even realise that saying \"obvious\" or \"trivial\" is now considered demeaning, for example, or even feel that they're fully justified in saying so because some proposition appears to be transparently true to them. If the journal then insists on those changes, things could escalate to the point where a complaint of the journal not being inclusive enough could, ironically, be justified.</p>",

I've met ESL speakers who don't care for writing more polished prose because they felt it wasn't necessary for them to write \"beautiful English\" to get their point across -- \"beautiful\" means, for them, an inferior quality better expressed by the word \"florid\". Point 5 feels like something that would also be rejected on the same grounds. Both of these requirements also demand more depth in the authors' knowledge, which could feel like a burden to some ESL speakers who're just starting out on their research career.</p>",

        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"276424\">@Rongmin Lu</span>, you make an excellent point that some of what I'm suggesting is far more difficult for certain individuals. Speaking only from personal experience, I received excellent grammatical suggestions/corrections to papers I have submitted to category theory journals that (I hope) have improved (and will continue to improve) my writing. If I can say something in a clearer way, I would like to strive towards achieving that. Yes, it's <em>easier</em> to not do that, but I think we should all be heading towards a direction of improvement, not just for others, but also for ourselves, at whatever level we are currently at. On the other side, I have also judiciously corrected drafts, where initially the writer was upset about the enormous number of corrections, but soon realized the importance of those corrections and was able to see how much better their writing flowed. But yes, I do see your point and one should not go overboard (which is why I used the word \"encourage\" as opposed to \"enforce\"). It might be helpful to also reassure writers that certain things are suggestions and would improve readability but would not prevent their work from being published (which should itself be based on the content).</p>",

I have also seen other options, which includes making video summaries of a paper (see for example <a href=\"https://youtu.be/wiadG3ywJIs\">Tai's video on her thesis</a> or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTjmLBzAdAA\">Timothy Nguyen's video on path integrals</a> ... btw, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"296293\">@John van de Wetering</span> might find this second video interesting since he's learning about QFT from a more mathematically rigorous POV), but this seems to take a lot of effort. In either way, I'm worried about what happens many years from now when this information is lost or difficult to find and only the article remains. Though perhaps this may be related to <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"277473\">@[Mod] Morgan Rogers</span>, who makes a good point that in the future, it is very likely that locating information will become even more efficient. For example, you can use google scholar to look up papers that cited a specific paper and then search all those papers for specific key words to see if they were used. Imagine how time consuming this would have been just a decade ago.</p>\n<div class=\"youtube-video message_inline_image\"><a data-id=\"wiadG3ywJIs\" href=\"https://youtu.be/wiadG3ywJIs\"><img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wiadG3ywJIs/default.jpg\"></a></div><div class=\"youtube-video message_inline_image\"><a data-id=\"QTjmLBzAdAA\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTjmLBzAdAA\"><img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QTjmLBzAdAA/default.jpg\"></a></div>",
