They've hosted talks from myself, topos folks, Microsoft folks, Apache folks, and many more.   I'm reaching out to ask if anyone wants to organize (meetup slang for 'own') these two groups; all that is required is a (paid) meetup subscription, as the community provides plenty of content.  We don't mind maintaining ownership as Conexus, but have long wanted to donate the groups to the community, so here I am!</p>",

It is a matter of who wants to pay meetup several hundred dollars a year to be the 'owner' of the group; basically, they just get the bill.  So independently of who owns the meetups, I would encourage people here to do as they suggest, and try to re-invigorate the groups, which should be doable in their current state (certainly I can make people organizers of the two CT groups, lmk).  Meetups can be online only, or in person; meetup is basically just providing the equivalent of a mailing list with a calendar to RSVP to.</p>",
