That writing is none of the business of this zulip, although people here may hold some strong opinions about what they are discussing. </p>\n<p>To get one thing out of the way: obviously we're <em>all</em> human beings. As a human being, as a <em>general rule</em> I don't want to be told how I should write. I for one wouldn't be an asshole and \"double down\" on calling person P \"him\" if P wants to be called \"they\". But if we're talking about a person in the abstract, then maybe it would go against my grain, as a human being, to feel compelled to use singular \"they\" at times when I'd rather not. (Leaving aside how I, Todd Trimble, actually feel about this -- this is only an example. In other words, I'm using \"I\" in a peculiar way.) How people write is a very personal thing and can be something deeply felt. </p>\n<p>Since actually \"in any professional space in which I have any kind of power (which mostly means applied category theory in practice) I will not accept this kind of gender-nonbinary-noninclusive behaviour\" does carry more than a whiff of laying down the law -- especially since the notion of <em>power</em> was invoked, I for one would want to get clear on what, then, is considered acceptable to powers that be. The aforementioned episode of Monica Cellio shows what can happen: she was asking whether use of pronouns is <em>compulsory</em> in situations where such use could be avoided (as is virtually always the case, for competent writers). For example, she noted that there may be situations, involving human beings whose first language is not English and who are not immersed in debates involving political correctness, where use of an ostensibly plural form could be genuinely confusing or unclear. And for making inquiries into what the newly emerging Stack Exchange policy was, precisely, she wound up being stripped of her position, and with damage to her reputation. The episode was quite hideous. </p>\n<p>Casting the discussion in terms of \"grammatical correctness [being] more important than who somebody is as a human being\" is putting it pretty tendentiously and in black-and-white terms, in my opinion. There are some nuances here. </p>\n<p>By the way, as a moderator myself (over at MathOverflow), I know it's not always an easy job -- and I've had accusations of being \"PC police\" flung in my direction <em>plenty</em> over the years. It's super-hard threading the needle, sometimes. I hope you don't mind weathering the storm <em>too</em> much.</p>",

I find it cleaner and more accurate to conceptualize gender as a one-dimensional interval than a collection of two points labelled \"he\" and \"she\" (although this interval model is far from perfect, and one could also argue that \"he\" and \"she\" could also be conceptualized differently). However, in this interval model for gender, it is then tricky to concisely refer to a point (or subinterval) on this interval in a concise and convenient way. The potentially lower degree of gender-specificity in \"they\" strikes me as a reasonable way to indicate the usage of this 1D model for gender. I'd prefer using \"their\" to \"he or she\" for a similar reason - in my mental model for gender \"he or she\" refers to a collection of two points, while \"their\" refers again to the use of a 1D object for modelling gender.<br>\nHopefully these thoughts are roughly on topic!</p>",

In this case, I think the 'accusation' of being exclusionary is a fairly accurate representation of the situation and Mike Shulman's actions.</p>\n<p>I think you make a great point about the necessity to avoid unfair blanket accusations. For example, I would argue that it was an unfair blanket accusation when Mike Shulman claimed that  \"there is a movement to replace the fact of biological sex with a socially constructed non-binary notion of gender\", a claim that had nothing to do with the PR in question, but served to blanket-paint people Mike disagrees with as ideologically driven. </p>\n<p>Since you are actively involved in the discussions both here and on github, is it fair that you're chastising Jules for stating a concrete, verifiable claim, while mentioning nothing to Mike for whom your comment is far more appropriate?</p>",

As I said, on some issues I identify as conservative and my opinion would be pretty much orthogonal to the opinions of many people here and in academia in general. Still, I do not think my opinions allow or justify me to behave inappropriately in a given context. I always strive to treat people as kindly as I possibly can and I really do my best to make everyone feel welcome. Yet, I have to ask: Is this enough? To me, it feels like the issue here is not necessarily behavioral. I've seen countless tweets and topics everywhere that could be summarized as \"you are not allowed to have a given opinion\". This feels very different from \"you are not allowed to behave in a way that makes other people feel excluded\", which I believe is what code of conducts try to fix. In a nutshell, living in the age of internet for a conservative person feels like a constant \"reductio ad Hitlerum\" where everything you say can be considered as arbitrarily close to fascism. The way you behave feels totally marginal. I do not think this is right for two reasons: First, it is a gross approximation of a person's beliefs. Second, the way you behave with other people doesn't seem to matter. What matters is if the opinions you have are deemed acceptable or not by the majority of the internet crowd.

You might remember that there were two HoTT authors with similarly bigoted opinions in the original github PR. But only one of them has been actively discussed after the PR closed down. </p>\n<p>I don't know if anyone here has seen Dan Grayson's twitter account before, but I tried to scroll down his timeline for over a year in order to find a single math tweet, and I couldn't. It was non-stop anti-trans rhetoric. And I'm not saying this to attack Dan, but instead to point out that if people really cared about opinions so much, then why isn't Dan getting as much backlash as Mike? </p>\n<p>As far as I can see, it's because Dan's opinions begin and end with his twitter feed. So they really are opinions, not actions. And the only time when his opinions spilled over into his professional life was when he made those comments on the PR, and we've seen how that went. </p>\n<p>And when this incident began it really seemed like Mike was in the same boat, just another academic with some unsavoury opinions. But as the thread progressed, it came out that he actually has a trans grad student, and the fact that she is trans has been a source of majour ongoing conflict between them. And that really re-contextualises everything that Mike said in that thread, whether it was about trans people making him uncomfortable, or Mike not wanting to change his language for people with 'abnormalities'.</p>\n<p>I myself did not know about Mike's grad student before her post, but it turned out that I have a few acquaintances in common with her (it's a small field after all). And it's not my place to share anything, but I get the impression that the situation is quite ugly, and there's a possibility that it might not be over any time soon. </p>\n<p>So the reason why people are still so angry with Mike, and have largely forgotten Dan, is that Mike is actually acting on his opinions in a way that is harmful to a person he has authority over. And the people angry with Mike aren't some faceless Twitter mob, but actual people in our field, mostly grad students. </p>\n<p>Personally, I am not trying to 'cancel' Mike, and I look forward to both him returning as a speaker when this situation gets resolved, and to reading his upcoming book. But if this situation gets worse, and his student drops out as a result of this conflict, then ... I have a strong feeling that a lot of people will not forgive Mike for his role in that.

One person asked how other people were dealing with gender-neutral language, that is much trickier to use in Portuguese than in English, and several people freaked out and started a transphobic rant together. I decided to attack one person in particular - a senior logician, called José Carlos Cifuentes, that apparently is very very important and very very respected in both Brazil and in the Spanish-speaking countries of Latin America... I say \"apparently\" because I've never read his papers. Anyway: I sent an e-mail to the mailing list in which I said that he was treating gender-neutral language as something that _had to be_ ridiculed; he was ignoring all the material that other people had shared about the discussion on gender-neutral language, that has been going on for several years, and treating it as something idiotic - and everyone who had been following these discussions could see clearly the patterns he was reproducing, his arrogance, and his blind spots... and I said that what was going to happen was that in all the future events of the community all the people in the newer generations would look at him not as a great logician but as \"oh no, here's that stupid old guy again\".</p>\n<p>Once he was attacked in this way the other transphobes stopped.</p>\n<p>I guess that many people both here and on github decided to focus on Mike by reasonings similar to the one that I had... people are discussing attitudes and behaviors that can be discussed both in abstract/generic cases and in particular cases; and in the moments in which they feel that it is better to discuss particular cases they think that it is better to discuss Mike, and treat Dan as something secondary - and as less interesting, and as a degenerate case.</p>",

        "content": "<p>One point that Mike <a href=\"https://github.com/HoTT/book/pull/1101#issuecomment-1065924234\">made</a> in the linked github discussion was:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>... I think when discussing a hypothethical indeterminate person it's standard to assume that person is normal in all ways that are irrelevant to the issue at hand.... It's sensible and polite to avoid unnecessarily calling attention to the disability of any particular person, but when discussing a generic indeterminate person, we wouldn't get anywhere if we had to phrase everything in ways that included all possible sorts of abnormalities that an arbitrary person might have.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This reminds me of a personal experience, so it's now story time. A few years ago there was a discussion group I participated in, generally on a weekly basis. One thing we did each week was some sort of icebreaker activity. One week, the premise of the activity was that everybody sat around and made eye contact with one another for an uncomfortably long time (the consensus ended up being that this was a weird activity and nobody wanted to do it again, but that's beside the point). The issue was that one member of the discussion group -- let's call her Alice -- was visually impaired (legally blind, I believe). In the course of introducing the activity, the facilitator -- let's call him Bob -- actually acknowledged this -- at one point turning to Alice and saying \"You probably won't be able to participate\". But the group went ahead with the activity regardless, with Alice sitting it out. I think she ended up leaving the room, and only after a time did somebody go check on her. For most of the participants, the rest of the evening proceeded as usual. (I'm missing a few details of how exactly this went down, because I was actually absent the week this occurred, and found out about it the next week when we spent our time discussing what had happened the previous week.)</p>\n<p>Alice was extremely distressed by the experience on a few counts. In an ideal world, when Bob realized the activity would exclude Alice, he would have cancelled the activity or substituted an alternative. In an ideal world, when Bob pointed out publicly that Alice wouldn't be able to participate, somebody else would have suggested that the activity be cancelled or substituted for. In an ideal world, when Alice left the room, everybody would have realized right away that she was likely upset, and would have interrupted the evening to support her. Alas, this was not an ideal world.</p>\n<p>The next week, as mentioned, we spent most of the evening discussing what had happened. It was a productive discussion, but there was a disconnect. Somehow, there was still a lack of empathy for Alice's experience. Some participants continued to stress points like the fact that they didn't end up enjoying the whole activity anyway. I think this kind of missed the point (and it reminds me of my own comments <a href=\"#narrow/stream/241990-general.3A-values/topic/gender.20inclusivity/near/278558959\">above</a> where I said that I don't like gendered pronouns anyway -- I think I missed the point there).  One point that Alice came back to a few times was that a central reason that the whole experience was so traumatizing was that she cared deeply about this community. Otherwise she might have brushed it all off, but because she was invested, it was a real gut punch to see the group not only exclude her, but then proceed to minimize her experience at every level, even as they sincerely tried to appreciate what had happened. It was not long after that I moved away and left behind this discussion group, but I think I have the impression that Alice may have ended up leaving the community altogether -- even though that was an outcome which nobody wanted.</p>\n<p>I believe the central reason for this empathy gap was that Alice was classified as \"abnormal\". It is indeed standard in many contexts to assume that others are \"normal\". I believe this standard state of affairs is often problematic. It can lead to precisely this sort of empathy gap.</p>\n<p>Bringing things back to the matter at hand, I think this story is pretty relevant. One thing that people participating in internet discussion forums and people writing books have in common is that they write for large audiences which can be difficult or impossible to visualize. I believe the readership of a book or an internet message board are <em>communities</em> which are relevantly analogous to the small in-person discussion group in my story. There are all sorts of people whom I might consider \"abnormal\" who might be part of such a community. I believe that we should strive to be inclusive of all these people in a way which is relevantly similar to the way my discussion group should have striven to include Alice.</p>",

But it does mean that you should be aware of the possibility that somebody might ask you to fill in some technical context, just as if they were in a physical room observing your discussion and wishing to follow in more detail. Just as in this case, there will be a balance to be struck between explaining some context to certain people while perhaps assuming such context with others -- and just as in the in-person scenario, there are various solutions if there's a big gap in background between different people in the room.

For example, we might debate in the abstract notions of pronouns, but I generally observe that even people who object in principle to the use of certain pronouns will find a way to be polite, even friendly, when they are actually in the physical presence of a person whose pronouns they might refuse to use in the abstract.
