        "content": "<p>My wife, an academic in the humanities, has long been shocked that math hasn't adopted double-anonymous peer review, where the referees aren't told the identity of the authors.  I tell her that it's usually easy to guess who wrote a paper - since most papers are on the arXiv - but she's not persuaded that this means we should simply give up.  In the current system in math, almost the <em>first thing</em> a referee sees is the author's name and institution.</p>\n<p>Anyway, the American Mathematical Society has decided to adopt double-anonymous peer review:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The AMS is pleased to announce the launch of double-anonymous peer review for Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society. Further rollout across all AMS journals is planned after the initial implementation is fine-tuned.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In double-anonymous peer review, both the authors and the referees of a journal article remain anonymous to each other. The motivation for this change is that the refereeâ€™s first impressions of a paper should not be dominated by its list of authors and their affiliations. Instead, double-anonymous refereeing focuses attention on the mathematics and lowers the likelihood of implicit bias, supporting inclusivity and diversity across mathematics.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Read more <a href=\"https://www.ams.org/news?news_id=6983\">here</a>.</p>",
