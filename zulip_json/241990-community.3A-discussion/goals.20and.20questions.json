So, I don't want applied category theory to merely help people do what they're already doing, faster and more efficiently than they already are.    That will just drive our civilization off the cliff faster than we're already going.   It's quite hard to figure out how to do applied math that creates positive change, but some of us are trying to figure it out.   I'm glad that two of my students - Brendan Fong and Nina Otter - have set up institutes that seek to do this (among other things).</p>",

It works both ways: category theorists are sometimes prejudiced against applying mathematics, because -they believe- the ideas that usually are needed in applied mathematics are simple and thus unattractive. On the other hand, applied mathematicians sometimes lack knowledge of category theory that is deep enough to really think categorically. This is excusable: the field is young, sometimes they themselves are young, and category theory is a disturbingly huge piece of knowledge it takes a lifetime to master properly.</p>\n<p>How to solve this? One should tell the first group of people that there is a lot to do in ACT using ideas and tools as complex as they want. One should teach category theoretic ideas to the second group of people <em>properly</em>, i.e. without <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_usum_Delphini\">oversimplifying</a> them.</p>\n<p>This is difficult, because on one side you have to fight prejudice (a notoriously hard task), and on the other you have to really know what you're talking about (an even harder task, especially when one is exposed to pressures of geological scale to publish, publish, publish). I consider myself part of the problem: I still know category theory superficially and naively, I see no way I can teach someone else to think categorically, and I feel pressured to apply it even when I don't understand it.

I have started studying it regularly in 2010 and never left it. </p>\n<p>At the times, there were <em>exactly zero people</em> in my bubble doing category theory that could have guided me, and with the passing of time I grew the feeling that the biggest mistake made by the first generation of category theorists was to avoid leaving a meaningful legacy. The stuff is there, buried in obscure work by Kelly. Brilliant category theorists of the first generation had few students (sometimes, close to none), they were not interested in teaching and in outreach, didn't care about their \"public image\"...</p>\n<p>This has done harm to the community, outside (because of spontaneous trait transference, the way category theory is perceived is a function of the way category <em>theorists</em> are perceived) and inside (it is difficult to find a mentor. It is difficult to find an advisor. It is difficult to find feedback while studying. It is difficult to learn things properly.

This means that learning some more math is helpful to do applied work using categories, as learning more math provides one with a larger collection of examples of how category theory is used.<br>\n-Starting very, very simple in attempts to apply category theory will likely be helpful. This will also help enable communication with mathematicians who don't know a lot about a given applied area of interest.<br>\n-You will not know as much category theory as people who have focused on studying category theory.

But of course, it becomes easier if social interaction is activated. Yesteryear, discussions with colleagues at Mathematisches Institut Oberwolfach or at tea time at IHES; nowadays, remote zoom interactions, conferences in particular, where you unexpectedly meet lots of spiritual cousins, from all walks of life, may help a lot. Recall that some people interested in category theory do not know John Baez or the Seven Sketches (thanks for recalling this reference, John!) or the topos institute, or Charles Ehresmann's work (also Andrée's nowadays) or Pierre Gabriel's work on Abelian Categories in the sixties...  Just getting some helpful pointers may trigger a quantum-leap in their random walk, either individual or collective. Then, sky is the limit...</p>",

I have a few takeaways and questions at the end.</p>\n<p>I'd like to share my own experience with question 1 (\"Category theory sounds exciting/useful, and I want to apply it to [X], which I have a background in. How can I get started?\"). I also would like to share the sequence of events that lead me to ask question 1.. Perhaps there are some aspects of my experience that can helpful as the community helps people answer question 1. in the future. It could also be that self-learning trajectories like this could be helpful to include in some \"help me get started with applied category theory\" resource.</p>\n<p>I decided to take engineering in my undergrad, because I thought it had the highest probability of leading to a job where I would get to use math. However, I realized there was a lot of exciting math that would never be covered in my engineering classes. I would often head to the library and try to find some math book that was both exciting and accessible, with limited success. The first thing I remember engaging with about category theory was \"Category Theory For Scientists\" by Spivak (<a href=\"https://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/CT4S.pdf\">https://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/CT4S.pdf</a>). This book was exciting to me because I finally felt I had found an interesting math book that didn't assume classes I'd never taken. Subsequently, I banged my head against Aluffi's \"Algebra: Chapter Zero\" for some time, but it was too hard for me at the time to do as self-study. Eventually, I decided that to understand exciting math books I had to first study some \"boring\" things. So, I worked through some of \"Understanding Analysis\" by Abbott and \"Introduction to Topology\" by Adams. In this way, I discovered that the way to make progress in learning math through self-study is to pick something easy enough and work lots of exercises. </p>\n<p>With this understanding, I wanted to return to category theory. I was inspired by John Baez's blog, and found the link to this Zulip there. By searching on this Zulip, I discovered \"Seven Sketches\" and decided it was probably a great place to start learning applied category theory. I worked through probably about 30% of it, and this was fun and exciting. At this point, I felt that I was not understanding the motivation behind some of the examples and constructions as clearly as I would like. In addition, the book didn't seem to be addressing the kind of application I was most interested in. As a result, I have switched my efforts to Riehl's \"Category Theory In Context\", enabled by the background I acquired from \"Seven Sketches\".</p>\n<p>Sometime after starting \"Seven Sketches\" is when I started asking question 1  (\"Category theory sounds exciting/useful, and I want to apply it to [X], which I have a background in. How can I get started?\"). In my case, [X] is medical imaging. Here's my answer so far:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Continue learning category theory (from \"Seven Sketches\" and \"Category Theory in Context\")</li>\n<li>Explain, vaguely, the area I would like to apply category theory to in the <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"229156\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/229156-practice.3A-applied-ct\">#practice: applied ct</a>  channel</li>\n<li>Share insights and thoughts on applying category theory to my area of interest in <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"229156\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/229156-practice.3A-applied-ct\">#practice: applied ct</a>, and learn from any resulting discussion</li>\n<li>Read a little on the history of my area of interest, and identify the earliest simplest examples</li>\n<li>As I continue to learn category theory from (1), try to connect the ideas I'm learning about to the simple examples of my area of interest discovered from (4). This generally also helps motivate (1).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Some takeaways from the above:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There were a few \"quantum-leaps\" in my process of working towards applying category theory, summarized as: starting with something easy enough, working a lot of problems, discovering this Zulip and \"Seven Sketches\"</li>\n<li>Perhaps more important than having access to a single learning resource is setting up a feedback cycle consisting of (1) learning theory and (2) connecting theory to the applied problem of interest. (1) encourages (2), which encourages (1).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How can we help people take the next \"quantum-leap\" in their journey of connecting with applied category theory community?</li>\n<li>How can we help people enter positive feedback loops, where connecting theory to an application creates interest in learning more theory, and learning more theory creates exciting new perspectives on connecting theory to application?</li>\n<li>Might it be possible to help people enter such a feedback loop, starting before they have read any of \"Seven Sketches\"?</li>\n</ul>",

The first few sections of <em>Category Theory in Context</em> have so far been excellent for helping me deepen my understanding of basic concepts.</li>\n</ol>",

So, we have a strategy for determining if objects are not isomorphic in some category: apply functors to other categories and see if the images of those objects are not isomorphic.</p>\n<p>We can now make a philosophical connection to imaging. Think of a functor as a \"blurring lens\" through which the world is perceived. Then, the world as viewed in the image of a functor may be simpler than the original \"sharp\" world with its full details, but by (1) it still allows us to make some analysis of objects in the source category. Further, there are a huge number of \"world view lenses\" (functors) to analyze data in this style. In fact, every object <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>c</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">c</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.4306em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">c</span></span></span></span> in a category <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"sans-serif\">C</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathsf{C}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6944em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathsf\">C</span></span></span></span> provides a functor - the one Riehl calls the functor \"represented by\" an object <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>c</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">c</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.4306em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">c</span></span></span></span>! Different kinds of objects will allow us to probe different kinds of properties by the functor they represent.</p>\n<p>This now gives a possible strategy for applying category theory to imaging.

For my money the categorical community has somewhat of a problem with its inability to turn a critical eye on the limitations and scope of category theory. I would like a community goal to be for us to constructively criticize each other as to the limitations and scope of category theory. For a lot of people we are considered zealots and there are contexts where it's hard for me to be taken seriously, people roll their eyes when I advocate a categorical approach. I believe there are ways to do this without making the community toxic, but scientific research is more than improv (i.e., \"yes, and -\") At some point people need to say to each other, for example, \"You haven't yet provided sufficient evidence that this perspective is worth the effort it will take to learn the jargon.\"<br>\nRay Brassier once criticized Nick Land and his school of research for taking an approach of \"everything is connected\" - </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yet if thinking is just connecting things, of course it’s exciting, like taking amphetamines.

We must distinguish here between the justification of maths from the point of view of practitioners and of wider society. Maths, and CT in particular, is self-justifying to many practitioners. We do it because we enjoy it, because the abstract questions are interesting in themselves. I'm sure that Christian is right, that children could also enjoy and appreciate CT for its own sake. This would get more people asking John's question 1, from above:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Category theory sounds exciting/useful, and I want to apply it to [X], which I have a background in. How can I get started?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I like math, and I've heard about category theory. Might it be useful to me for my applied context, [X]?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, it does nothing for people in the position of question 2; someone who is not merely taking a recreational interest in CT but who wants to know whether it can be of practical use to them. To someone not already interested in CT for its own sake, investing time in CT is only justified to the point that it can be applied in the intended context!</p>",

Despite over 50 years of developments on topos theory, including huge textbooks, there are only a handful of practitioners. Even in algebraic geometry, for which toposes were conceived in the first place, topos theory has struggled to stay fashionable because those working on it failed to develop the theory in directions which provided any clear benefit to practitioners in adjacent disciplines (and because Grothendieck fell out with his students, but I don't know enough about that to estimate its relative importance). The Algebraic Geometry course I took in my Masters talked mostly about sheaves without the word \"topos\" appearing even once, and the word \"category\" was used only reluctantly, even though it was fundamental to the material we were studying. Even in supposed applications of topos theory like the use of the topos of sheaves on the real numbers for temporal logic, most of the existing work has gone into making explicit what the most basic ingredients of topos theory represent in this context (and possibly employing those ingredients directly), which does little to justify anyone exploring the mountain of theory beyond the basics.</p>",

I haven't spent enough time thinking about this, but one thing about highly generalized technologies is that the people developing them can say \"it's not my fault what people do with my work: I can't predict what they'll do with it\".
