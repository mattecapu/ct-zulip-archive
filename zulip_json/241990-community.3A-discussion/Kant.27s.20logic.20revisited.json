The consensus view is that this aspect of the <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> is a failure because Kant’s logic is far too weak to bear such a weight. Here we show that the consensus view is mistaken and that Kant’s logic should be identified with geometric logic, a fragment of intuitionistic logic of great foundational significance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These days I do not have much time to read it, so I cannot make any assessment about it, but maybe someone in the community has a comment? I would be curious.</p>",
