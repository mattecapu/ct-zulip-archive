I haven't a car and I didn't even pass a driver's license for this reason. I could have become an engineer but I moved to mathematics and I thought that doing research in math would be an ethical occupation, in particular on the point of pollution. But I was completely wrong! I'm doing research at Ottawa for the end of my masters  but was in France before and I went to a conference at Calgary last time. I'm going to do 18 000 km in airplane on a period of 6 months. All my efforts go up in smoke. I'm very probably going to continue with a PhD in math here at Ottawa and I will have to share my work with other people. I think a lot to the way I'm going to do it. Should I adopt an aggressive behavior by refusing to fly to conferences and only talk in visioconference knowing that it would affect my career progression, even more knowing that I'm just a beginner? I think this is the most moral option. </p>\n<p>Definitely, people need to engage themselves and I'm very glad that John adopt this position. Being a mathematician and flying everywhere is being a very big polluter. No matter the beauty of the maths. That's the reality.

The word Anthropocene captures the idea that humanity is now the principal strength in the evolution of our planet. If all academics stopped from one day to the other flying to conferences, the impact on emissions by the intermediate of the flights they are not going to take would probably be close to zero. However in a situation where all academics would have stopped flying to conferences, I'm sure that the emissions produced by these academics and also by other people would have decreased, by other mechanisms. Why? Because the ideas and general behavior of these academics would have changed. If you are willing to stop flying to conferences, you will as well take care of your emissions of dioxide carbon by other sources. Secondly, as an academic you represent the intellectual elite. Your actions as a human being have much bigger consequences than the one of a poor Sudanese, as it appears by your very much higher emissions of carbon dioxide. You are richer, more educated, closer to people who take important decisions... Definitely, you are on the top of the pyramid in terms of capital, whether economic, symbolic, cultural or social (These ideas of capital have been developed by Bourdieu).</p>\n<p>I lose myself by trying to convince you that stopping flying to conferences as an academics either have more consequences or is correlated with more changes that you think. Maybe, I don't speak so much in a mathematical way and it doesn't help. Anyway.</p>\n<p>The question of academics whose research is harmful to the human environment is another one. We can act on different subjects at the same time. But the ones who fly to conferences are much more numerous as it is the majority.</p>",

During the pandemic when demand for flights plummeted, the usual flights were being run basically empty by the airlines to ensure that they kept their rights at each airport.

Or that we are not clever enough to avoid a tragedy-of-the-commons type of behaviour?<br>\n<em>Of course</em> if a sizable amount of people stops travelling airlines will reduce flights, eventually. <em>Of course</em> it's hard to coordinate on such a decision, but stopping flying as an habit will reduce demand ever so slightly and set an example.</p>",

Much of agricultural produce is made in order to be wasted (not only through inefficiency, but literally because various industries are subsidized in order to ensure their continued existence in various regions regardless of the year-to-year demand for their produce). So if, for instance, you discovered that (e.g.) soybean or corn production was very devastating to the environment and you succeeded to organize millions of people to stop eating soybean and corn products, this would nonetheless not change the amount that is produced. In essence the reason is that we do not have a \"production-for-use\" economy.</p>",
