Sometimes these are related to people working in dual categories, and the unifying perspective of CT is one that allows dualities to exist without reducing them or failing to distinguish each side. (see <a href=\"http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/bob.coecke/Yoshi.pdf\">Maruyama's thesis on duality</a>. Finding such translations can be very helpful. <br>\nI also find it very helpful to get an idea of where I should look for answers for something.</p>",

(Contrast other proofs.) You could easily explain it out loud to someone while walking in the park. The only point when you might be tempted to reach for pen and paper is the last step, calculating the constant of proportionality, but even that makes only a small demand on your powers of mental algebra.</li>\n<li>It solves the problem by moving to a higher level of generality — and getting the right level of generality, at that.</li>\n<li>The generalization wasn’t quite the most obvious one. Good generalization almost always begins by carefully preparing the ground. Here, this was the little observation that for events that occur at most once, expected value is the same as probability. A more obvious generalization would be to ask what the probability of crossing was for needles of arbitrary length.</li>\n<li>We see uniform behaviour across a class of objects (curved needles of arbitrary length). Under other circumstances this would be called functoriality or naturality.</li>\n<li>There is a piece of grit around which the pearl forms. You can never solve a specific problem by entirely general means: at some point, you have to make the link between the generalities and the specific situation that you started with. Here, the grit is the calculation of the constant 2/π2/\\pi, got by thinking about a circular needle. </li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I also have the impression that category theory isn't really about categories per se, it's rather a way of doing math, an aesthetic sensibility.</p>",

So at the very least it settles the discussions about which is best: they are a weird form of mirror image. Duality also does not identify both sides. Algebras and coalgebras have very different properties for example.  </p>\n<p>There is a whole philosophy of duality in this sense.
