Then the authors proceed to present some more \"shape categories\" such as \"globes/thetas\", \"oriented simplicies\", \"oriented cubes\", \"positive opetopes\", etc. all based on the corresponding constructions on \"regular directed complexes\", such as \"suspensions\", \"joins/cones\", \"tensor products/cylinders\"... and for a clearer proof that molecules/pasting-diagrams are closed under tensor products, the author introduces a notion of \"generalised pasting\" for gluing two molecules at a portion of their boundaries. Finally to prove that the tensor product and the join constructions defined on \"regular directed complexed\" are compatible with any corresponding constructions on ω-categories, the author will postpone until the end of the book, a review of such corresponding tensor product and join constructions on \"directed chain complexes\"...</p>\n<p>I have not read any \"proof\" in the author's book, I just skimmed through the introductions prefaces of each sections and validated some of the book's theorem statements against some prototypical low-dimensional visual examples of ω-categories diagrams. But it is noteworthy that the author managed to solve the hard task of finding a coherent set of definitions which allows for purely \"mechanical\" algebraic proofs of theorem statements (rather than relying on the \"implicit intuition\" of the (obviously-visually validated) prototypical examples)</p>\n<p>While I can concede that the author has solved this question (with concrete evidence such as the author's <code>rewalt</code> python software):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"what are the computer data structures to express ω-categories from the perspective of the computational-combinatorics?\" </li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is not apparent that the author has also solved this question:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"what are the computer data structures to express ω-categories from the perspective of the computational-logic (type theory)?\" </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even after skimming through the author's entire book, my overall analysis remains that the first benchmark for this question of \"computational-logic (type theory) for ω-categories\" is whether and how it it possible to express the \"staking of 2-cells along their bases\" (a.k.a \"generalized pasting\"):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cutt.cx/48RQ\">https://cutt.cx/48RQ</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/CFPoO2Ljv9jfcltYxqOLCCPD/omega-category_staking_Capture.PNG\">omega-category_staking_Capture.PNG</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/CFPoO2Ljv9jfcltYxqOLCCPD/omega-category_staking_Capture.PNG\" title=\"omega-category_staking_Capture.PNG\"><img data-original-content-type=\"image/png\" data-original-dimensions=\"937x274\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/21317/CFPoO2Ljv9jfcltYxqOLCCPD/omega-category_staking_Capture.PNG/840x560.webp\"></a></div><p>...
