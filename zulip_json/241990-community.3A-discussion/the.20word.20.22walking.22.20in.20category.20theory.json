Over time, \"X \" or \"Xian\" can turn into a tag for broader generalizations that grow from the original work. I don't think more descriptive names have the same flexibility: Abelian categories would never have been named commutative categories (indeed even symmetric monoidal categories, where commutative would be a better fit, are not called commutative), a more descriptive name for Frobenius automorphisms would have prevented the creation of Frobenioids, etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>First of all, there's no reason that non-personal names cannot be used this way. Second, it is worth reflecting whether this is even desirable. I tend to find these situations unhelpful, because it involves overloading terminology in ways that can be confusing when you first encounter them. Third, I agree that a more descriptive name for Frobenius automorphisms may have not suggested the term \"Frobenioid\", but the way you phrase this makes it sound like \"Frobenioid\" is the ideal term, and we would have missed out if some other terminology was used. But this just isn't true: there's nothing objectively useful about \"Frobenioid\" compared to some other evocative choice of terminology.</p>",

One can literally use any word to mean anything, and if enough people follow your lead, it becomes standard. But this reflects relatively little on how good the choice of the word was.

Sometimes I think mathematicians regard it as self-evident that eponyms are bad, when in fact there are arguments to be made for the other side.</p>\n<p>Personally, I think most of the arguments for eponyms can be effortlessly generalized to argue for any (mathematical) <em>neologisms</em>.  The point is, sometimes we really want a <em>new</em> name for something rather than to reuse some ones that already have meaning in mathematics.  When we introduce a new word that doesn't previously have a mathematical meaning (whether or not it is an existing word in some natural language), we are free to define it to mean one specific thing, without the danger of confusion with other meanings of that word.  And a new word can then also have its meaning expanded in turn over time to refer to other related things.  If we never introduced any new words into mathematics, eventually all the mathematical words would be as overloaded as, say, \"cartesian\" is now, and things would be more confusing.</p>\n<p>Naming things after a person is one way to get a new word into mathematics.  But we can also import existing words from natural languages, or create new words that didn't exist before in any language.  A couple such words that come to mind are \"topos\" and \"operad\".</p>",

I think I explained above why and how eponyms function more productively (in the linguistic sense) than the alternatives.</p>\n<p>If people had used the adjective \"commutative\" instead of \"Abelian\" in \"Abelian group\", we would not have later managed to create the term \"commutative category\" to stand in for what is now \"Abelian category\", because the connotations would not have matched. The same holds for _any_ other neologism based on properties of Abelian groups: if someone had coined \"rearrangeable group\" instead, we still could not have created \"rearrangeable category\", since rearrangeable would still carry the wrong connotations here. Had one gone by analogy with the integers, and called them \"Integral groups\", well, still wouldn't work.</p>\n<p>Nobody had any hidden insight about what will have made the category of Abelian groups look especially interesting, not back when the term \"Abelian group\" was first used. But the word Abelian stayed useful, and kept developing, precisely because it had no other strictly mathematical connotations attached to it and could freely take on the ones it needed.</p>\n<p>One could of course have coined a new term for Abelian categories, unrelated to Abelian groups, but it is useful to be reminded that the category of all abelian groups is an abelian category.</p>\n<p>The only other words with similar flexibility include very abstract adjectives, like \"ideal\", \"normal\", \"prime\" or \"simple\" (many of them are overloaded, and have their own serious problems), and other proper names with no prior associations. But if the choice comes down to a totally random / tenuously related adjective as neologism (\"brisk group\", compare this very thread, which is about an adjective that wasn't even random just fell flat for many people) or totally irrelevant proper name (\"Gaussian groups\") or metonymy (\"Danish groups\", see the tropical geometry controversy) vs. some name that's historically related (\"Abelian groups\"), well, the one that acknowledges some actual connection seems like a clear winner to me.</p>",
