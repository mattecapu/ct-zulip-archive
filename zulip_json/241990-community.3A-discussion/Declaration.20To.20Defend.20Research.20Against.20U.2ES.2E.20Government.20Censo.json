By signing, you commit to acting on at least one of these four recommendations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Support instances of resistance to U.S. government censorship.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Promote venues for scholars to share, safeguard, and preserve their work, beyond the reach of censorship.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Participate in efforts to track and record instances of U.S. government censorship.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Share this Declaration broadly and encourage individuals and organizations in your communities to sign and support it.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As part of your commitment to condemn and resist, consider using the <strong>#DefendResearch</strong> hashtag.</p>\n<p>Delayed resistance will only amplify censorship risks and cause irreparable harm.
