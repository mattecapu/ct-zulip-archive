I wanted to draw from the experience people here have had, and ask - what sorts of difficulties have people found from teaching category theory?</p>\n<p>My guess is that these fall into 2 general types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Difficulties with actually learning the concepts within the material. For example, understanding functors and natural transformations, dealing with the significant abstraction present, getting skilled at unfolding definitions quickly. \"How do I learn CT?\".</li>\n<li>Difficulties with motivation. For example, understanding why \"thinking categorically\" might be useful or appealing, finding problems which are either difficult or impossible without a categorical approach, and just generally justifying all the new language, terminology and diagrammatic reasoning. \"Why should I learn CT?\".</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, I'd also be interested in ways people have managed to successfully address these issues!</p>",

One can then ask what these are in each new category one encounters. </li>\n<li><strong>Functors: passing from one container to another --</strong>  It becomes natural to figure out which of the structures considered in point 1 are preserved by which functors, which leads one to consider statements such as the one that right (left) adjoints preserve (co)limits. </li>\n<li><strong>Categories as a theory --</strong> Here one starts constructing new categories and functors with properties one has by this point recognised as useful.

But we cannot compose any two functions, the domain of the second one has to be the codomain of the first one. The same happens with matrices and their multiplication. Think of other similar examples, for example from the following, if you are familiar with them: Markov kernels and their compositions, continuous functions, continuous curves in a space, relations, group homomorphisms. If you had to formalize the common pattern that all these follow, what structure would you define?</em></p>\n<p>When I ask this, most people come up themselves with the definition of a category.

Most students are happy to learn a + b = b + a and not 1 + 2 = 2 + 1, 2 + 3 = 3 + 2, etc. Similarly, I have found when I introduce point 1 above most students are happy to learn that quite technical and often unmotivated constructions like the free product of groups follow a general pattern. </p>\n<p>Once one has completed Step 1, one should be sufficiently motivated to proceed to Step 2 -- thus addressing your second point --  because one recognises the utility of being able to say things like <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>π</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>:</mo><msub><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">T</mi><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">o</mi><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">p</mi></mrow><mo>∗</mo></msub><mo>→</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">G</mi><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">r</mi><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">p</mi></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\pi_1: \\mathbf{Top}_* \\to \\mathbf{Grp}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.5806em;vertical-align:-0.15em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.03588em;\">π</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t vlist-t2\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.3011em;\"><span style=\"top:-2.55em;margin-left:-0.0359em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\">1</span></span></span></span><span class=\"vlist-s\">​</span></span><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.15em;\"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">:</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.9303em;vertical-align:-0.2441em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathbf\">Top</span></span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t vlist-t2\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.0816em;\"><span style=\"top:-2.4559em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mbin mtight\">∗</span></span></span></span><span class=\"vlist-s\">​</span></span><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.2441em;\"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">→</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8805em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathbf\">Grp</span></span></span></span></span> preserves finite coproducts. </p>\n<p>After this, in my experience, people either become hooked, and want to learn about AFTs, free cocompletions, Grothendieck constructions... or simply recognise the utility of categories in certain situations and move on to things they find more interesting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p>If I may,  Cantorian abstract sets may be thought of as containers, but categories as containers may be obscuring much of what categories are: qualitative turn (cf. categorical mistake is comparing qualitatively different apples and oranges; of course, as fruits we can compare apples and oranges to our hearts' content).  Also, given that our ordinary conscious experience is categorical (e.g., cats, cars, people, buildings, trees, sounds et al. are all perceived as objects of corresponding categories), category theory is a welcome ever-proper alignment of reason with experience.  Since every object of a category partakes in the essence(s) characteristic of the category, morphisms between objects are necessarily structure / essence-preserving.  It might be of some use to highlight that category is not a (French ;) structural turn; categories are geometric objectifcation of concepts abstracted from particulars, thereby serving as theories, functorial interpetations of theories, and as backgrounds for these models.  Encouraged by the fact that a listing of properties of functions with respect to composition readily leads to category theory, we can start with even more elementary place-value notation for numbers, which when displayed as functions with geometric domains (places) and algebraic codomains (values), and readily recognize categories (not to mention the <a href=\"https://lawverearchives.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2003-FoundationApplicationAxioEd.pdf\">self-foundation of domain geometry subsuming the algebra of codomain values as its subcategory</a>).  Unfortunately, functions in the then set theory didn't have codomains, while type theory didn't have domains; hence <a href=\"https://conceptualmathematics.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/categorieswhynotearlier.pdf\">the delayed discovery of categories</a>.  Also, functoriality, without discounting the indispensability of functors in going across limited universes of discourses / categories, seems to be about compatibility with composition.  It is also not without value to introduce category theory in terms of trending things: for example,  a morphism between models (in the background of sets) of a theory consisting of m component objects and n component structural maps consists of m functions satisfying n equations, which can inform why divide-and-rule works: with compounding identities as component structural maps, it's difficult to change the status quo of the society.  In closing, unlike physics, with its shortest path, math (category theory) appears to have a thing for crooked paths, possibly a reflection of its makers (cf. <a href=\"https://conceptualmathematics.substack.com/p/crooked-timber-of-mathematics\">Isaiah Berlin</a>).  P.S. [variable] algebra as an advance beyond [constant] arithmetic is understandably attractive, but even elementary arithmetic, say, <a href=\"https://lawverearchives.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1989.Milan_.categorytheoryinthefoundation.pdf\">17 + 8 = 25</a> is loaded with content and waiting for humanity to contemplate (not only problems, but also the solutions that work so wonderfully).

One can fruitfully do category theory only embracing <em>all three points of view</em> at the same time, i.e. thinking categories as (combinatorial) shapes, as foundational universes, and as mathematical structures of their own specific kind.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"282822\">@fosco</span>  the following, in light of the above, might be of some interest to you: <a href=\"https://conceptualmathematics.wordpress.com/2014/01/20/structure-and-natural-transformations/\">It is not correct to say that a given category C 'is' a category of structures, because there may be many such representations (a similar subtlety with the 'is' arises in linear algebra: it is not correct to say that a vector 'is' a list of numbers because a given vector space has many co-ordinatizations (isomorphisms with suitable R^n).</a>  Simplistically stated, it's not unlike writing a number n as more than one exponential (n = a^b = c^d = ..., albeit not in the case of all numbers).  Professor F. William Lawvere explicitly states (i'll look it up) that a category C can be represented as  B^T or D^V or ... depending on what is taken as a theory and what is taken as a background for interpreting the theory to obtain models of the theory.  On a not too unrelated note: Consider the pure math modeling in terms of diagrams in the  category of Cantorian abstract sets.  This structure is essentially the only expression of whatever \"inner essence\" the dots may have.  From that point of view, a category is  special case of truncated simplicial set, i.e. using finite totally sets as (contravariant) diagram schemes and as \"figure shapes\" in any given category.  Two of the maps between  3 and 2 correspond to the domain and codomain structure of any category, whereas one map from 2 to 3 corresponds to the composition operation in any  category.  Then the map from 2 to 1 corresponds to the \"inclusion\" from the set of objects to that of the maps.  This inclusion should be understood in the same spirit as any inclusion map in category theory.<br>\n<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"276422\">@David Michael Roberts</span> knows who ;)  There's more on this in <a href=\"https://conceptualmathematics.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/functorial-semantics.pdf\">Functorial Semantics of Algebraic Theories</a>, p. 12.</p>",

When I started teaching Conceptual Mathematics (CM), I requested Professor F. William Lawvere, along with many serious category theoreticians to be on the CM mailing list, along with the students, so that they can correct any mistakes I may make in my lecture notes I used to email a week in advance of my lecture.  All my questions and Professor F. William Lawvere et al. answers posted to the CM mailing list are archived at The Salk Institute (i'll see if i can find the website address / login et al).  I still vividly experience the gratitude I felt when many of the who's who of category theory answered <a href=\"https://conceptualmathematics.wordpress.com/2012/09/23/comfortable-with-shehes/\">my nagging questions</a> <a href=\"https://conceptualmathematics.wordpress.com/2012/06/14/sum/\">dating back to some 0.25 century</a> in a very helpful manner.  One of these days, if the religion of peace doesn't put life / humanity to rest in peace, I'll collect them all and organize and send it to Danilo Lawvere.  (I shared Professor F. William Lawvere &amp; Stephen Schanuel Objective Number Theory material I had, which will appear on the archives sometime soon given Danilo Lawvere's workload.)  I think the Lawvere family, especially Madam Fatima Lawvere, along with their grandchildren are already working very hard to make public all of Professor F. William Lawvere's unpublished work, the volume of which is beyond anyone's imagination if one only counts his published papers.<br>\nP.S.  Cambridge University Press (CUP) is very eager to publish a book on Professor F. William Lawvere's seminal insights and expansive visions (such as): <a href=\"https://conceptualmathematics.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/perugianotes.pdf\">a mathematical theory of the transformation of time and space into each other in a way more profound than that reflected in the notion of velocity</a>.  I don't remember what and when I wrote to CUP, if I did, but it looks like I have been marked on their mailing calender.  I think Gilbert Strang is heading the math unit at CUP, but I don't think he's into category theory (although I felt a kinship in reading him say in his zillionth edition Linear Algebra textbook: formulas have a place, but not the first place :)  If anyone of you are interested in working on CUP interest in Professor F. William Lawvere's brilliance, I'd be very happy!  (I'll try to find any emails i wrote to CUP and their invitations to submit a book proposal.)</p>",

I'll call this \"the example wall\". I haven't even taken the pure maths module yet (next year, if I pass this module)!  This is where I think APPLIED CT is really powerful. If you're talking about an adjunction, for example, what [insert non-math prior knowledge domain here] problem can motivate this construction? I'll talk a little more about the potential power of ACT later.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Concepts. I also have this problem, as evidenced by my (let bigons be, due to <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"275920\">@John Baez</span> )<a href=\"#narrow/channel/229199-learning.3A-questions/topic/How.20to.20learn.20about.20.22courbes.20immerg.C3.A9s.20dans.20une.20surface.22/with/568388778\">bigons question</a> (though that's not strictly CT, I've more examples). I'll call this a \"learner's gluing problem\" (does the concept exist already?): <br>\n(a) Is the concept I'm reading about in one book the same as what I'm reading about in another paper? <br>\n(b) What is the current state of the concept that this early author wrote about? <br>\n(c) Does this one word/phrase mean the same thing or different things for different authors? There are at least 3-4 flavors of <strong>Poly</strong> that mean different things -- what's the difference between them?<br>\n(d) This one has been really fun for me to learn: Symbols! Notation! Different authors use different glyphs for the same concept, and the same glyph for different concepts! In \"plug and chug\" math, the notational conventions are relatively standard, and so this was a huge thing I had to get my head around. It takes a lot of time to sort through. However, that \"sorting through things\" is precisely how I've been able to learn how to explore definitions, and is one of the strengths of what I call <em>adventure learning</em>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>But this problem (2)  is related to my next point. I would propose adding one more type and making that the second type.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Guidance. This comes embedded in the context of university, and why I wish there were an intro to CT at mine, at my level! Many of my problems with concepts come from not having access to a teacher/syllabus/direction on <strong>WHAT to learn</strong>. As mentioned, I am self-guided (I'm not a self-taught person! I'm trying to figure out my list of topics by anchoring them to things I already know and/or love. I'm definitely NOT self-learning because I'm learning from many of you here, asynchronously and without traditional classroom-type interaction), but I'm having to come up with my own syllabi (syllabuses?)? And my related difficulties have been:<br>\n(a) What is the corpus of \"basic\" category theory for people who want to apply it?<br>\n(b) What, formally, IS \"applied category theory\" anyway? <br>\n(c) How would you or anyone know whether I've applied category theory successfully?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As a note: After a long time, hard work and serendipity, I have found a tutor and he's amazing!! I've gone to him with a very specific topic, so the Guidance Problem still stands for me. I also owe him a HW problem set that I'm behind on :P </p>\n<p>So here is an idea, which I have from previous related experience in a different context, and where I come back to the power of <strong>A</strong>CT. The abstractness of CT makes it so that there's something for everyone! An idea might be that, before the course/module starts, maybe try to ask students </p>\n<ol>\n<li>What are specific things they like/ are curious about / have to learn about from any part of their life? (robots? the USS Enterprise? yin yoga? medieval castles? Jane Austen novels? Polish grammar? etc.)</li>\n<li>Within those topics, what are questions/challenges they have?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>From there, maybe pick a few that resonate with the most people (or if a small enough class, they can use their own examples), and then design specific motivation and then the list of examples around that.</p>\n<p>Has anyone tried or tested this in the CT context? Maybe the education community has studied the phenomenon of teaching specific things to learners of mixed prior knowledge. Maybe ask someone studying childhood education (I would say I'm probably around 4 or 5 years old in CT/mathematical maturity)?</p>\n<p>I've had loads more thoughts on the dual of your question (including how on earth to get credits for what I'm learning extra-curricularly -- some kind of network of university partnerships?), but I think this turned into quite a long message, so I'll stop there with the hopes that it helps someone who is teaching or writing CT textbooks :P</p>",

This is part of a general theme where, in category theory, you care <em>how</em> two things are equal, not just <em>that</em> they are equal. Representing linear maps by matrices then comes by \"conjugating\" the map with the basis isomorphism, and change of basis maps can be determined by drawing commutative diagrams involving the basis isomorphisms.</p>\n<p>On a related note, I always found it a little difficult to wrap my head around active vs passive transformations, which is crucial for Noether's theorem (where symmetries correspond to conserved quantities). It helped when I realised that it's best to think of such symmetries as mapping <em>functions</em> to <em>functions</em> - given a single solution (which might be a function from time to space, so a trajectory), you act on it by a group element to get another solution, so another function. That's where being familiar with currying and uncurrying can help, i.e. the natural isomorphism <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mtext>Hom</mtext><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo separator=\"true\">,</mo><mi>B</mi><mo>→</mo><mi>C</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo><mo>≅</mo><mtext>Hom</mtext><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo>×</mo><mi>B</mi><mo separator=\"true\">,</mo><mi>C</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\text{Hom}(A, B \\to C) \\cong \\text{Hom}(A \\times B, C)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord text\"><span class=\"mord\">Hom</span></span><span class=\"mopen\">(</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">A</span><span class=\"mpunct\">,</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.1667em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.05017em;\">B</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">→</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.07153em;\">C</span><span class=\"mclose\">)</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">≅</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord text\"><span class=\"mord\">Hom</span></span><span class=\"mopen\">(</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">A</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222em;\"></span><span class=\"mbin\">×</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.05017em;\">B</span><span class=\"mpunct\">,</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.1667em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.07153em;\">C</span><span class=\"mclose\">)</span></span></span></span>.

It lines up with how I've become less interested in finding a \"Grand Unified Theory\" as I've done more physics, especially within condensed matter where you use multiple perspectives all the time!</p>\n<p>But of course, you have to apply this to the categorical perspective, too. There's no axiom of math which says the categorical way of thinking is the \"One True Perspective\" on all of math; and to me that's a feature, not a bug! I don't imagine category theory would've been much help in discovering the Einstein tile, for example, but that's one of my favourite recent mathematical discoveries.
