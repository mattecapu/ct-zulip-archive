Here are its 'thoughts':</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Here's a thinking process that could lead to the explanation of Quillen homology of a monoid:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Understand the Goal:</strong> The request is to summarize the idea of Quillen homology of a monoid. This means focusing on the motivation, construction, and significance, rather than getting bogged down in extreme technical details (like simplicial sets unless necessary). The target audience is likely someone with some background in algebra or topology, but not necessarily an expert in homological algebra or category theory.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Identify the Core Concept:</strong> Quillen homology is a type of homology theory. What does homology do? It measures \"holes\" or algebraic invariants. It often arises from chain complexes. It's usually defined for algebraic structures (groups, rings, modules, algebras) or topological spaces.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Connect to the Object:</strong> The object is a monoid. What's a monoid? It's like a group, but without the requirement of inverses (associative binary operation, identity element). Examples: (ℕ, +), (strings, concatenation), endomorphism monoids.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Motivation: Why Homology for Monoids?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Generalization:</strong> Group homology (Eilenberg-MacLane homology) is well-established. Monoids are generalizations of groups. Can we generalize group homology to monoids?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Algebraic K-theory:</strong> Quillen's original motivation was algebraic K-theory. He defined K-groups K_i(R) for a ring R using the classifying space BGL(R). The fundamental group π₁(BGL(R)) is related to K₁(R), and the homology groups H_n(BGL(R), ℤ) are related to K_n(R) via the Hurewicz map. The group GL(R) = ∪_n GL_n(R) is built from matrices. Can we relate this to simpler algebraic structures? Quillen homology provides tools to compute homology of related algebraic structures, including groups and potentially monoids arising in K-theory contexts (though the direct link for monoids themselves in K-theory is perhaps less direct than for groups or categories).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Understanding Monoid Structure:</strong> Just like group homology reveals information about group structure (extensions, relations, etc.), monoid homology should reveal information about monoid structure.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>How is it Constructed? (The Quillen Way)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Key Idea: Simplicial Resolution.</strong> Quillen's approach often involves constructing a resolution of the object in a suitable category, often using simplicial objects.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Bar Construction Analogy:</strong> Recall group homology. It can be computed using the bar resolution. This is a standard simplicial resolution of ℤ by free G-modules. Can we adapt this?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Category Theory Perspective:</strong> Quillen often worked with model categories and derived functors. Homology theories are often derived functors of abelianization or similar functors.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Quillen's Specific Construction (for algebras/rings initially, adapted for monoids):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Associate a simplicial set (or simplicial object in some category) to the monoid M. A standard choice is the nerve of the monoid, viewed as a one-object category. Let's call this category C(M). The nerve N(C(M)) is a simplicial set.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Alternatively, and more directly related to the \"bar construction\" idea: Construct a simplicial resolution of the monoid itself within a suitable category (e.g., simplicial monoids).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The André-Quillen Homology Connection:</strong> Quillen homology for commutative rings is closely related to André-Quillen homology, which measures deviations from smoothness/freeness using cotangent complexes. This suggests the idea of \"resolving\" the structure.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Simpler Approach (Derived Functor):</strong> Define a functor from monoids to abelian groups (e.g., abelianization, but that's too simple for higher homology). Consider the functor that takes a monoid M to a module (e.g., ℤ, or a general M-bimodule). Homology is often the derived functor of Tor or Ext.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The \"Standard\" Construction for Monoids (Adapting Bar):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Consider the category of M-sets (sets with a left M-action).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We want to derive the functor M ↦ ℤ ⊗_{M} ℤ (where ℤ has trivial M-action). This is analogous to H_n(G, ℤ) = Tor_n^ℤ<a href=\"http://ℤ,%20ℤ\">G</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To compute this derived functor (Tor), we need a projective resolution of ℤ in the category of M-sets or, more typically, M-modules (if M acts on abelian groups).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bar Resolution Adaptation:</strong> Construct a simplicial object (often a simplicial abelian group or module) B_*(M).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>B_n(M) is typically the free abelian group generated by (n+1)-tuples (m_0, ..., m_n) where m_i ∈ M. Or perhaps n-tuples (m_1, ..., m_n)? Let's check the standard bar construction for groups: B_n(G) = ℤ[G^{n+1}] with faces/degeneracies based on multiplication. For monoids, it's similar: the free ℤ-module generated by M^{n+1}.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Define face maps d_i: B_n(M) → B_{n-1}(M).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>d_i(m_0, ..., m_n) = (m_0, ..., m_i m_{i+1}, ..., m_n) for 0 ≤ i &lt; n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>d_n(m_0, ..., m_n) = (m_0, ..., m_{n-1}) &lt;-- Wait, this is for the two-sided bar construction B(A, M, B). Need the one for H_n(M, ℤ).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Let's use the standard normalized bar resolution for H_n(M, A) where A is a left M-module. The complex C_n(M, A) is A ⊗_{ℤ[M]} P_n, where P_n is a projective resolution of ℤ as a trivial M-module.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The standard resolution P_* uses P_n = ℤ[M^{n+1}] with M acting on the first factor: m • (m_0, ..., m_n) = (m m_0, ..., m_n). The differential ∂: P_n -&gt; P_{n-1} is ∑ (-1)^i d_i, where d_i drops the i-th element: d_i(m_0, ..., m_n) = (m_0, ..., ^m_i, ..., m_n).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Then H_n(M, A) = H_n(A ⊗_{ℤ[M]} P_*). For A = ℤ (trivial action), we tensor with ℤ over ℤ[M]. This essentially kills the first factor action.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>ℤ ⊗_{ℤ[M]} P_n ≈ ℤ[M^n] generated by [m_1|...|m_n]. The differential becomes the standard bar differential:<br>\n  ∂[m_1|...|m_n] = m_1 • [m_2|...|m_n] + ∑ (-1)^i [m_1|...|m_i m_{i+1}|...|m_n] + (-1)^n [m_1|...|m_{n-1]].<br>\n  If the action on ℤ is trivial, m_1 • [m_2|...|m_n] becomes just [m_2|...|m_n].</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This looks exactly like the standard definition of group homology!</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Is there something different for Quillen homology?</strong> The standard bar construction defines Eilenberg-MacLane homology. Quillen homology often refers to the homology derived from simplicial resolutions in a more abstract setting, particularly for non-additive categories or algebraic theories.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Connecting to Quillen's K-theory:</strong> Quillen defined higher K-theory using the plus construction on BGL(R) or using the Q-construction on exact categories. These involve constructing specific spaces/simplicial sets whose homology/homotopy groups give K-theory.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Revisiting André-Quillen Homology:</strong> This is defined for commutative algebras S over a ring R. It measures the non-exactness of S ⊗_R - applied to a simplicial free R-algebra resolution of S. It uses the cotangent complex.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Quillen Homology for Algebraic Theories:</strong> Quillen also defined homology for objects in categories defined by algebraic theories (like groups, rings, Lie algebras, monoids). Let T be the theory for monoids. One considers simplicial T-algebras (simplicial monoids). The homology H_n(M) can be defined as the homotopy groups of the abelianization of a simplicial free resolution of M.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Let F_* -&gt; M be a resolution of M by simplicially free monoids.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Apply the abelianization functor (-)&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt;: Monoid -&gt; AbGroup. M&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt; = M / [M, M] (if M were a group). For a monoid, it's often M / ~ where m n ~ n m. More accurately, it's the target of the universal map to an abelian group. Let's denote it Ab(M).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Compute the homotopy groups π_n(Ab(F_*)). These are the Quillen homology groups Q_n(M).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>H_1(M) = Q_1(M) = M&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt; (for groups). For monoids, Q_1(M) is the standard abelianization.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>H_2(M) relates to presentations (Hopf's formula for groups).

This isn't a resolution by modules, but a simplicial monoid F_* which is \"freely\" generated in some sense (technically, cofibrant in a model category structure on simplicial monoids) and maps to M (viewed as a constant simplicial monoid) via a weak equivalence (roughly, inducing isomorphisms on homotopy groups π₀, π₁...).

This means focusing on the motivation, construction, and significance, rather than getting bogged down in extreme technical details (like simplicial sets unless necessary). The target audience is likely someone with some background in algebra or topology, but not necessarily an expert in homological algebra or category theory.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Someday I may repeat my request adding that I know a fair amount of homological algebra and enjoy category theory, and see how this changes its \"thoughts\".</p>",

Training AIs takes a lot of energy so I suppose you could be concerned about second-order effects of using them encouraging more training, although I personally think the third-order effect of \"there's no way to possibly build all these data centers without building an awful lot of new renewable energy plants\" plausibly dominates that anyway.</p>",

In both cases, almost all of the energy cost is \"in the past\" and part of \"training\", rather than \"thinking\", which makes it harder to say which is more efficient - if for example more people can re-use the LLM training than the training of a human mind, perhaps LLMs become more efficient, when amortized.</p>",
