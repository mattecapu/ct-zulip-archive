However, I believe true inclusion means using tools like AI to help non-native speakers participate directly in the main conversation. To me, it feels more productive to use technology to bridge the gap here in the primary channel rather than moving to separate, language-specific spaces.</p>",

They produce fluent text even when their translation is inaccurate, which doesn't give either party any clue about what is being lost in translation.</p>",
