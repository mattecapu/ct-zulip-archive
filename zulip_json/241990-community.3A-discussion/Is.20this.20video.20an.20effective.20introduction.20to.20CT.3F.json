I've seen some pretty good examples, such as the sensible introduction to CT by Oliver Lugg and videos by Eyesomorphic (who also explained lambda calculus recently in a way I could actually almost understand!). However, yesterday I came across the following video by Di Beo's which I didn't find as helpful as those other ones: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKixqJ9xnRM\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKixqJ9xnRM</a><br>\nThe presentation seemed disjointed (such as introducing the property of identity and associativity twice within a few minutes), some of the visuals seemed misleading (I think they could mislead someone into thinking an individual mapping of one set element to another was a \"morphism\" in Set), and I think they missed the point of Lawvere theories entirely. But since I'm still learning the subject in the beginning stages, I wanted to come on here and ask others what they thought of the video. Am I right to not find this video helpful, or is it just teaching the subject in a different way to how I learned it?</p>\n<div class=\"youtube-video message_inline_image\"><a data-id=\"mKixqJ9xnRM\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKixqJ9xnRM\"><img src=\"https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/03d94199f6dc3190a41796f0015287f866b704a2/68747470733a2f2f692e7974696d672e636f6d2f76692f6d4b6978714a39786e524d2f64656661756c742e6a7067\"></a></div>",
