He brings up five distinct interesting points about racism (perfectionism, obvious to you/amazing to others, educating yourself, tone policing, and white centering). </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Trevor Noah: George Floyd, Minneapolis Protests, Ahmaud Arbery &amp; Amy Cooper (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/v4amCfVbA_c\">https://youtu.be/v4amCfVbA_c</a>)<br>\nThis video has been out for almost a week, but on the off-chance you haven't seen it, I would highly recommend. Trevor talks about the history of systemic racism in the US, and helped me understand how centuries of oppression against Black Americans manifests in the current day. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Hasan Minhaj: We Cannot Stay Silent About George Floyd (<a href=\"https://youtu.be/i_FE78X-qdY\">https://youtu.be/i_FE78X-qdY</a>)<br>\nHasan is born to immigrant parents from India, and he brings that angle into the discussion.

There's no cost to tune in, but donations are encouraged. </p>\n<p>Here's a blurb for the show: <br>\n\"A liberal white couple open the doors of their renovated Harlem brownstone to host a cocktail party for a Black Lives Matter activist, his gay white lover, a sistah named Shemeka and the mother of a slain 12 year-old black boy. A night of cocktails and conversation spark emotional debates ranging from under-weight polar bears, Lana Turner, saving the planet, gentrification, racial identity and protecting the lives of black boys.\"</p>\n<p>The link for ticket reservations is here: <a href=\"https://playground-sf.org/Juneteenth/?fbclid=IwAR2vcdZvDX4hqLBE8bh3mIhud88rLF8KbapWL5P2W6bF73l8b3Qmo1hAF0I\">https://playground-sf.org/Juneteenth/?fbclid=IwAR2vcdZvDX4hqLBE8bh3mIhud88rLF8KbapWL5P2W6bF73l8b3Qmo1hAF0I</a></p>\n<p>More information: <a href=\"https://playground-sf.org/Juneteenth/?fbclid=IwAR2vcdZvDX4hqLBE8bh3mIhud88rLF8KbapWL5P2W6bF73l8b3Qmo1hAF0I\">https://playground-sf.org/Juneteenth/?fbclid=IwAR2vcdZvDX4hqLBE8bh3mIhud88rLF8KbapWL5P2W6bF73l8b3Qmo1hAF0I</a></p>\n<p>I personally haven't seen the show yet, but my friends who have have all given glowing reviews; I think this would be a great opportunity to learn more about the BLM movement and related topics, as well as support the Black theatre community (if you have the monetary means to do so).</p>",
