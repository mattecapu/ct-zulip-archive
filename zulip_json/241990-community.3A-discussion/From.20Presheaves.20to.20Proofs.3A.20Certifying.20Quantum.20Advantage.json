My focus is on contextuality: presheaves already capture the tension between local coherence (consistent distributions within commuting sets of observables) and global impossibility (no single assignment works for all contexts).</p>\n<p>What I want to explore is how to go beyond descriptive power, towards <strong>formal certification of quantum advantage</strong>. The idea is to develop <strong>computable cohomological invariants</strong> within a topos-theoretic framework, which could act as <em>certificates</em> of contextuality and be directly testable in simulations and quantum learning experiments (e.g., Q-learners).</p>\n<p>In short: can we frame “quantum learning advantage” not just as an empirical observation, but as something we can <em>prove</em> and <em>verify</em> through categorical and cohomological methods?</p>\n<p>What do you think? Any suggestions, references, or directions you would recommend?</p>",
