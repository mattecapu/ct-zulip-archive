It's somewhat incidental that mainstream psychology has come to retroactively validate some of their claims, at the time that the foundation was created there was not sufficient evidence; they effected the change in narrative by lobbying.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thanks, this was helpful (should've went there directly).

I guess what initially caused my confusion was that, while they were perhaps right to attack earlier ideas around repressed memories that can be recovered e.g. in hypnosis,  the \"false memory syndrome\" peddled by the foundation is also quite dubious. Anyway, it's messed up to start a lobby foundation to fight against private accusations, especially when the apparent blanket policy was to believe and support anyone who has been claimed an abuser.</p>",

I just don't know what else to call it.  </p>\n<p>In case anyone cares, Teichmüller space is the space of  all Riemann surfaces of a given genus, modulo the action of the connected component of the diffeomorphism group.

This gives the \"moduli space of Riemann surfaces\" of the given genus, which is extremely interesting, but a lot more complicated.   Also, the moduli space actually wants to be a stack, since some Riemann surfaces have symmetries.  But none of these symmetries are in the connected component of the diffeomorphism group when the genus is &gt; 1, so Teichmüller space doesn't want to be stacky except in genus 0 and 1.</p>\n<p>By the way, this seems like something that homotopy type theorists would have fun formalizing.  At least ones who like differential geometry, like Urs Schreiber or David Jaz Myers.   </p>\n<p>Anyway, none of this brings to mind a good alternative for the name \"Teichmüller space\", but someone should come up with one.
