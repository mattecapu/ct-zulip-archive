I share this not just because he did so as a member of a lab I belong to (though this fact does make me a little proud) but because this symbolic act follows several decades of activism on his part that his open letter (in French) describes.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, early this morning the <a href=\"https://freedomflotilla.org/fr/la-flotille-pour-la-liberation-de-gaza/\">Freedom Flotilla</a>, carrying  12  peaceful international activists and aid to Gaza, was intercepted in international waters by the Israeli military.

Every single time I did I've ben accused of either not backing the Palestinian cause enough, and hence of being a fascist, or of being sympathetic with a bunch of terrorists, hence being a terrorist myself. All this, pretty much always, happened with a lot of insults and shouting in the process. It really degenerates very quickly. So yes, call me a coward or whatever but I consciously decide not to engage in this type of conversations with the people I work with.

It is absolutely true that Netanyahu is using this Iran situation - and also the Gaza situation btw - to distract the public opinion from his own problems. Before all this stuff started in 2023 his political career was failing and he was to stand accusation of corruption and other crimes, so yes, all this has been a total political blessing for him and he's propping it up. This is something that even many people agreeing with Israel on the Gaza situation openly recognize. Yet, this doesn't mean that the hate between Iran and Israel isn't completely genuine, and the idea that the two countries - or their leaders thereof - could willingly 'do each other a favor' really means not understanding a thing about how geopolitics - and anthropology itself, actually - works</p>",

There are many possible scenarios here but the most interesting ones to play with are the ones where Iran is badly defeated (e.g. total collapse of regime followed by western-friendly/puppet government). Should this happen, all cards are on the table. If there's even a speckle of a provable hint by the United States to Israel things will become exponentially worse, if there isn't it is likely someone will work hard to fabricate one. In any case, Russia is already very overstretched and it was actually counting on Iranian drones for the Ukrainian campaign, so I wouldn't expect too much from them in the immediate. On the other end, China is a completely different game. They already declared in the past that an USA attack on Iran would prompt them to declare war on the USA, for instance. In any case, the MENA map could get redrawn by pulling countries such as UAE much closer to Russia and China than they are now (I don't know how much this is likely tbh), but most importantly, this may be the kind of situation that emboldens China enough to try something on Taiwan.</p>",

One may even argue that Israel, as a state, was created with this purpose in mind (in my opinion the story of giving this and that to the holocaust survivors etc is a nice front but really not something with any meaning if you are a geopolitical realist).</p>\n<p>The second is that esp in the US there are many people in positions of power that are very supportive of the Zionist cause for ideological and/or ethnic reasons.</p>\n<p>As we all know it happened many times already that Israel did something that was very hard to back up/not condemn for everyone in the west, yet support was never withdrawn precisely because of the reasons above. I don't know how much pressuring MPs to push for cutting ties would work. If they're ideologically aligned with Israel there is no hope. If they are realist enough they could put Raison d'Etat before the humanitarian crisis in any case.</p>\n<p>In any case, if the cutting off is purely diplomatic I don't know how much Israel will care. They don't seem to be giving many Fs about how the world perceives them atm to be honest with you.</p>\n<p><strong>Case 2: Cutting military and diplomatic ties</strong></p>\n<p>This is interesting. Until recently, everyone used to believe that Israel without US support couldn't do anything militarily meaningful in the MENA region. But the current situation with Iran is prompting many people to rethink the situation. I do not really know how dependent on US help Israel is regarding their campaign in Gaza. I'm tempted to say 'probably not much' but I don't have any data in regard to this. If my gut feeling is right, US help wouldn't mean much militarily, and so wouldn't cutting ties. Also, not receiving US help does not mean not being able to buy weapons on the free market, which brings us to the last case:</p>\n<p><strong>Case 3: Cutting ties for real: embargo and the like</strong></p>\n<p>This is the nuclear option. An embargo or something like that of course would be a very very VERY different thing. Israel is a small state and if they can't even buy stuff from the US/the west they're basically done. This would for sure change the situation wrt Gaza, but it could also have the unintended consequence of wiping Israel off the map (it is surrounded by states that aren't much better and that wouldn't hesitate for long to invade it should an embargo like this be enforced). This is a price no one in their sane mind in the Western centers of power wants to pay, and I consider this happening pure sci-fi currently, just to be completely clear.</p>",

In the absence of such an individual, any time a person is denied one of these basic objects, I can deduce a need of theirs. In particular, there is a vast—truly vast—collection of documentary evidence collected by Palestinian people revealing a systematic denial of all of these things, daily, for years. It is not a radical position to say this is not ok and it is certainly not a radical position to say the people of Palestine need these things. “Get a backpack” is a ludicrous response. Get a backpack, walk to the Gaza strip and discover a magical land where food is optional and being shot at is safe?

You had not, before this message, requested a \"programme for turning war into peace\", so it seems unreasonable to me to act as if I have been withholding one, especially since I did sketch what I am aiming for <a href=\"#narrow/channel/241990-community.3A-discussion/topic/Returning.20a.20medal.2C.20freeing.20a.20people/near/525989945\">here</a>: \"As citizens of [states in the global north fulfilling their responsibility to enforce international law], it in turn falls to us to use all political and social tools at our disposal to pressure our leaders and representatives to fulfil their responsibilities,\" where the latter include the responsibility to intervene to prevent genocide.  </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Your words about anæsthetic and shelter keep reinforcing my intuition that I am talking with well fed citizens of long since developed countries who have no idea about war.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I didn't mention anaesthetic specifically, but besides that, you are right, at least if \"have no idea about war\" means \"have no direct experience of war\".

Nonetheless, I am grateful to you: your attempts to question the legitimacy of protests against government complicity in this genocide has given me more opportunities to talk more about the situation there, and I hope that others who found themselves reacting emotionally to your posts will be able to channel that emotion, too, into action.</p>\n<p>I don't pretend to be able to free Palestine on my own. A collective effort is needed, and we can only create the will for that effort by talking about it and making whatever symbolic acts of resistance might communicate to our peers that we are prepared to take a stand with them.</p>",

you think I should address in particular, then I urge you to chase me with them. You can send me a private message with specific points that need to be answered, it will speed things up.</p>\n<p>I think it is dangerous to take any kind of moderated account of events, such as an Instagram profile, as the basis for ethical or emotional stance of any kind. Even second hand information is, in my experience, always, without exception, biased, not to mention official news and analytics. Even honest and truthful information is always biased by omission. You can only measure the true balance of emotion and conviction by visiting the location, while staying distant in your heart and hidden in plain sight, like the khaliph Harun al-Rashid. You insist that your ethical and emotional stance is well grounded in reality. All I can do is say again that, <em>merely in my opinion</em>, it is not. I want you to persuade me, but you will not be able to persuade me with Instagram profiles because I know a lot more — I know, to however limited extent, how the sausage is made, and what is going on around the sausage factory.</p>\n<p>Think about it like so. You can easily select evidence that confirms that Palestinian people are poor victims of cruel apartheid, and it will be true. But someone else can easily select evidence that confirms that Palestinian people are monsters who rejoice in slaughter of men, women, children, elderly, without discrimination, and it will also be true. None of this makes the situation any clearer. Without first hand experience, it is very hard to know the true balance of emotion and conviction.</p>\n<p>You ask why I am certain that emotional rehashing of standard ideology will, at best, have no effect. This is a very good, hard, and expected question. All I have is the observation that extreme positions like the one you are expressing always promote conflict and degrade the conversation. Big words like <em>«fascism»</em>, <em>«genocide»</em> and <em>«freedom»</em> only serve to pressure detailed and careful thought out of the conversation. I have looked at these words many times over the course of years and I still have no idea what they mean. Standard ideology is unhelpful exactly because it is standard. I do not see how we can hope to find a solution unless we get informed and creative in search of a solution. All you have said so far is not new to me at all, I see this rhetoric every time I look at my social media subscriptions, not only in relation to the war in Israel, but also other wars I keep an eye on. It is the same stuff every time.</p>\n<p>I am not asking you to drop your beliefs — what I am asking for is that you show humility and appreciate your own epistemic limits. You do not have to be a victim of suffering to act against the suffering of others. I never said that you have to be a victim. What I am saying is that you are not acting against the suffering of others in any meaningful way, because you do not even know those others and their suffering. They are <em>other</em>, but you do not even know that. The picture you are painting for me is not representative of the situation at the location. I know this, I cannot tell you how I know this, and it is your choice to either dismiss me or question your own confidence. You can easily gain an edge over me by going somewhere close to the location of interest and taking a look. Until then, I have a tiny little bit more epistemic privilege than you do.</p>\n<p>Do not take me to be saying that there is no indiscriminate slaughter of men, women, children and elderly going on. I also watch some Instagram accounts. I am aware of indiscriminate slaughter. I am waiting for this conversation to proceed to the next stage, where we can talk specifics. But we cannot advance this conversation until you switch off your preacher mode and accept your epistemic limits, just as I accept mine.</p>\n<p>War is bad enough by itself. There is no need to throw around big and meaningless words like <em>«fascism»</em>, <em>«genocide»</em> and <em>«freedom»</em>. In war, bombs will be landing and much more will be lost than body weight. We cannot advance this conversation until you take off your white jacket and roll up the sleeves of your white shirt. In war, nothing is white.</p>\n<p>Think about it like so. Israeli and Arabs have been at war for what, 80 years, more. Not all this time was active conflict, but rifles and bombs were always somewhere in the picture. They were fighting when other states were supplying weapons, but they were also fighting when other states were not supplying weapons. Do you think they were fighting all this time for medicine and clean water? Do you think the political position of the government of France has any bearing on their emotions and convictions?</p>\n<p>A specific point I really want you to dig into is that <em>«freedom»</em> thing you keep mentioning. How do you imagine the freedom of Palestinian people, in legal terms? What claim rights or liberty rights do you wish to grant and to whom? How would it work?</p>",

I will not reply further, but note that insisting on continuing a pseudo-intellectual discourse questioning the validity of an important call for support is neither becoming nor justifiable in the face of the ongoing atrocities.

I think that his position is that pressuring your local government will do very little when it comes to solving the reasons why the war is there in the first place. I tend to agree with this stance.</p>\n<p>I think the conflict at the moment feels so repugnant because of a wildly, deep fighting capability asymmetry, where essentially Israel has access to incredibly effective weapons and the population of Gaza is completely incapable of a response. This is obviously true. One thing tho that I noticed when talking to many Israelis and Palestinians alike is how deep the hate between them runs. I can safely say that, based on pretty much everyone I talked with, if parts were reversed things wouldn't be much better. People of Gaza are, for sure, the victims at the moment, as they have been for years. But if roles were reversed, we'd probably have to write the same of Israelis. By this I mean that, at least according to my personal experience, there is a deep will to completely destroy the counter part on both sides of the fence, with the big difference that one part has much more developed capabilities to actually succeed.</p>\n<p>I think the reason why this is important is that it allows us to better understand what our governments can actually do wrt this situation. They can certainly make the conflict less asymmetric, by either politically pressuring Israel or by endowing groups like Hamas with weapons. Both things are being done atm by different countries, with mixed success. This political pressuring may also intensify to the point where a cease fire is agreed upon. This would certainly be good for everyone living there, and I understand why <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"277473\">@Morgan Rogers (he/him)</span> is so active in this respect.

All I can do is say again that, <em>merely in my opinion</em>, it is not. I want you to persuade me, but you will not be able to persuade me with Instagram profiles because I know a lot more — I know, to however limited extent, how the sausage is made, and what is going on around the sausage factory.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By this rationale, even if I <em>did</em> visit the occupied Palestinian territories and documented all of my experiences on social media, I still could not persuade you, because it would merely be more second-hand information to you. You said early on that you had not visited Israel yourself, and yet you claim to know better than me \"what is going on around the sausage factory\" -- a grotesque choice of phrasing in a discussion about people being murdered en masse, by the way.

That said: suppose that <em>even one</em> Palestinian were to fit the portrait you paint. Would they then deserve to die? Would that justify the starving of children? The destruction of their homes, schools and hospitals? The answer, to me, is a resounding <strong>no</strong>.

While a relevant descriptor of several of the actors in the conflict, I would rather focus on the other two words you highlighted, which are far from meaningless. I insist on using the term <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/genocide-prevention/definition\">genocide</a> because it is more descriptive and more precise than \"war\". We live in a world where certain circumstances can still be used to justify war (at least in a legal sense, to say nothing of a moral one). Israel's stated reason for attacking Iran last month was not one that stood up to those standards of justification, but those standards exist. Genocide, on the other hand, is much more definitively wrong in all cases. \"War\", unqualified, leaves open questions of responsibility and proportionality, and tends to suggest that both involved parties are voluntarily engaging in the conflict. \"Genocide\" makes clear that one side is a victim of the violence of the other, not because of their actions (although Israeli ministers still speak of the threat of Hamas when ordering their attacks) but because of their identity. As for \"freedom\", I agree that this word means many things but it certainly includes a solid foundation of having access to the basics of food, shelter, education and medical care that any person needs to have time and energy to invest in anything else.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Think about it like so. Israeli and Arabs have been at war for what, 80 years, more. Not all this time was active conflict, but rifles and bombs were always somewhere in the picture. They were fighting when other states were supplying weapons, but they were also fighting when other states were not supplying weapons.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Palestine_war\">Palestine war</a>, experienced by the residents as the <em>nakba</em>, where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were displaced, was in 1948-49. This is the war during which the state of Israel was <em>created</em>. That's 77 years ago. Before that, following WWI, Palestine was under British colonial rule. Since then, Israel has waged further war to claim more of what remained of Palestine, displacing hundreds of thousands again, notably in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War\">Six Days War</a> of 1967. There was violent resistance, of course, but then an invasion is one of the remaining justifications of way even today. There was also an increase in 'terrorism' after the war, once that resistance was defeated. If you're going to make an appeal to history, at least look up the timeline...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do you think they were fighting all this time for medicine and clean water?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I do not think they were fighting for medicine and clean water, althoug once Israel was done confiscating land, they also went to the trouble of making sure there were few reliable clean water sources for Palestinians. This does not have much bearing on the fact that Israel is currently holding Gaza under siege, so that Palestinians do not have food or clean water beyond what Israel and the US are forcing them to essentially pass through shooting ranges to collect.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do you think the political position of the government of France has any bearing on their emotions and convictions?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If France took a stance, beyond lip service, against Israel, I do believe this would create greater possibility of other countries doing so. I also think that people in Israel and Palestine are affected by the actions of those in other countries: social media isn't one-directional. If such influence were impossible, there would be no need for Israel to have spent so many decades funding propaganda organisations in western countries designed to maintain a positive public opinion of Israel. I can say with even greater confidence that if France and other countries do not substantively change their political positions then Israel will be allowed to continue their genocide with complete impunity.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A specific point I really want you to dig into is that <em>«freedom»</em> thing you keep mentioning. How do you imagine the freedom of Palestinian people, in legal terms? What claim rights or liberty rights do you wish to grant and to whom? How would it work?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A removal of the apartheid apparatus that enforces a class divide between Palestinians and Israelis, including unrestricted rights to own land and live on it without military interference throughout the (eventually formerly) occupied territory. Self-governance, including control over their judicial system. The release of Palestinian prisoners (many of whom are children!). Access to clean water, resources to rebuild the housing and infrastructure Israel has destroyed. Sufficiently robust international relations to enable them to travel internationally if they so wish, including unsupervised agency over their coastline. I won't go so far as to draw borders or talk about a \"two-state solution\", because I don't know what level of intervention will need to take place before any of these pieces of freedom are reached, but there is at least precedent that some level of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Accords\">peace can be achieved</a> and that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_disengagement_from_the_Gaza_Strip\">Israel can withdraw voluntarily</a> from some of the territory it occupies.</p>",

That the scales of war can only tipped by corpses? How can you expect any war to end if you truly believe that? I do not wish to be part of an army. I want to be part of a movement.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To me, the thought that you can stop any current war by waving flags and sailing on a yacht is what is ludicrous and outrageous in this conversation. It is so detached form reality it is beyond words.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The crew of the Madleen did not set sail expecting to end the war. They hoped, in the best case, to bring a small amount of relief to Gaza. In the worst case, they were prepared to die to draw further attention to Gaza's war crimes, which was not unlikely: the boat for the original voyage was bombed by Israel. They would have met your epistemic standards but they were denied entry. I resent you belittling their bravery. They succeeded in drawing some media attention, but more significantly in growing the movement of support for Palestine internationally by highlighting the continued <em>inaction</em> of heads of state.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>By waving flags, you can only position yourself on one particular side. And without a clever strategy, taking any side will only fan the flames of war. If you wave a flag, you better be ready to take a rifle and go to the front line. Because, by waving that flag, you inspire others to do so.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Waving a flag is an act of resistance. You are not the only one to be upset by it. Across the world we have seen violent reactions to the Palestinian flag, yet a flag is not inherently a weapon. \"By waving that flag, you inspire others to do so.\" That sounds like a beautiful thing to me.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Put down that flag, @Morgan Rogers (he/him). You have no idea what it stands for. Put it down and protest all you want without any flag. Lest you be confused with a warmonger and a coward.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I do often feel like a coward. Participating in protests under consistent threat of police violence, signing petitions, contacting people, advocacy... These are things I am brave enough to do, and little more. Yet these small acts are still more than the majority of people make the time to do, and to the few I manage to reach they make a difference.<br>\nThat admission aside, I have had quite enough of you accusing me of ignorance.</p>",

In spite of my absence it has been on my mind constantly.</p>\n<p>My belief is that there is nothing that can justify starving children, targeting medics, killing journalists or destroying schools. These are things that the state if Israel has done and are continuing to do in Gaza. No one has contested this.</p>\n<p>You may be right that my limited actions can have little impact on the fact that these things are happening. However, I can hope to participate in ending the complicity of the institutions within my sphere of influence. I can refuse to engage with institutions while they are complicit. I can, at a bare minimum, refuse to stay silent about it. In some cases one might think it better to dismantle the institutions that are failing their responsibilities, and there are current cases where I agree. Yet to effect such (more radical) change would require more people's involvement, and I have never met anyone who was brave enough to work towards dismantling institutions who didn't previously participate in protests.</p>\n<p>I am sorry that even sanctions on a country may not be enough to end a war. I am sorry that you do not feel safe enough where you are to say whether you have travelled outside of your country in public. I understand that my privilege is protecting me from some aspects of reality as you experience it. I accept that, because I am limiting myself to actions I feel I can take without sacrificing my own freedom or privileges, I may seem naive to you. However, that same privilege is obstructing millions of people, including many people here, from even asking themselves the question \"What could I be doing?\" and that is an essential element of the tragedy.</p>\n<p>You demand of me a detailed plan of how my actions will effect change in Palestine. I am not a leader, I am not an organiser of the protests I participate in. I look to those with greater experience in activism, who have a track record of successfully campaigning for change, for instruction as to what I can do. In other words, I follow expert advice. I encourage anyone who is still reading this to do the same.</p>\n<p>Finally, you asked me what I meant by \"freedom\", seemingly with the sole intent of telling me that I couldn't possibly have given an answer that you would have accepted. Ultimately it doesn't matter whether I have a crisp definition that you can debate the parameters of or a vaguely defined ideal: the freedom of Palestine is an aspiration, a summary of the cause. Should it ever come to pass, I do not expect or even wish to be invited to adjudicate it, to impose my own notion of freedom.</p>\n<p>Free Palestine. <span aria-label=\"flag palestinian territories\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f1f5-1f1f8\" role=\"img\" title=\"flag palestinian territories\">:flag_palestinian_territories:</span></p>",

        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"277473\">@Morgan Rogers (he/him)</span>   If you mean to say that we should try to mobilize more people to ask themselves the question <em>«what could I be doing»</em>, then I agree with you on this. However, I insist that efforts at understanding the situation should come hand in hand with action, if not precede it. It is the understanding of the situation that I am trying to pursue in this conversation. Are you hinting that this is off topic? Be straight with me. Are you trying to trap me into repeated <em>«off topic»</em> violation and remove me from this conversation? I am not your enemy, but taking away my freedom of speech is a sure way to make me into one. In your own words, I can, at a bare minimum, refuse to stay silent about it.</p>\n<p>I think <em>«waving the flag of Palestine»</em> is a bad answer to the question <em>«what could I be doing»</em>. This flag does not have a connotation of peaceful freedom. The flag of Palestine is as thoroughly soaked in the blood of innocent bystanders as the flag of Israel. I am not sure if you, after reviewing available evidence, concluded that Palestinians are a thoroughly peaceful bunch. As far as I know, they have been harassing the Israeli since long before there was Israel.</p>\n<p>Let us review the recent history. An organization called Hamas or, in full, <em>Islamic Resistance Movement</em>, has been elected to rule Palestine in 2006. Everyone agreed that the election was fair and represented the will of the people. In 2007, after a short civil war, <em>Islamic Resistance Movement</em> gained full control of the Gaza Strip. Since then, the rule of <em>Islamic Resistance Movement</em> in the Gaza Strip has been uncontested. All that was asked of them is to renounce violence, recognize Israel and accept past peace deals. But <em>Islamic Resistance Movement</em> declined. They chose the path of <em>«resistance in all its forms»</em>. <em><a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2007/3/22/palestinians-reject-quartet-demands\">(Quote from Ismail Haniya.)</a></em> I ask you again: do you support armed struggle of the Palestinian people against the Israeli occupation?</p>\n<p>Here is <a href=\"https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hamas.asp\">the official manifest</a> of <em>Islamic Resistance Movement</em>. If you read it, I expect you will agree with my conclusion that for them, <em>«justice»</em>, <em>«mercy»</em> and <em>«freedom»</em> mean <em>«Islam»</em>, their goal is to establish an Islamic state all over the historical Palestine, and their chosen way to do so is Jihad. What you understand as <em>«justice»</em>, <em>«mercy»</em> and <em>«freedom»</em> has little to do with what they understand as <em>«justice»</em>, <em>«mercy»</em> and <em>«freedom»</em>. If they were to establish their <em>«justice»</em>, <em>«mercy»</em> and <em>«freedom»</em> over France, there would be nothing left of France as we know it. In your own words, their politics does not recognize someone else's right to exist. This is whose flag you are waving.</p>\n<p>I am not your enemy. I was not expecting of you a definition of <em>«freedom»</em> I should have accepted. It was surprising for me to hear your definition of freedom, and I was expecting to be surprised. But my definition of freedom and your definition of freedom are compatible. The definition of freedom of <em>Islamic Resistance Movement</em> is not compatible with my definition of freedom <em>(although compatible with your stated definition, which does not include freedom of faith)</em>. To them, we are infidel. At best, we can hope our lives to be spared. But we shall not be allowed to teach our ways. In the schools of <em>Islamic Resistance Movement</em>, the study of Koran will be the first topic.</p>\n<p>If you followed my suggestion and read about Nazareth, you have discovered that there is no Jew to be found there, even though everyone is Israeli, at least on paper. This shows that Israel allows any religion and any lifestyle to be followed, at any scale. Israel is the most diverse land in the world. Compare this with Jewish settlements in West Bank Palestine. There is no sight more chilling than these lifeless streets cordoned off from the Arabic Palestine by constantly vigilant military presence. Stones, rifles and the lingering smell of tear gas. The freedom of Palestine, even on the West Bank, even in Nazareth, is, as you can see with your own eyes if you travel there, freedom from Jews. Were Palestine to be <em>«freed»</em> by <em>Islamic Resistance Movement</em>, it is not only you who will not be invited to adjudicate the freedom of Palestine, it is also the millions of Israeli living there who will not be.</p>\n<p>You say you want a movement, not an army. Well, Islamic Jihad is a movement that has several armies and whole states as components. Have you any awareness of the situation in Syria right now? We can dream that <em>Islamic Resistance Movement</em>, having defeated Israel, would turn it into a peaceful and prosperous Islamic country like Saudi Arabia. But I think Islamic Palestine is more likely to become another Syria, another Afghanistan or another Islamic State of Iraq and Levant. Jews only want their tiny piece of land. The Islamic Jihad movement wants the whole world. Is this your kind of movement? This is whose flag you are waving.</p>\n<p>I am not your enemy. I was not demanding a plan so detailed that you cannot be expected to put it forward. But I need from you a theory consistent with the sum of what we know so far. The theory you have offered so far is at once sparse and inconsistent. It appeared to me at first, and still appears to me now, that you have chosen the most fanatical of the available approaches to the situation. If this is what your leaders offer you, then you have been misled by your leaders into being an unwitting instrument of propaganda in the hand of Islamic Jihad.</p>\n<p>What I suggest is that we try to select, at first, a small amount of propositions we can agree upon, that would form a core of our theory. In the ideal, I want to be able to recruit my Israeli friends, my Palestinian friends, my Turkish friends, my Omani friends, and so on, to support that small but strong core. Your theory is only suitable for you and your fanatical friends who have not been anywhere and know nothing of the world outside their immediate surroundings. This theory will not be effective.</p>\n<p>Is it bad to starve children, target medics, kill journalists and destroy schools? Yes, it is bad to starve children, target medics, kill journalists and destroy schools. But perhaps these things are locally justified. It is hard to think of a collective undertaking that is not justified within that collective. Insofar as these things are done by Israeli army, they must be locally justified therein. We need to establish the events, reveal the justifications, and crush these justifications. This is where I suggest you direct your energy, instead of waving a flag soaked in blood. You can make a table of events and justifications, and put it online. It will be helpful.</p>\n<p>Let me address one point in particular. You say:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am sorry that you do not feel safe enough where you are to say whether you have travelled outside of your country in public.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I know this is a recent custom in some lands, but there is no need to qualify every sentence with <em>«sorry»</em> and <em>«feel»</em>. You said yourself that you cannot visit Israel. For someone burning with desire to change Israel, this is a bad outcome. I have done some non-safe things, but throwing away my privilege of travel would simply be a stupid move. Although, to reiterate, I have not visited and do not plan to visit any questionable locations. All my information is strictly second hand. Maybe even third hand.</p>",

A few quotes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Protests work because they can undermine the most important pillar of power: legitimacy.\"<br>\n\"Protests are a grab for attention: They are an attempt to force a conversation about the topic they’re highlighting.\" (hence my continuation of the conversation here)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In France specifically, labour unions are involved in a majority of protests, and encourage participation in them. They lobby the government and employers, and turnout at protests is an effective metric for support of a given cause, since protest is a physical manifestation of public opinion. Related actions include strikes, donations and petition signing. Organisations that campaign for change in other arenas, such as Greenpeace <a href=\"https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/volunteering/direct-action/\">train volunteers</a> in taking (peaceful) direct action, and are similarly dependent on public support of their actions through protest, whence their campaigns to protect the right to protest where it is under threat (which feels like most places at the moment, to be honest). Individual people involved in previous liberation movements (feminist, civil rights, anti-apartheid...) have attributed the successes of those movements to the collective actions, especially protesting.<br>\nIn short, every group that I see advocating for the causes I am trying to support encourages protesting as a basic form of solidarity. These are my experts. What exactly is it that you think I'm giving up here?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If the US is enough of a parallel, which is certainly may not be, then perhaps the single most fundamentally shared characteristic of left-wing protest through my adult life [...] is its profound structurelessness. There is nobody leading the pro-Palestine protest movement here, and indeed this is explicitly celebrated by the protestors as consistent with an ideology that, while it seems to hardly have theorists, comes across to me as much more black than red (pace the DSA, kind of, which I think tries to maintain some sort of democratic centralism in the face of strong anti-hierarchical cultural currents.) in short while I certainly believe there are experts in any number of aspects of the conflict in Palestine, as far as I can tell they’re writing white papers, not leading the movement in the streets. Who are the experts in accomplishing change via protest you see leading the charge?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don't know what \"more black than red\" means, or what \"pace the DSA\" means.</p>\n<p>I suppose that you imagine that previous movements had key individuals \"leading the charge\" because that is how the history is often presented in the US. Perhaps Martin Luther King Jr and Nelson Mandela spring to mind. I'll quote Angela Y. Davis again (simply because I have one of her books, <em>Freedom is a constant struggle</em>, to hand). On Dr. King:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Dominant representations of the Black freedom movement are a discrete series of historical moments largely produced by the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott. And somehow, although Martin Luther King Jr. himself began to emerge to prominence as a consequence of that boycott, he is seen as always already the orator and leader of the civil rights movement.<br>\n\"Even though numbers of books, both scholarly and popular, have been written on the role of women in the 1955 boycott, Dr. King, who was actually invited to be a spokesperson for a movement when he was entirely unknown--the movement had already formed--Dr. King remains the dominant figure.<br>\n\"And I wonder, will we ever truly recognize the collective subject of history that was itself produced by radical organizing? Early on during the 1930s/1940s, and I am referring, for example, to an organization which was known as the Southern Negro Youth Congress, which has largely been excised from the official historical record  because some of its key leaders were communists.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On Nelson Mandela (bearing in mind that this was published in 2016 from a speech in <strong>December 2013</strong>, shortly after his death; emphasis mine):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"While it is moving to witness the unanimous and continued outpouring of praise for Nelson Mandela, it is important to question the meaning of his sanctification. I know that he himself would have insisted on not being elevated, as a single individual, to a secular sainthood, but rather would have always claimed space for his comrades in the struggle and in this way would have seriously challenged the process of sanctification. He was indeed extraordinary, but as an individual he was especially remarkable because he railed against the individualism that would single him out at the expense of others who were always at his side.<br>\n[...]<br>\n\"This is the context in which I join you once more to intensify campaigns against another regime of apartheid and in solidarity with the struggles of the Palestinian people. <strong>As Nelson Mandela said, 'We know too well that our freedom is incomplete without the freedom of the Palestinians.'</strong> \"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When opposing governments that are prepared to use violence in all its forms to repress opposition, having a clearly declared leadership is a liability: they become the targets of smear campaigns that discredit their campaigns by association, or some pretext is created to arrest them and remove whatever momentum in the movement depended on their personality. Nonetheless, there are organisers and local leaders giving structure to the action that are taken, following the increasingly baroque protocols required for a protest to be considered 'legal', gathering the vehicles, banners, microphones and speakers, arranging for the safe participation of speakers (politicians, activists, scholars), communicating with the media... Having these responsibilities suitably diffuse is protection against repression. So yes, this absence of clear leaders is a deliberate choice.</p>",

accept your corrections.</p>\n<p>You say that we should not attribute harassment of Israeli to Palestinians, because such rhetoric is used to justify the ongoing massacres. I understand what you mean. Rhetorical convenience matters. I spent so much time trying to persuade Morgan that it is a bad idea to wave a Palestinian flag. How am I different, waving attribution of harassment of Israeli to Palestinians? This is a good and timely question. The difference is that I am waving something we can use to understand and eventually hopefully improve the situation.</p>\n<p>Humans have a propensity for group behaviour. We are good at negotiating agreement with one another. I do not believe we can make any progress without recognizing that we are talking about groups of people, not individual humans. In particular, there is a group called <em>«Palestinian people»</em>, and there are certain negotiated agreements holding this group together.</p>\n<p>Let us try an example. Romans demolished Carthage. Did every particular Roman participate in the demolition of Carthage? No. Most Romans were not even living in the same time period. But there was a negotiated agreement among the Romans at the time to demolish Carthage. In the same way, Palestinians have been harassing the Israeli since long before there was Israel. Did every particular Palestinian participate in the harassment of the Israeli? No. So?</p>\n<p>Are you saying that Palestinians have not been harassing the Israeli since long before there was Israel? No, you are not saying that. If you were to say that, I should remind you of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1929_Hebron_massacre\">the massacre in Hebron on 23 of August 1929</a>, for instance. And already we read that some Jews were sheltered and survived. Sheltered — by Palestinians, from Palestinians. Is this surprising? No, this is not surprising. Big groups are made of smaller groups, there are intersections of groups, the assignment of humans to groups is a complex mathematical object. However: they sheltered them, but they did not rise to stop the bloodshed. An agreement was negotiated.</p>\n<p>The talking points of the Palestinian resistance and the two state solution are built upon the concept of <em>«Palestinian people»</em>. And there was no such concept as <em>«Palestinian people»</em> before the XX century. It has been constructed. It was fiercely contested during the XX century, and was eventually successfully established and codified. Palestinians wanted to be recognized as a group, and they succeeded.</p>\n<p>Palestinians wanted to be recognized as a group. You do not get to be recognized as a group when it is favourable to you <em>(we suffer genocide, we need our own state)</em> and not be recognized as a group when it is not favourable to you <em>(our elected government sets removal of all infidels from the whole extent of our historically claimed land as its first goal)</em>. No. Palestinians wanted to be recognized as a group, and they succeeded. Now, they are recognized as a group. Moreover, they wanted to be recognized as a historically rooted group, a people, a people that has a claim on the land of Palestine. They wanted their ancestors to also be recognized as <em>Palestinian people</em>, so as to reinforce their claim on the land of Palestine. And they succeeded.</p>\n<p>Further, I insist that we recognize that throwing stones at Israeli soldiers under the watchful eye of international observers is the favourite pastime of Palestinian schoolchildren, for example, in Hebron. The situation is that bad. These are not isolated incidents. The harassment is systemic, the hate is widespread. It is a culture of hate, that large numbers of Palestinians are indoctrinated into since childhood, for generations. If you can show that what I am saying here is false, please do so at your earliest convenience, because the truth as I know it is terrifying. I am eager to draw better conclusions — I only lack better facts.</p>\n<p>I am lost as to what we can do here. Is this rhetorically inconvenient? I am not an expert on rhetorical convenience, and I readily accept your judgement that this is rhetorically inconvenient. So what can we do? Bury the evidence and forget?</p>\n<p>You say my rhetoric is used to justify the ongoing massacres. If you have a specific example of justification of the ongoing massacres, bring it in. What is being justified and how exactly is it being justified? We should establish the events, reveal the justifications, and crush these justifications. The only way I see to stop the war for good is to crush <em>all</em> of the justifications for it, on both sides.</p>\n<p>You also say some black and white fantasy of Jewish tolerance versus Islamic intolerance should be disqualified. I allow that such a fantasy exists in many places, please go and disqualify it from there. But there is no such fantasy here.</p>\n<p>What I said is that the freedom of Palestine is freedom from Jews. This is not a deep inference — the fairly elected government of Palestine spelled this out in their manifest that I linked in the message you quote. And their actions align with their manifest. We can see that this understanding of freedom is shared by Palestinians outside the Gaza Strip by looking at the examples of Hebron and Nazareth. You will not find a Jew in Nazareth, and the small Israeli population of Hebron is guarded around the clock by the Israeli army from a very real danger. Do you wish to challenge these facts?</p>\n<p>Or do you wish to challenge the fact that many Arabs, who may otherwise be called Palestinians, have been accepted by the Israeli society, and some even serve in the Israeli army? Maybe you wish to challenge the fact that the newly installed government of Syria, a component of the Islamic Jihad movement, has allowed, if not approved of, if not participated in, large scale violence against any and every ethnoreligious minority in their land?</p>\n<p>Please do not say something like <em>«not all Islamic people are radical»</em> or <em>«not all Israeli people are tolerant»</em> or <em>«nothing is black and white»</em>. You do not need to say this to me, at least. I have been saying all along that nothing is black and white. It is Morgan who has been saying all along that Israel is black and Palestine is white. What I said is that all of their flags are soaked in blood, both Israeli and Palestinian. And their hands are covered in blood to the elbow. Do you understand what <em>«war»</em> means? I do. At war, nothing is white.</p>\n<p>My question is <em>«how do we bring peace»</em>. My answer is that we need to crush all justifications for war, on both sides. Are these justifications symmetric? I think they are not. What do you think?</p>\n<p>Lastly:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All that was asked of them is to renounce violence, recognize Israel and accept past peace deals.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is a mountain of evidence that this is not true, that such “proposals” have not been made in good faith, and the fact that IDF-backed settlers have been harassing and terrorising the population of the West Bank, where Hamas is not in charge or present in any significant form, is incontrovertible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Not sure if we are on the same page here. I am talking about the conditions imposed by <em>Quartet on the Middle East</em> on <em>Islamic Resistance Movement</em> after their success in the election of 2006. These conditions were refused, I linked a relevant news article in the message you quote. The only goal of <em>Quartet on the Middle East</em>, as far as I know, was to facilitate the two state solution. If you have evidence that they were not working in good faith, please bring it in.</p>\n<p>I am not sure what this has to do with the West Bank Palestine and IDF-backed settlers. What I said is that <em>Islamic Resistance Movement</em> was asked and refused to renounce violence, recognize Israel and accept past peace deals. I do not understand what you are disagreeing with.</p>",

It's much easier to be willing to forget the past when the economy is booming. Compare this with what happened in Weimar around 1920-1930.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It also helps to have an allied superpower forcing you to stop fighting and defending you from a threatening superpower…</p>",

Naturally enough, Hamas continued shooting rockets into Israel, and Israel has responded to these attacks with a long series of bloody invasions starting as early as 2008. The West Bank is not subject to anything like the same level of violent repression, though of course all is not rosy and Israeli settlers continue taking more and more of the West Bank, in an obvious effort to eventually annex it by fait accompli. Bad as both situations are, I totally deny that the outcomes have been “roughly the same” for the first 17 years. </p>\n<p>Anyway, since it seems that the straw consequentialist is not in the room with us on either side, this is largely neither here nor there.

That's why there's a reasonably stable anti-Russian coalition in the West; I don't think the fact that ethical reasons are also deployed for rhetorical benefit affects the point much. The ethical justification for opposition to Israel, which is that you shouldn't use your neighbors' crimes against you as justification to execute an extremely unmerciful invasion against them, is probably held by a smaller proportion of both the population and the leadership of Western countries, while the pragmatic justification is basically nil, since as we seem to agree, there are no proposals for actually resolving the conflict that either Israel or any plausible representative of Palestine would accept under any plausible pattern of pressure in the foreseeable future.

It is therefore with a heavy heart that I have decided to return my two medals — a bronze (1988) and a silver (1989). I am doing so in response to the IMO leadership’s refusal to take any meaningful stance on the ongoing genocide in Gaza, and to its political maneuvers aimed at shielding Israel from accountability.</p>\n<p>Since October 2023, Israel has <a href=\"http://ziko.mjt.lu/lnk/AV4AAHQ9aEkAAc6qIk4AA8kmaG0AAYCrIwoAn_P5AAYNfwBof0V8jiY3h7huTxC8Cp3O9eKqcgAFzBk/1/ywer4_dOv6CcMydnS26_yg/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub2NoYW9wdC5vcmcvY29udGVudC9yZXBvcnRlZC1pbXBhY3Qtc25hcHNob3QtZ2F6YS1zdHJpcC0xNi1qdWx5LTIwMjU\">killed</a> more than 58,500 Palestinians in Gaza, including over 17,900 children. It has destroyed all universities, targeted hospitals and schools, and imposed a famine. UN experts and international jurists have described the situation as genocidal.</p>\n<p>In 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine, the IMO Board <a href=\"http://ziko.mjt.lu/lnk/AV4AAHQ9aEkAAc6qIk4AA8kmaG0AAYCrIwoAn_P5AAYNfwBof0V8jiY3h7huTxC8Cp3O9eKqcgAFzBk/2/RqCZphO1FH5fc_ZgDL1U_g/aHR0cHM6Ly93ZWIuYXJjaGl2ZS5vcmcvd2ViLzIwMjIwMzMxMTAxMDA2L2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmltby1vZmZpY2lhbC5vcmcv\">reacted</a> within weeks. It invoked the Force Majeure clause, proposed a resolution, and organized an electronic vote. The Jury <a href=\"http://ziko.mjt.lu/lnk/AV4AAHQ9aEkAAc6qIk4AA8kmaG0AAYCrIwoAn_P5AAYNfwBof0V8jiY3h7huTxC8Cp3O9eKqcgAFzBk/3/AoHtW9p6kwEJyyyfDa4spA/aHR0cHM6Ly93ZWIuYXJjaGl2ZS5vcmcvd2ViLzIwMjIwMzMxMTAxMDA2L2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmltby1vZmZpY2lhbC5vcmcvZG9jdW1lbnRzL1ZvdGluZ18yMDIyMDMyNS5wZGY\">voted</a> to suspend Russia’s membership as a state, while allowing its students to compete as individuals.</p>\n<p>In 2024, when similar demands were made regarding Israel, the same Board refused to act. Instead, it changed the regulations to prohibit any “political use” of the IMO. This change had a chilling effect. Delegation leaders reported an atmosphere of fear. Any mention of Gaza was discouraged.</p>\n<p>In April 2025, over 700 mathematicians — including Fields medalists, IMO team leaders, and contestants — signed a <a href=\"http://ziko.mjt.lu/lnk/AV4AAHQ9aEkAAc6qIk4AA8kmaG0AAYCrIwoAn_P5AAYNfwBof0V8jiY3h7huTxC8Cp3O9eKqcgAFzBk/4/MU3oGpXVtu663io43vKLDA/aHR0cHM6Ly9kb2NzLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vZG9jdW1lbnQvZC8xRUZJSlVZbTZnaEtGRHhvYmp2SFVZZzNJb01hOEdJSk03YUUzdk5YQmZmay9lZGl0P3VzcD1zaGFyaW5n\">petition</a> calling for Israel’s suspension as a state, following the precedent of Russia. The petition also denounced the IMO Board’s efforts to prevent discussion.</p>\n<p>In June 2025, a <a href=\"http://ziko.mjt.lu/lnk/AV4AAHQ9aEkAAc6qIk4AA8kmaG0AAYCrIwoAn_P5AAYNfwBof0V8jiY3h7huTxC8Cp3O9eKqcgAFzBk/5/tFZCQCAfba6cWc6pSza-sA/aHR0cHM6Ly9kb2NzLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vZG9jdW1lbnQvZC8xaWxkVWs2UENXREhIN1pNVExRVVhEa0czWUh3RUlOSVZscGUwcXY4dHI4NC9lZGl0P3VzcD1zaGFyaW5n\">draft resolution</a> was submitted to the Jury, supported by over 500 members of the mathematical community. It proposed to apply the same measure used in 2022: suspend Israel’s state membership while maintaining the participation rights of its students as individuals.</p>\n<p>Faced with overwhelming support for the resolution, particularly from the global south, and no longer able to sustain its double standard, the IMO Board <a href=\"http://ziko.mjt.lu/lnk/AV4AAHQ9aEkAAc6qIk4AA8kmaG0AAYCrIwoAn_P5AAYNfwBof0V8jiY3h7huTxC8Cp3O9eKqcgAFzBk/6/H156TPpJFhC_3X2UiklqTA/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2F1c3RyYWxpYS1uZXdzLzIwMjUvanVsLzE5L2Nhbi1hLWNvbW1vbi1kZW5vbWluYXRvci11bml0ZS13YXJyaW5nLWNvbnRlc3RhbnQtbmF0aW9ucy1hdC10aGUtaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1tYXRoZW1hdGljcy1vbHltcGlhZC1udHduZmI\">introduced</a> a last-minute counter-resolution during the July 2025 Olympiad in Australia. It declared that “measures against IMO participating countries will only be taken for violations of IMO regulations,” and that “all current suspensions expire at the end of IMO 2025.” By doing so, the Board effectively asserted that internal IMO rules outweigh international law, including the UN Charter, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The counter-resolution was adopted. </p>\n<p>In an effort to shield Israel from accountability for its crimes, the Board has thus resorted to lifting sanctions on Russia and effectively whitewashing Putin’s crimes in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>IMO Board president Gregor Dolinar later confirmed that financial considerations played a role: “Sponsors do not want to deal with politically motivated organizations,” he <a href=\"http://ziko.mjt.lu/lnk/AV4AAHQ9aEkAAc6qIk4AA8kmaG0AAYCrIwoAn_P5AAYNfwBof0V8jiY3h7huTxC8Cp3O9eKqcgAFzBk/7/dxX6YB9cmg45P5tXt687lg/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL2F1c3RyYWxpYS1uZXdzLzIwMjUvanVsLzE5L2Nhbi1hLWNvbW1vbi1kZW5vbWluYXRvci11bml0ZS13YXJyaW5nLWNvbnRlc3RhbnQtbmF0aW9ucy1hdC10aGUtaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1tYXRoZW1hdGljcy1vbHltcGlhZC1udHduZmI\">told</a> <em>The Guardian</em>. Dolinar claims to be apolitical, but there is no more political act than choosing to shield a state from accountability in the face of a genocide. By silencing debate, manipulating rules to block any response, and ensuring that Israel would be treated differently from Russia, he has engaged in the worst kind of politics — the politics of denial and complicity. In doing so, he has profoundly betrayed the principles the IMO claims to stand for.</p>\n<p>This year, a student from Gaza who had qualified for the IMO was finally evacuated just days before the competition, under extremely difficult conditions, by the French consular services. We had hoped for an earlier evacuation that would have allowed him to participate in person, but that proved impossible. He reached Paris on a special pass, and I had the great honor of hosting him. He took part in the competition remotely from my house starting at 4:30 am — despite twenty months of war, and the immense emotional toll of having left his family in a war zone only days earlier. He earned an honorable mention, and would likely have done better had he been given the same conditions as the other students. Still, he was deeply happy to take part (after being excluded the year before), and is now looking forward to beginning his mathematical studies in one of the best schools in France.</p>\n<p>Despite everything I’ve read about the horror in Gaza over the past twenty months, welcoming a child who had just escaped what is now effectively a concentration camp confronted me with a level of suffering that is almost impossible to bear. What keeps me going are his smiles in the morning, and his calm, persistent love of mathematics. </p>\n<p>I do not wish to be associated with an institution that remains silent about his ordeal — and the ordeal of his people — simply because they are Palestinians. I return my medals accordingly.</p>\n<p>Ahmed Abbes</p>\n<p>CNRS &amp; IHES</p>\n</blockquote>",

Our teams provide surgical care, wound and burn care, malnutrition screening and treatment, maternal and pediatric care, physiotherapy, vaccination, mental health support, water and sanitation support, and care for non-communicable diseases, among other services. We are also providing rehabilitative care for war-wounded children we've managed to evacuate to our reconstructive surgery hospital in Amman, <a href=\"https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/where-we-work/jordan\">Jordan</a>.</p>\n<h4>Facilities MSF has run or supported in Gaza</h4>\n<p>MSF teams have carried out lifesaving work in health facilities across Gaza, including in the Strip's largest hospitals and our own clinics and field hospital. However, due to extremely volatile conditions on the ground—including attacks on health facilities and recurrent evacuation orders—our teams have had to move from facility to facility and continually adapt our activities. Hospitals and clinics we have supported during this war include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nasser Hospital, European Gaza Hospital, and Martyrs, Beni Suhaila, Khan Younis, Al-Qarara, and Al-Attar clinics in Khan Younis</li>\n<li>Al-Aqsa Hospital and the MSF field hospital in Deir al-Balah    </li>\n<li>Al-Awda Hospital and mobile clinics in northern Gaza</li>\n<li>Al-Shifa Hospital, Al Helou Maternity Hospital, and our clinic in Gaza City   </li>\n<li>Rafah Indonesian Field Hospital, Emirati Maternity Hospital, Al-Najjar Hospital, and Al-Mawasi Health Post in Rafah</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Water and sanitation activities</h4>\n<p>A lack of <a href=\"https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/water-being-used-weapon-war-gaza\">drinkable water</a>, poor sanitation, and the destruction of water <a href=\"https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/how-year-war-has-devastated-gazas-civilian-infrastructure\">infrastructure</a> have had dire consequences for people’s health in Gaza. Of more than 82,000 primary health care consultations MSF conducted in the first two months of this year, nearly a fifth were related to conditions linked with lack of water and hygiene, such as scabies and other skin conditions. This is why water distribution is an important part of MSF’s response.  </p>\n<p>Between January and the end of April 2025, MSF teams distributed over 60 million liters of clean water and produced over 7.8 million liters through desalination. However, the already-dire water crisis in Gaza has worsened after Israeli authorities halted aid from entering the Strip on March 2, and then cut electricity on March 9, as water pumps and desalination plants require fuel and power to operate.</p>\n<h4>Humanitarian aid and medical supplies</h4>\n<p>Since Israeli authorities halted the flow of humanitarian aid and other supplies into the Strip on March 2, food, fuel, and medical stocks have been <a href=\"https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/gaza-critical-medical-supplies-are-running-out\">depleted</a>. This total blockade of aid has deprived people of most basic needs and could lead to a high number of health complications and deaths.</p>\n<p>Prior to the total siege, MSF provided over 636 tons of logistic and medical equipment from our international supply centers—as much as 30 planes or 130 trucks full. However, some supplies that are critical to our operations and the security of our staff have been difficult to transport into Gaza. These include generators, desalination stations and motor pumps, oxygen concentrators, vehicles, and equipment for communication.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I think the authors characterized this as perhaps a result of having already practiced, with the case of physics, the taking of a body of knowledge substantially on trust, which turned out over time to have been completely true. There seems to be something analogous in Aaronson's thinking, where he took a certain kind of what you might call \"third-wave feminist fundamentalism\", something you might argue was a caricature of the most common belief among 2000's and 2010's feminists, very literally, becoming afflicted with the disease that looks like that called \"scrupulosity\" by Catholics.  Scrupulosity is essentially the conviction that God/the Universe/moral truth/the collective holding the right to the legitimate use of moral judgment fundamentally hates you, and it is indeed an agonizing affliction. The kind of fundamentalist Zionism that Scott is now proclaiming (I think he would hardly object to this phrasing) seems to arise from the same instinct of taking things very literally and drawing out all their logical implications which, though often a strength in mathematical science, results in what I would consider deformed spiritual attitudes in the other four cases at issue. I suspect a lot of young mathematicians end up drawn into some fundamentalism in much the same way as Aaronson, and the only obvious protection (\"mechanism stopping\") I can see is to begin mathematical thinking while already embedded in some more complete and humane anthropology.</p>",
