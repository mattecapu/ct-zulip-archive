This funding was diverted toward questionable projects that promoted Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) or advanced neo-Marxist class warfare propaganda.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One of these grants is Emily Riehl's project \"Homotopical macrocosms for higher category theory\".    </p>\n<p>You can see a complete list of all 3,400 grants on a spreadsheet <a href=\"https://www.commerce.senate.gov/index.cfm?a=files.serve&amp;File_id=94060590-F32F-4944-8810-300E6766B1D6\">here</a>.     The grants are classified as mentioning one or more of 4 things: social justice, race, gender, and environmental justice.  Riehl's grant is flagged as mentioning social justice.   She probably got in trouble for the following passage:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>IN PARALLEL, THE PI HAS CONCRETE PLANS TO CONTINUE HER EXPOSITORY AND OUTREACH WORK WHICH INCLUDE A NEW BOOK (ELEMENTS OF INFINITY-CATEGORY THEORY, JOINT WITH VERITY), LECTURES DIRECTED AT THE GENERAL PUBLIC, SURVEY ARTICLES PREPARED FOR A VARIETY OF AUDIENCES, AND EFFORTS TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO ADVANCED MATHEMATICS, SUCH AS HER SERVICE ON THE EQUITY, DIVERSITY, AND INCLUSION ADVISORY BOARD AT THE BANFF INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH STATION.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Below I have quoted the entire grant description on that spreadsheet:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>HOMOTOPICAL MACROCOSMS FOR HIGHER CATEGORY THEORY - HIGHER CATEGORY THEORY IS INCREASINGLY BEING USED AS THE METATHEORY FOR NEW RESULTS IN SEVERAL AREAS OF MATHEMATICS, CREATING A HUGE BARRIER TO ENTRY FOR MATHEMATICIANS WHOSE PRIMARY TECHNICAL EXPERTISE LIES IN ANOTHER FIELD. PAST JOINT WORK OF THE PI REIMAGINED THE FOUNDATIONS OF INFINITE-DIMENSIONAL CATEGORY THEORY WITH THE AIM OF SIMPLIFYING PROOFS BY REPLACING ANALYTIC METHODS, THAT RELY ON THE COMBINATORICS OF A PARTICULAR MODEL OF INFINITE-DIMENSIONAL CATEGORIES, WITH SYNTHETIC ONES THAT APPLY IN ANY MODEL. ONE PART OF THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO DEVELOP A COMPUTER-VERIFIABLE FORMAL LANGUAGE THAT EXPRESSES ONLY STATEMENTS ABOUT INFINITE-DIMENSIONAL CATEGORIES THAT ARE INVARIANT UNDER CHANGE OF MODEL. SUCH A LANGUAGE WOULD FORCE USERS TO SPEAK NO EVIL BY GUARANTEEING THAT EVERY STATEMENT THEY EXPRESS IS MODEL-INDEPENDENT. THIS PROJECT CONNECTS TO THE PLANS TO RECAST THE THEORY OF INFINITE-DIMENSIONAL CATEGORIES IN A NEW PROPOSED UNIVALENT FOUNDATION SYSTEM FOR MATHEMATICS, IN WHICH HOMOTOPICAL UNIQUENESS UP TO A CONTRACTIBLE SPACE OF CHOICES BECOMES GENUINE UNIQUENESS, PERMITTING STREAMLINED DEFINITIONS OF FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS. BOTH OF THESE PROJECTS WILL BE UNDERTAKEN IN PART WITH MENTEES OF THE PI AT JOHNS HOPKINS. IN PARALLEL, THE PI HAS CONCRETE PLANS TO CONTINUE HER EXPOSITORY AND OUTREACH WORK WHICH INCLUDE A NEW BOOK (ELEMENTS OF INFINITY-CATEGORY THEORY, JOINT WITH VERITY), LECTURES DIRECTED AT THE GENERAL PUBLIC, SURVEY ARTICLES PREPARED FOR A VARIETY OF AUDIENCES, AND EFFORTS TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO ADVANCED MATHEMATICS, SUCH AS HER SERVICE ON THE EQUITY, DIVERSITY, AND INCLUSION ADVISORY BOARD AT THE BANFF INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH STATION. THE PIONEERS OF HOMOTOPY TYPE THEORY - THE NEW PROPOSED UNIVALENT FOUNDATION SYSTEM - ENVISIONED A COMPUTER-VERIFIABLE FOUNDATION FOR INFINITE-DIMENSIONAL CATEGORY THEORY, BUT SOME COMPUTATIONAL CONTENT IS LOST THROUGH THE CLASSICAL REASONING USED IN CLASSICAL HOMOTOPY THEORY. WITH COLLABORATORS, THE PI WILL DEVELOP A NEW MODEL FOR CLASSICAL HOMOTOPY THEORY IN A PARTICULAR CATEGORY OF CUBICAL SETS, IN WHICH CUBICAL FIBRATIONS ARE REQUIRED TO BE EQUIVARIANT, RESPECTING THE SYMMETRIES OF CUBES DEFINED BY PERMUTING THEIR DIMENSIONS. A LONGER-TERM AIM IS TO USE SIMILAR METHODS TO OBTAIN CUBICAL SET BASED PRESENTATIONS OF ALL INFINITY-TOPOI. A COMPUTER PROOF ASSISTANT BASED ON EQUIVARIANT CUBICAL FIBRATIONS WOULD HAVE THE CORRECT CLASSICAL SEMANTICS BUT WOULD BE ABLE TO RESTORE THE COMPUTATIONAL CONTENT TO UNIVALENT MATHEMATICS. A FINAL PROJECT EXPLORES HOMOTOPICAL MACROCOSMS FOR HIGHER CATEGORY THEORY, AIMING TO PROVE THAT THE COLLECTION OF CARTESIAN FIBRATIONS BETWEEN (INFINITY,N)-CATEGORIES ASSEMBLE INTO A CARTESIAN FIBRATION OF (INFINITY,N+1)-CATEGORIES, WHICH CAN BE REGARDED AS SOME SORT OF CATEGORIFIED HYPERDOCTRINE FOR (INFINITY,N)-CATEGORY THEORY. RESULTS OF THIS NATURE WOULD ESTABLISH A GLOBAL LIFTING PROPERTY AGAINST HOMOTOPY COHERENT DIAGRAMS THAT SHOULD AID FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS IN (INFINITY,N)-CATEGORY THEORY. THIS AWARD REFLECTS NSF'S STATUTORY MISSION AND HAS BEEN DEEMED WORTHY OF SUPPORT THROUGH EVALUATION USING THE FOUNDATION'S INTELLECTUAL MERIT AND BROADER IMPACTS REVIEW CRITERIA.</p>\n</blockquote>",

These agreements include terms and conditions that are required to be met by the grantee in order for the grantee to be in compliance with federal statutory and regulatory provisions. When the grantee is found to be in noncompliance with the terms and conditions of a federal grant award, the grantee may be required to return the funds to the federal government. The process by which a federal agency seeks repayment of expended funds for noncompliance is known as recoupment where the federal government is seeking to recoup funds previously paid to the grantee. Recoupment processes are sometimes called grant funding clawbacks since the federal government is taking back previously awarded funding.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is happening: the USG is taking granted money back out of accounts.</p>",

A CENTRAL CHALLENGE IS TO CLASSIFY ALL MAPS FROM SPHERES TO OTHER SPHERES, WHERE TWO MAPS ARE CONSIDERED EQUIVALENT IF ONE CAN BE DEFORMED TO THE OTHER. THE EQUIVALENCE CLASSES OF THESE MAPS ARE CALLED THE HOMOTOPY GROUPS OF SPHERES, AND COLLECTIVELY THEY FORM ONE OF THE DEEPEST AND MOST CENTRAL OBJECTS IN THE FIELD. HISTORICALLY, MUCH IMPORTANT THEORY HAS ARISEN OUT OF ATTEMPTS TO COMPUTE MORE HOMOTOPY GROUPS OF SPHERES AND UNDERSTAND PATTERNS WITHIN THEM. THIS PROJECT INVOLVES FURTHERING KNOWLEDGE OF THE HOMOTOPY GROUPS OF SPHERES, USING OLD AND NEW TECHNIQUES AS WELL AS COMPUTER CALCULATIONS. THE PROJECT ALSO INVOLVES STUDYING AN ANALOGUE OF THESE GROUPS IN ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY; THIS FALLS UNDER A RELATIVELY NEW AND ACTIVELY DEVELOPED AREA CALLED MOTIVIC HOMOTOPY THEORY, WHICH APPLIES TECHNIQUES IN ALGEBRAIC TOPOLOGY TO STUDY ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY. THE BROADER IMPACTS OF THIS PROJECT CENTER AROUND SUPPORTING THE LOCAL MATHEMATICS COMMUNITY THROUGH MENTORING AND PROMOTING DIVERSITY. THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR WILL HELP BUILD THE NASCENT HOMOTOPY THEORY COMMUNITY AT THE UNIVERSITY AND PROMOTE WOMEN AND MINORITIES IN THE SUBJECT THROUGH SEMINAR ORGANIZATION AND MENTORING. ONE OF THE MAIN PLANNED PROJECTS IS A LARGE-SCALE EFFORT TO COMPUTE THE HOMOTOPY GROUPS OF SPHERES AT THE PRIME 3 IN A RANGE, USING OLD AND NEW TECHNIQUES SUCH AS THE ADAMS-NOVIKOV SPECTRAL SEQUENCE AS WELL AS INFINITE DESCENT MACHINERY. THIS WORK WILL BE AIDED BY COMPUTER CALCULATIONS, WHICH SHORT-CIRCUITS SOME OF THE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED IN PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS. ANOTHER MAIN GROUP OF PROJECTS CONCERNS COMPUTING THE ANALOGUE OF THE STABLE HOMOTOPY GROUPS OF SPHERES IN THE WORLD OF R-MOTIVIC HOMOTOPY THEORY. THIS REPRESENTS A CONTINUATION OF PRIOR WORK OF THE PI AND COLLABORATOR; THE PLAN IS TO SUPPLEMENT THE TECHNIQUES USED IN THAT WORK WITH COMPUTER CALCULATIONS AND A NEW TOOL, THE SLICE SPECTRAL SEQUENCE. A THIRD PROJECT CONCERNS THEORY AND SPECTRAL SEQUENCE COMPUTATIONS AIMED AT COMPUTING THE COHOMOLOGY OF PROFINITE GROUPS SUCH AS SPECIAL LINEAR GROUPS AND MORAVA STABILIZER GROUPS.

They did a naive text search on grant proposals, and didn't check the results:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/only-about-40-of-the-cruz-woke-science\">Only about 40% of the Cruz \"woke science\" database is woke science</a>, <em>Astral Codex Ten</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A quote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I saw many scientists <a href=\"https://x.com/HermanPontzer/status/1890059071140815282\">complain</a> that the projects from their universities that made Cruz’s list were unrelated to wokeness. This seemed like a surprising failure mode, so I decided to investigate. The Commerce Department provided a link to their database, so I downloaded it, chose a random 100 grants, read the abstracts, and rated them either woke, not woke, or borderline.</p>\n<p>Of the hundred:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>40% were woke</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>20% were borderline</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>40% weren’t woke</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is obviously in some sense a subjective determination, but most cases weren’t close - I think any good-faith examination would turn up similar numbers.</p>\n<p>Why would a list of woke grants have so many non-woke grants in it? After reading the hundred abstracts, I found a clear answer: people inserted a meaningless sentence saying “this could help women and minorities” into unrelated grants, probably in the hopes of getting points with some automated filter.</p>\n<p>For example, from Grant 1731:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>New Security Exploit in Energy Harvesting Systems and Its Countermeasures:</em> An Energy Harvesting System (EHS) has emerged as an alternative to battery-operated Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Instead of using a battery, EHS self-powers its device by collecting ambient energy from external sources such as radio frequency, WiFi, etc. However, since such ambient energy sources are unreliable, their resulting power is inherently unstable and often goes out. To address the problem, EHS leverages a capacitor as an energy buffer and computes when the capacitor secures a sufficient amount of energy, i.e., capacitors are at the heart of any EHS devices. Unfortunately, capacitors can be unreliable in the presence of frequent power failure across which they continuously charge and discharge, losing their original capacitance over time. More importantly, attackers can exploit the capacitor reliability issue to cause incorrect outputs or degrade the quality of service in targeted EHS devices. To this end, this research project focuses on investigating attack surfaces and designing cost-effective countermeasures. The project outcome will lay the foundation for batteryless Internet of Things services by maintaining their quality of service and security. The project also aims to integrate research findings into undergraduate teaching and promote equitable outcomes for women in computer science through K-12 outreach program.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Did you catch the last sentence?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The project also aims to integrate research findings into undergraduate teaching and promote equitable outcomes for women in computer science through K-12 outreach program.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some version of this sentence was in most of the nonwoke grants that made it into Cruz’s database. They promised to investigate some totally normal scientific topic, and then at the end they said somehow it would cause equity for women and minorities. I assume somebody told them that if they didn’t include this sentence, the Biden NSF would ding them for not having enough equity impact.</p>\n<p>Typical examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We will do outreach, and probably some of it will inspire underrepresented minorities to go into STEM.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We will employ undergraduates or PhD students, and probably some of them will be underrepresented minorities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>People will benefit from our work, and probably some of the beneficiaries will be underrepresented minorities.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This was probably 90% of the false positives. But there were other categories, including grants that accidentally used scientific terms that had alternative woke meanings. For example, Grant 1424:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Cis-Regulatory Basis of Developmental Plasticity and Growth in the Development and Evolution of Beetle Horns, a Class of Highly Diversified Weapons</em> - This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY22, integrative research investigating the rules of life governing interactions between genomes, environment and phenotypes. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. How organisms develop is regulated through the interactions of genes and environmental conditions like nutrition. Gene regulation (turning genes \"on\" or \"off\") therefore is an important point of control for many aspects of development, such as growth. Further, when gene regulation is modified by evolution, it can lead to the emergence of new traits. Yet, exactly how gene regulation is controlled is not fully understood. The fellow will research horned beetles, which are well known for their diverse forms of environment-dependent development, in order to understand how environment affects gene regulation to promote diversity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This one gets off to a rocky start by mentioning the word “cis” (a cis-regulatory pathway is when genes regulate the expression of other genes on the same DNA molecule). Then it ends with the words “promote diversity” - in context referring to how genes promote a diversity of beetle phenotypes, but probably this looks bad in a simple CTRL+F search.</p>\n</blockquote>",

My question is: Do you think this was right in the first place? To me, it seems that the general idea of 'having to align with/subscribe to some political program/agenda/topic to get money' is shortsighted, and basically wrong. It has no political effect really, as a lot of people will squeeze whatever fashionable opinion in to get extra points, without caring an inch about it. It also has no positive long-term incentive as in doing so, one has to factor in that the political climate may shift and said stuff will inevitably backfire.</p>\n<p>I think it would be much better for academics, institutions, universities and the entire research ecosystem if math grants would be about maths, and maths only. This said I<strong> clearly don't agree with Trump's policies even a little bit</strong> (I can't believe I have to write it explicitly), but at least I hope people will be mindful about the consequences of squeezing politics into anything the next time they have to submit some application.</p>",

In Australia, we don't have an NSF, we have the Australian Research Council, which is something like the complement of the NIH - it covers all non-clinical basic/fundamental research. So you have maths and physics and chemistry and engineering and history and philosophy and .... all funded by the same body. One of the things that is necessary to do is add some statement about the benefit to Australia more broadly rather than just one's own field. It used to be worse (imposed by the centre-right government of the time) in that it was a non-negligible part of the process, even if relatively small.</p>\n<p>This part of the grant has to be reflected in the one-paragraph public summary, which is the analogue of the stuff we are seeing above from the NSF grants.</p>\n<p>So you get inanities like \"This will have benefits within mathematics and also <strong>in physics/chemistry in the long run.</strong>\" in a grant about tensor categories (this is a small one, because the people applying are big shots are half of them outside Australia) or \"Expected outcomes include flexible techniques for constructing twisted algebras for use further along the research pipeline, and cross-pollination of ideas within mathematics. <strong>Benefits include enhanced international collaboration and increased Australian capacity in pure mathematics, particularly algebra and operator algebras</strong>.\" on a grant linking categories and operator algebras. You cannot get away from including this, it's not a matter of some kind of vague social expectation. Here's one on a mathematics of string theory grant: \"Significant benefits include bringing leading international researchers to Australia, cutting-edge research outcomes and research training in high-profile international collaborations.\"</p>\n<p>This is to my mind one of the silliest parts of the application, because nearly everyone in pure maths has to put in some bland slop, because there almost always <em>simply isn't anything that fits the bill</em>. These 'benefit statements' are so small because the whole piece looks like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Character sheaves and Langlands duality. In the recent years a large part of mathematics has been driven by the Langlands program. The aim of work proposed is to contribute to this program from our unique point of view. The expected outcomes include a comprehensive understanding of character sheaves and how they apply to longstanding difficult problems in mathematics. In addition to addressing fundamental questions in mathematics and expanding our understanding, the research program connects Australia to the most exciting recent mathematical developments thus benefiting Australian researchers and students. The project will also train highly qualified individuals who can make significant impact on science, industry, technology, and economy through their specialised skills.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These paragraphs are what the Government Minister in charge of the ARC in principle could look at before giving the final approval to the awarding of the grants. Thankfully this is not the process any more, but it used to be the Minister could veto grants based on the short paragraph as I quoted.

On the other hand you have a bunch of projects that need resources to be carried over. If the funding requested is more than the money available (read: always), you have the typical allocation problem, namely: what do I fund?<br>\nFrom the grant-giving perspective (the organism allocating funding), one could rank projects according to various parameters: One parameter could be impact (how good does the project do?). The other could be risk (what are the probabilities that the project actually delivers?). If you go back a few years (ex-post reasoning is obviously easier), on one hand of the spectrum you have, for instance, building a hospital (decent positive impact, all things considered low risk). On the other hand of the spectrum you have funding AI research (potentially huge impact, very high risk it goes nowhere).</p>\n<p>In absolute layman terms, the higher the risk, the less percentage of the budget should go into it (or the highest the need to hedge the high-risk allocation with something else). What matters is that budget allocation according to risk is one of the most studied fields of practical economics, and we have all sort of techniques to allocate funding to maximize impact when risk is known. <br>\n...The other most studied field of practical economics is probably 'risk assessment'. There are, especially, a lot of techniques to assess the risk of projects that have a potentially big, but really not-so-clear impact, like, for instance, the impact of some super novel category theory to some field of engineering in n decades.</p>\n<p>All in all what I'm saying is that we have developed, over the last 5-6 decades or so, a lot of tools to be really good at allocating budgets for research, and to evaluate research for what it is, without the need of any far-fetched, hyperbolic claims.

The work of open access advocates to directly persuade academics to sort out their own open access was at best a very limited success, so the focus switched to promoting the idea to funding bodies, who have slowly come around to the idea.

Also, the success rates of funding a rather low. Sean Carroll mentioned a 50% success rate for the NSF funding panel he was on. For the ARC it's more like 16%, and even though there's no \"pay for my summer salary, plz\" effect here, universities (at least, research universities I am familiar with) compel people to apply for grants regularly as part of their KPIs; essentially, if you don't have one, you need to apply for one every year until you do.

Some will say \"oh but anybody could do that, her expertise is not needed\", and I hear them but disagree: the little things she chooses to emphasize I think are quite important from a certain perspective.  As she says somewhere in there, this is a math problem... without any numbers!  That's quite novel for most of her younger viewers, I suspect, and the kind of insight your average popularizer without the depth in pure theory, seems less likely to make.</p>\n<p>The ongoing disaster in the US highlights in part the importance of social bonds across class, and what happens when they are not maintained.  I think it is important for scientists, including those doing even very abstract mathematics, to stay connected to this kind of thing and be proactive about engagement.  Wether or not the risk-metrics are really well-calibrated or not, keeping the public engaged in STEM is absolutely crucial for fighting back against efforts to undervalue science.  There was a time in the US when being a land-grant school meant something in terms of the work done at that school: it was agriculture related, the farmers actually <em>used</em> the research on some level.  When Dick Feynman put an O-ring in a glass of ice water he was standing up as a kind of \"clever everyman\" against the suits and bureaucrats who tried to sweep Challenger under the rug.  He was taking great pains to avoid being seen talking down to people as an \"expert\", or excluding them.</p>\n<p>The blessing of government funded research is that it greatly increases the kinds of problems that can be worked on.  The danger of publicly funded research is that it gets all the experts talking to each-other on peer-reviewed panels, which is much more efficient and effective at certain ends, but inherently disconnects them from the public and industry, or at least risks doing so.  We have entered an age of populist authoritarianism, and things are going to get worse before they get better.  Many excellent people are going to have to reach outside of the usual grant system in order to get their work funded in the coming decades.  I may be preaching to the choir here, but I encourage everyone looking with concern at the funding situation in your country to embrace the discomfort and engage outside of the traditional systems.</p>",

Fascism is in essence an agrarian fantasy: the “sheaves” in the historical symbol of “fascism” hinting to an essentially rural idealization of society, rejecting complexity and urban modernity, pandering a mythological image of an unspecified past whose return is to be sought. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is true of the later Fascism movement and Nazism, but Fascism has its roots in Italian Futurism, that, as the term says, it is quite literally the opposite. People like Marinetti or D'Annunzio idealized modern technology like the car (just read the Futurist Manifesto if you have doubts), and in today's term they would be identified as staunch accelerationists. Their political idea was indeed to use any mean (violent or not, that is) to enact an accelerationist revolution.<br>\nIndeed, many of the 'revolutionary fascists' of the first period (including Marinetti and D'Annunzio) were completely dismayed, saddened and disgusted with what fascism became in the second period (agrarian dream, strong clericalism, basically the opposite of what it was in the beginning), to the point of either being exiled, or going to exile by themselves (see D'Annunzio being basically confined in the Vittoriale).</p>",

        "content": "<p>If you want a simple, well-known, generally shared definition of what the ideological core of Fascism is, I suggest to go with Umberto Eco's one (totally not a fan of the guy, but this analysis is quite good):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"The cult of tradition\", characterized by cultural syncretism, even at the risk of internal contradiction. When all truth has already been revealed by tradition, no new learning can occur, only further interpretation and refinement.</li>\n<li>\"The rejection of modernism\", which views the rationalistic development of Western culture since the Enlightenment as a descent into depravity. Eco distinguishes this from a rejection of superficial technological advancement, as many fascist regimes cite their industrial potency as proof of the vitality of their system.</li>\n<li>\"The cult of action for action's sake\", which dictates that action is of value in itself and should be taken without intellectual reflection. This, says Eco, is connected with anti-intellectualism and irrationalism, and often manifests in attacks on modern culture and science.</li>\n<li>\"Disagreement is treason\" – fascism devalues intellectual discourse and critical reasoning as barriers to action, as well as out of fear that such analysis will expose the contradictions embodied in a syncretistic faith.</li>\n<li>\"Fear of difference\", which fascism seeks to exploit and exacerbate, often in the form of racism or an appeal against foreigners and immigrants.</li>\n<li>\"Appeal to a frustrated middle class\", fearing economic pressure from the demands and aspirations of lower social groups.</li>\n<li>\"Obsession with a plot\" and the hyping-up of an enemy threat. This often combines an appeal to xenophobia with a fear of disloyalty and sabotage from marginalized groups living within the society. Eco also cites Pat Robertson's book The New World Order as a prominent example of a plot obsession.</li>\n<li>Fascist societies rhetorically cast their enemies as \"at the same time too strong and too weak\". On the one hand, fascists play up the power of certain disfavored elites to encourage in their followers a sense of grievance and humiliation. On the other hand, fascist leaders point to the decadence of those elites as proof of their ultimate feebleness in the face of an overwhelming popular will.</li>\n<li>\"Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy\" because \"life is permanent warfare\" – there must always be an enemy to fight. Both fascist Germany under Hitler and Italy under Mussolini worked first to organize and clean up their respective countries and then build the war machines that they later intended to and did use, despite Germany being under restrictions of the Versailles treaty to not build a military force. This principle leads to a fundamental contradiction within fascism: the incompatibility of ultimate triumph with perpetual war.</li>\n<li>\"Contempt for the weak\", which is uncomfortably married to a chauvinistic popular elitism, in which every member of society is superior to outsiders by virtue of belonging to the in-group. Eco sees in these attitudes the root of a deep tension in the fundamentally hierarchical structure of fascist polities, as they encourage leaders to despise their underlings, up to the ultimate leader, who holds the whole country in contempt for having allowed him to overtake it by force.</li>\n<li>\"Everybody is educated to become a hero\", which leads to the embrace of a cult of death. As Eco observes, \"[t]he Ur-Fascist hero is impatient to die. In his impatience, he more frequently sends other people to death.\"</li>\n<li>\"Machismo\", which sublimates the difficult work of permanent war and heroism into the sexual sphere. Fascists thus hold \"both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality\".</li>\n<li>\"Selective populism\" – the people, conceived monolithically, have a common will, distinct from and superior to the viewpoint of any individual. As no mass of people can ever be truly unanimous, the leader holds himself out as the interpreter of the popular will (though truly he alone dictates it). Fascists use this concept to delegitimize democratic institutions they accuse of \"no longer represent[ing] the voice of the people\".</li>\n<li>\"Newspeak\" – fascism employs and promotes an impoverished vocabulary in order to limit critical reasoning.</li>\n</ul>",

In such a framework ideology is probably more performative than anything else.

Yes, but when you look closer, you see that average salaries/income went up very little, whereas billionaires made a BOATLOAD of money.

That egregore uses ideology, be it futurist/fascist/communist/utopianist/whatever like an anglerfish uses its lure: a bright shiny bauble to lure in the unsuspecting bright-eyed youth and idealists.  Then two processes: a sort of digestion of society through demoralizing actions and rhetoric and violence, and also an escalation of privileges to move past the idealists to reach the more cynical and more powerfully-placed.  Once oligarchs (or some other powerful group) are onside/co-opted with this transformation, you get decapitation strikes, coups, and the ultimate betrayal of the very people and concepts the ideology-lure originally drew in.  Then the <em>really bad</em> stuff starts...  <a href=\"https://www.maksymeristavi.com/about\">Maksim Erisatvi</a>'s bleak three-word summary of this process is apropos.  </p>\n<p>IMO the more our societies are still in denial about ugliness in our own past, say colonialism or racial violence for instance, the easier this becomes: if you are emotionally committed to avoiding uncomfortable truths, you become easier to deceive or corrupt, all while perceiving yourself a victim.  As my Irish family says \"The Past is very unpredictable.\"  In this sense science can be useful or a detriment to the egregore digesting society: a detriment because science seeks truth and openness, but useful if its productive capacity can be maintained while practitioners are lured into a distracted state of unhealthy skepticism and detail-orientation, where we cannot see the dark forest growing around us for the details of the trees.</p>\n<p>Returning to Amar's point, this is to say that this perception of the \"enemy\" being simultaneously \"too weak and too strong\" is so common, perhaps, because it really is picking up on something.  Rarely is it to do with the specified enemy (often a red herring) actually being this way, but with demoralization and the nature of the more sinister forms of power.  We are in a liminal time in which we no longer accurately perceive what power and strength are.  People and organizations that by the standards of the old era seem weak or hopelessly incompetent, or self-destructively toxic, etc. are able to pull off coups and inflict tremendous damage from a position of \"weakness\", precisely because they are applying <em>different types of strength</em>.  So long as we fail to perceive these forms of strength as they are, we exist in a state of confusion.  In such a state, perhaps by Yoneda, the misattribution of paradoxical qualities to others merely witnesses this internal paradox.</p>",

I'm quoting from wiki: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Energy has played a crucial role throughout human history. Energy is linked to the birth, growth, and decline of each and every society. Energy surplus is required for the division of labor and the growth of cities. Massive energy surplus is needed for widespread wealth and cultural amenities. Economic prospects fluctuate in tandem with a society's access to cheap and abundant energy.</p>\n<p>Political scientist Thomas Homer-Dixon and ecologist Charles Hall proposed an economic model called energy return on investment (EROI), which measures the amount of surplus energy a society gets from using energy to obtain energy.[85][86] Energy shortages drive up prices and as such provide an incentive to explore and extract previously uneconomical sources, which may still be plentiful, but more energy would be required, and the EROI is then not as high as initially thought.[84]</p>\n<p>There would be no surplus if EROI approaches 1:1. Hall showed that the real cutoff is well above that and estimated that 3:1 to sustain the essential overhead energy costs of a modern society. The EROI of the most preferred energy source, petroleum, has fallen in the past century from 100:1 to the range of 10:1 with clear evidence that the natural depletion curves all are downward decay curves. An EROI of more than ~3 then is what appears necessary to provide the energy for socially important tasks, such as maintaining government, legal and financial institutions, a transportation infrastructure, manufacturing, building construction and maintenance, and the lifestyles of all members of a given society.[86] </p>\n</blockquote>",

UnitedHealth Group, MLB, Victoria’s Secret, Warner Bros. Discovery, Goldman Sachs, Paramount, Bank of America, BlackRock, Citigroup, Pepsi, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Coca-Cola, Deloitte, PBS, Google, Disney, GE, PayPal, Chipotle, Target and others scaled back or canceled their DEI programs even before April.   </p>\n<p>But Trump also signed two executive orders banning federal agencies from contracting with companies that embrace DEI policies.  An example is LinkedIn: federal agencies dropped millions of dollars in contracts for LinkedIn services.</p>\n<p>Then judges started issuing injunctions trying to stop the Trump administration from doing this.  Here's <a href=\"https://www.callaborlaw.com/entry/federal-court-puts-brakes-on-trump-era-dei-ban-for-contractors-what-california-employers-need-to-know\">a story</a> from April 22nd:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Federal courts continue to navigate the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (“DEI”) landscape including Executive Orders targeting DEI. In a recent development last week, U.S. District Judge Matthew Kennelly granted a preliminary injunction against the United States Department of Labor (“DOL”) from enforcing the Executive Order titled “<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing/\">Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing</a>” issued by President Trump on January 20, 2025 that effectively bans DEI programs for federal contractors and grantees.</p>\n<p>The ruling in <em><a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/chicago-trade-group-wins-injunction-against-dei-grant-terminations.pdf\">Chicago Women in Trades v. Trump (N.D. Ill., No. 1:25-cv-2005)</a></em> extends a prior temporary restraining order, concluding that requiring contractors to certify non-participation in DEI programs likely violates their First Amendment rights. There, Chicago Women in Trades, a nonprofit that provides job training to women, challenged the requirement for contractors to certify that they do not operate DEI programs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's not clear the Trump administration will follow the judge's orders.</p>\n<p>Threats to federal funding for the University of California made my university flip-flop.    Until recently, UC required that any candidate for an open position write a \"DEI statement\" describing what they've done in support of diversity, equity and inclusion.  There were required courses for faculty on how to read and evaluate such statements.  Now there's a policy that <em>bans</em> the use of DEI statements.   The mandatory has become forbidden.</p>\n<p>So far I'm not sure of pressure beyond words and \"the power of the purse\", but I expect that when the low-hanging fruit is picked, the pressure will increase on any remaining holdouts.  E.g. the Republicans could pass laws that forbid DEI (based on their usual argument that it's a form of discrimination).</p>",

There are a lot of people that would like to get there, or getting equivalent status. How do you do that? Historically there is a \"cursus honorum\" that brought people there, e.g. \"get a degree from Oxbridge\" was a pretty good starting point. So people pursued those careers, often exactly with the _expectation_ of being able to join said elite. So now you have a lot of Harvard graduates from whatever background that, say, try to join some hedge fund. Many of them won't be able tho, because demand is too high, and will have to go for something else. This creates lower and lower tiers of alternatives and, in the end, you'll have people that \"I did all that I did to be part of this elite, and instead I end up working a shit job that doesn't respect all the effort I put into building my career nor my expectations\". And that's 'elite overproduction' for you.</p>",

I guess people call that \"reasoning from theory\".   Now I'd like to understand how the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Age\">Gilded Age</a> ended.  </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>From 1860 to 1900, the wealthiest 2% of American households owned more than a third of the nation's wealth, while the top 10% owned roughly three-quarters of it.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Age#cite_note-61\">[61]</a> The bottom 40% had no wealth at all.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Age#cite_note-Fraser-5\">[5]</a> In terms of property, the wealthiest 1% owned 51%, while the bottom 44% claimed 1.1%.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But what happened?   It seems there was a rise in labor unions, and a lot of violent attempts to suppress them:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Starting in the mid-1880s a new group, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_of_Labor\">Knights of Labor</a>, grew too rapidly, and it spun out of control and failed to handle the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Southwest_Railroad_Strike_of_1886\">Great Southwest Railroad Strike of 1886</a>. The Knights avoided violence, but their reputation collapsed in the wake of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haymarket_affair\">Haymarket Square Riot in Chicago in 1886</a>, when anarchists allegedly bombed the policemen dispersing a meeting.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Age#cite_note-75\">[75]</a> Police then randomly fired into the crowd, killing and wounding a number of people, including other police, and arbitrarily rounded up anarchists, including leaders of the movement. Seven anarchists went on trial. Four were hanged even though no evidence directly linked them to the bombing.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Age#cite_note-TindallShe596-76\">[76]</a> One had in his possession a Knights of Labor membership card.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Age#cite_note-TindallShe596-76\">[76]</a> At its peak, the Knights claimed 700,000 members. By 1890, membership had plummeted to fewer than 100,000, then faded away.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Age#cite_note-77\">[77]</a></p>\n<p>Strikes organized by labor unions became routine events by the 1880s as the gap between the rich and the poor widened.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Age#cite_note-78\">[78]</a> There were 37,000 strikes from 1881 to 1905. By far the largest number were in the building trades, followed far behind by coal miners. The main goal was control of working conditions and settling which rival union was in control. Most were of very short duration. In times of depression strikes were more violent but less successful, because the company was losing money anyway. They were successful in times of prosperity when the company was losing profits and wanted to settle quickly.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Age#cite_note-79\">[79]</a></p>\n<p>The largest and most dramatic strike was the 1894 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pullman_Strike\">Pullman Strike</a>, a coordinated effort to shut down the national railroad system. The strike was led by the upstart <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Railway_Union\">American Railway Union</a> led by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Debs\">Eugene V. Debs</a> and was not supported by the established brotherhoods. The union defied federal court orders to stop blocking the mail trains, so President Cleveland used the U.S. Army to get the trains moving again. The ARU vanished and the traditional railroad brotherhoods survived but avoided strikes.[<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Age#cite_note-80\">8</a>]</p>\n</blockquote>",

One of these is Georgism, which I find very intriguing: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism</a></p>\n<p>The idea of Georgism is very simple: Active income (e.g. the profit stemming from work) should be taxed very lightly, or none at all, whereas passive income (e.g. profit from renting land, revenue bering assets etc.) should be taxed heavily. I tend to agree with this position, as what makes the ultra rich so rich is precisely the vast accumulation of assets and property that generate passive income, esp. across generations. So basically you can stop working and do nothing, and you'll still end up generating more wealth than average Joe working a lot.</p>\n<p>Since as I said some posts earlier money is not value, but a tool to determine how resources are allocated, this makes all the resources go to the superwealthy, leaving everyone else with very little. Now, I do not believe that being stinking rich is per sé morally bad, but I believe that wealth should be the fruit of one's work, and so I find the idea of getting passive revenue kinda unfair, esp if the passive-revenue bearing assets are inherited. Moreover, the productivity of society as a whole is inherently related to how much and how well people work, so a societal system that puts \"passive income earning\" above \"get rich by working your ass off\" is inherently doomed to slip into stagnation and decadence in my personal view.</p>",

You run into all kinds of people complaining about granny whose Bay Area home is suddenly worth $3M when it was $7500 when she bought it in 1948 and she has no way to pay the taxes, and thus has to move to Wyoming or whatever. This is to some extent solvable, and indeed everywhere already assesses a certain amount of property tax; so are you basically just advocating for higher/more progressive property taxes with this point? This also does feel like it's stepping a bit towards Georgism, whose central thesis is that the <em>most</em> immobile asset is the unimproved value of land, and so that's the best thing to tax.</p>",

I agree with all these points. I also like Georgism from a moral pov: If you get rich from your own work, you kinda deserve it. What is less deserved is getting rich out of extractive practices such as rent seeking. Taxing land and similar assets has the effect of taxing extractive practices, and one can use this money to actually lower taxes on work, making society as a whole more productive. That taxing land is a good thing has been understood and advocated for by a lot of economists, notably even by people considered points of reference in the neoliberal school such as Adam Smith and Milton Friedman.</p>",

Apple, despite knowing its obligations thereunder, thwarted the Injunction’s goals, and continued its anticompetitive conduct solely to maintain its revenue stream.  Remarkably, Apple believed that this Court would not see through its obvious cover-up (the 2024 evidentiary hearing). To unveil Apple’s actual decision-making process, not the one tailor-made for litigation, the Court ordered production of real-time documents and ultimately held a second set of hearings in 2025. </p>\n<p>To summarize: <em>One</em>, after trial, the Court found that Apple’s 30 percent commission “allowed it to reap supracompetitive operating margins” and was not tied to the value of its intellectual property, and thus, was anticompetitive. Apple’s response: charge a 27 percent commission (again tied to nothing) on off-app purchases, where it had previously charged nothing, and extend the commission for a period of seven days after the consumer linked-out of the app. Apple’s goal: maintain its anticompetitive revenue stream. <em>Two</em>, the Court had prohibited Apple from denying developers the ability to communicate with, and direct consumers to, other purchasing mechanisms. Apple’s response: impose <em>new</em> barriers and <em>new</em> requirements to increase friction and increase breakage rates with full page “scare” screens, static URLs, and generic statements. Apple’s goal: to dissuade customer usage of alternative purchase opportunities and maintain its anticompetitive revenue stream. In the end, Apple sought to maintain a revenue stream worth billions in direct defiance of this Court’s Injunction.  In stark contrast to Apple’s initial in-court testimony, contemporaneous business documents reveal that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option. </p>\n<p>To hide the truth, Vice-President of Finance, Alex Roman, outright lied under oath.</p>\n</blockquote>",

In this talk, Riehl shares her journey as a queer mathematician, tracing the formation of a pair of identities that were more often developed in parallel rather than fully integrated. In addition she will explore the recent \"queering\" of the concept of \"identity\" in mathematics, which enables a more expansive notion of mathematical equality than appears in traditional mathematical foundations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>About the speaker: Emily Riehl has established herself as a leading expert in higher category theory and has also developed an interest in connections with computer science such as homotopy type theory. She is an accomplished and enthusiastic expositor of mathematics at a variety of levels aimed at mathematicians as well as popular writing with articles in Scientific American and New Scientist. She also plays a leading role in broader engagement of mathematicians and other scientists from marginalized and discriminated against groups. Emily played Australian Rules football for the US national team and is an accomplished musician.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>About the lectureship: The LMS Hardy Lectureship is named after G.H. Hardy, former President of the Society and De Morgan Medallist. Originally awarded to a distinguished overseas mathematician in odd-numbered years.</p>\n</blockquote>",
