In this context, it may be relevant to consider <a href=\"https://playinmath.wordpress.com/2022/12/04/grassmanns-theory-of-pedagogy/\">Grassmann’s theory of pedagogy</a>, along with the role of <a href=\"https://conceptualmathematics.wordpress.com/2024/10/28/explicit-foundational-concepts-in-the-teaching-of-mathematics/\">foundational concepts</a> and the not quite a happy <a href=\"https://playinmath.wordpress.com/2023/02/08/history-and-philosophy-of-mathematic-reform/\">history of MathEd</a>.</p>\n<p>I think of <a href=\"https://conceptualmathematics.medium.com/teaching-8a5b00bcc3a9\">teaching as learning-with-students</a>.  After every lecture / course, I ask: how did my understanding of the subject <a href=\"https://philpeople.org/feed_items/375015442\">change</a> as <a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/POSTSP-2\">a result of teaching the same subject yet again</a>; <a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/9u7sx\">did I learn anything</a> more?

I thought of adding something closer to our home turf: a number, say 1969, can be thought of as a function with places and values as domain and codomain sets, respectively.  Functions, in turn, can be thought of as a subcategory of graphs (target = source).  With numbers as loops, we have an interesting situation from the Lawvere &amp; Schanuel <a href=\"https://conceptualmathematics.substack.com/p/mathematicians-mathematician\">Objective Number Theory</a> with analogs in graphs, all of which reminded me of Professor Charles Wells: <a href=\"https://conceptualmathematics.substack.com/p/if-blah-then-blah-blah-mathematical-definitions?utm_source=publication-search\">The way you can word a definition affects the properties of the thing defined.</a></p>",
