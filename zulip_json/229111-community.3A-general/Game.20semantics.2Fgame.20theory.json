Could you clarify how the definition of <a href=\"https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo:M#mipstar\" title=\"https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo:M#mipstar\">MIP*</a> is game-semantic but not game-theoretic in nature? Per the definitions in the Complexity Zoo:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>MIP*: MIP With Quantum Provers</strong></p>\n<p>Same as MIP, except that the provers can share arbitrarily many entangled qubits. The verifier is classical, as are all messages between the provers and verifier.</p>\n<p><strong>MIP: Multi-Prover Interactive Proof</strong></p>\n<p>Same as IP, except that now the verifier can exchange messages with many provers, not just one. The provers cannot communicate with each other during the execution of the protocol, so the verifier can \"cross-check\" their assertions (as with suspects in separate interrogation rooms).</p>\n<p><strong>IP: Interactive Proof Systems</strong></p>\n<p>The class of decision problems for which a \"yes\" answer can be verified by an interactive proof. Here a probabilistic polynomial-time verifier sends messages back and forth with an all-powerful prover. They can have polynomially many rounds of interaction. Given the verifier's algorithm, at the end:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>If the answer is \"yes,\" the prover must be able to behave in such a way that the verifier accepts with probability at least 2/3 (over the choice of the verifier's random bits).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If the answer is \"no,\" then however the prover behaves the verifier must reject with probability at least 2/3.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>",
