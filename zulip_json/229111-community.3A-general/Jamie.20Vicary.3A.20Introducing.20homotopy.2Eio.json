He adds that proofs in this setting would resemble manipulations of (higher-dimensional analogues of) proof-nets with units.  Does anyone know of more fleshed-out work that takes this view? Are there already combinatorial structures that captures precisely this level of weakness? Maybe <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"276363\">@Amar Hadzihasanovic</span> or <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"276320\">@Antonin Delpeuch</span> have some idea? (Sorry if this is a rather naive question but considering the many different approaches to higher-categories I am not sure where to start looking).</p>",
