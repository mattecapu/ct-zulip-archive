Zulip has recently added support for \"web-public streams\", which means certain streams can be viewed online for users without an account (though people cannot post anonymously). We're going to be making some of the streams web-public to make the Category Theory Zulip more accessible. However, we will not be making public any of the streams that are not currently archived, nor will any private streams become viewable. You can tell which streams are web-public because they will have a globe icon instead of the usual hash symbol. <a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/Xv8qs2Ydipr9bSG3NTHVb6dM/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/Xv8qs2Ydipr9bSG3NTHVb6dM/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/21317/Xv8qs2Ydipr9bSG3NTHVb6dM/image.png\"></a></div>",
