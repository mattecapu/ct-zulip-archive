        "content": "<p>EDIT: while I was writing this lecture, Amar made some of the same points, in short and suitable ways :-)</p>\n<p>It should be noted that Voevodsky talks about two different mistakes, of different mathematical nature, and occurring in <em>very</em> different sociological contexts.</p>\n<p>One is a mistake made in a technical lemma in the field of motivic cohomology, a field involving top mathematicians at top universities, Voevodsky himself being a top expert getting later the Fields medal for his work -- everything top. This is the case mentioned where people held seminars all over the world, but did not detect the mistake, accepting the technical result without checking the proof, trusting Voevodsky's authority, and using it in subsequent work. Voevodsky himself found the gap and provided a correct proof. In the end it was just a technical mistake, but potentially affecting many people's work.</p>\n<p>The other mistake is his result with Kapranov about strict \\infty-groupoids realising all homotopy types. That's a very different context: it was around 1990, years before people like Baez-Dolan, Street, Batanin, Tamsamani and Simpson really got higher category theory started. It seems that not so many people took notice at the time, and it was published in <em>Cahiers</em>, a very good journal, but probably considered 'obscure' by most people outside category theory. Those who did take notice did maybe not fully believe the result: it was already known that the result could not be true with standard geometric realisation. The subtle point was that the KV argument used a non-standard geometric realisation. I suppose the reaction at the time was: 'maybe it is true, maybe not, but it is not about the standard geometric realisation we care about'.</p>\n<p>Simpson's preprint contradicting Kapranov-Voevodsky came in 1998. He was not able to debug the KV proof and pinpoint a faulty deduction, which is difficult because the paper is very sketchy. But what he did was much better (unfortunately not mentioned in the various Voevodsky interviews): he found the <em>reason</em> it could not work, namely a problem with strict units, hence showing that the mistake is a conceptual one, not just a technical one. Simpson also conjectured that the mistake could be fixed if working with weak units instead of strict units.</p>\n<p>Voevodsky said he was not convinced about the mistake until 15 years after Simpson's paper. One reason is of course: could Simpson's paper be trusted? In fact Simpson at that time was already experiencing all the trouble Voevodsky describes: that his papers were too difficult to check fully. (In fact, one of Simpson's main papers on higher categories [A closed model structure for n-categories, internal Hom n-stacks and generalized Seifert-Van Kampen (1997)] had a gap, that it took a 300-page PhD thesis to fill [Péllissier, 2002].) Simpson worked ten years on formalising proofs in Coq (long before Voevodsky), hoping that he would one day be able to certify his own papers. (He came as far as giving a fully certified proof of the Gabriel-Zisman localisation theorem in simplicial homotopy theory, and suggested that this was probably the first proof ever! -- Gabriel and Zisman themselves admit that the details are too unwieldy to write down.)</p>\n<p>Coming back to the KV paper: I worked several years on Simpson's conjecture, and tried hard to understand the KV ideas, but ended up approaching the conjecture with other methods, and eventually drifted to other problems. I did not get deep enough into their proof to understand what went wrong. But now, over the past few years, Simon Henry has made important inroads to the theory, and proved a version of the conjecture. His approach follows the KV idea, but uses a lot of modern machinery. I don't know if he can pinpoint the precise mistake in KV, but in any case Henry's actual results are of course more important than the historical curiosity of what went wrong in the KV proof.</p>\n<p>Oops, that's probably over the page limit :-( And sorry for the full stops. I hope it does not sound too much like a lecture.</p>",

So I agree with John that it would have been much to ask mathematicians who were already doubtful of the result to first reconstruct the supposed proof, and <em>then</em> find a mistake. :)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yeah.  And again, Carlos Simpson <em>did</em> write <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9810059\" title=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9810059\">a paper</a> in 1998 showing what everyone believed, namely that the result of the <a href=\"https://eudml.org/doc/91469\" title=\"https://eudml.org/doc/91469\">1991 paper</a> was false.  </p>\n<p>So,  I think math was working just fine in this episode, albeit a bit slowly: if someone writes a sketchy paper with a wrong-looking result in a fairly esoteric area, other people aren't going to drop what they're doing and try to make the arguments precise in order to locate a flaw: most of them will just ignore this paper.  </p>\n<p>It's a bit like if a programmer released some hard-to-read code that claims to do something that's pretty obviously impossible: will other programmers spend time looking for a bug?</p>\n<p>But okay, enough about that.  What was the 1993 paper that Voevodsky was talking about, in which he himself found a mistake?  Oh, I see <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"276625\">@Joachim Kock</span> explained it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One is a mistake made in a technical lemma in the field of motivic cohomology, a field involving top mathematicians at top universities, Voevodsky himself being a top expert getting later the Fields medal for his work -- everything top. This is the case mentioned where people held seminars all over the world, but did not detect the mistake, accepting the technical result without checking the proof, trusting Voevodsky's authority, and using it in subsequent work. Voevodsky himself found the gap and provided a correct proof. In the end it was just a technical mistake, but potentially affecting many people's work.</p>\n</blockquote>",

The long-running saga that started around the same time as the HoTT special year may have done lasting damage to pure mathematics, precisely because \"eventually\" took too long. I think there's been damage done because the most recent instalment of that saga led to people talking about \"socially constructed mathematics\" again. It's not the first time someone has brought up that argument, and it probably won't be the last. That IS damage.</p>",

There are lots of reasons why people publish open source software on Github, and one of them is to invite feedback <em>because</em> the code isn't ready to be used in the real world.
