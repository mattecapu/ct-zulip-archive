Since the new TD will have more than 2x the budget of the current NSF, what you may see in the new NSTF is a dominant TD faction over the other non-TDs for the 5 years the $100b is being disbursed. The interim politics over the 5 years may see the non-TD part of NSTF cut down to size.</p>\n<p>Once the five years is up or the $100b gets whittled down in the future, what will the situation be then? Going by historical trends, fiscally conservative voices may rise up and demand a budget cut. If they succeed, you may get something like the ARC in Australia, which has a \"National Research Priorities\" mission similar to the TD's \"focus areas\", and funds very little curiosity-driven research that doesn't align itself with those priorities (or doesn't already have backing from people who have a good track record of getting funds from the ARC).</p>",
