I Interviewed for a job there ~5 years ago, but ended up staying where I was at at the time (<a href=\"https://auxon.io\">auxon.io</a> (where I was last involved in the FM space)). As I think about returning because I miss the intellectual itch it scratches, I find myself interested in not just the theory, but the exposition it takes to turn the theory into a product.</p>",
