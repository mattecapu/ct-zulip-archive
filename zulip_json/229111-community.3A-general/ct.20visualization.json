(The support team is terrific.) To be clear: Protege beautifully supports the creation of sophisticated ontologies that are then accessed logically.</p>",

Just the usual big table in alphabetical order if you are looking for someone</li>\n<li>Map view. Having everyone's name as a pin on a map, together with their research topic. Useful if you want to find someone nearby doing research in some field</li>\n<li>Graph view. Here nodes are research topics, edges denote some sort of relatedness/dependnecy. E.g. You may have edges from/to \"algebraic geometry\" and \"higher category theory\". On each vertex, you have a set of people working in that topic. BTW, I don't think this will end up being a (pre)sheaf, but if would be very cool if it did!</li>\n</ol>",

Protege! <br>\nJust to start a (quick) response: The philosophy is to begin with the kinds of questions you would like to ask — starting with basic ones, and then getting as deep as you want. Then you look at the terms/ notions and the relationships that would underlie the (construction/ inference of) a response/ answer￼￼. You do not need to figure out potential reasoning. </p>\n<p>You boil the terms/ relationships down to a labelled network, and Protege helps you construct/ edit it graphically. Searches are done logically, as in a conventional database — but the Protege system does a really deep inferential search. The responses come out, along with the underlying reasoning ( which can be metaphorically based). </p>\n<p>Hope this helps.</p>",

But this creates a new problem: You'd need to categorize all the papers using keywords and such. This is doable, but it has to be obviously automated, and when you do so data will be dirty (mismatches, etc) and in need to be cleaned. I'd forget about the paper stuff altogether for now, because this is the kind of task that could assume monumental dimensions very quickly xD</p>",
