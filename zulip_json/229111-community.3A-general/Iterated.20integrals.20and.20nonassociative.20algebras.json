        "content": "<p>Hi <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"275920\">@John Baez</span> , thanks for the interest! Currently, one object of interest to me is the half-shuffle, also known as commutative dendriform algebra, or Zinbiel algebra ('Zinbiel' b/c of Koszul duality to Leibniz algebras). You might know this product from \"Eilenberg S, MacLane S. 1953 On the groups H(π, n).\"</p>\n<p>Denote this product by a &gt; b, then: a &gt; (b &gt;c) = (a&gt;b + b&gt;a) &gt; c. I am interested in its antisymmetrization 'area(a,b) := a&gt;b - b&gt;a' (the half-shuffle corresponds to integration of smooth functions against each other, 'area' corresponds to calculating the area between them). It is a non-associative product; apart from anti-symmetry there is no other relation with two inputs; there is no new relation with three inputs; there is exactly one new relation with four inputs, sometimes called 'tortkara', which is believed to be the only additional relation.<br>\nThe symmetrization of the half-shuffle, a&gt;b+b&gt;a, is the (associative and commutative !) shuffle product. Being allowed to apply the shuffle and 'area' product indiscriminately (think: binary rooted trees with 'shuffle' or 'area' decorating the inner nodes) one 'gets everything' (i.e. starting with generators of the half-shuffle algebra, which are letters of some finite alphabet, one generates the entire half-shuffle algebra).<br>\nFor several reasons, we are interested in reducing this to (sums of) trees, where shuffles are only allowed to appear as a subtree connected to the root. In words: \"One can apply 'area' to the generators as often as one desires, and with the results, one is only allowed to shuffle (but never to take areas again).\"</p>\n<p>We have an indirect proof that this works, but we don't really understand 'area' well enough yet, to have a direct proof.</p>",

I was a bit sloppy with language here. The book-keeping devices are the algebras. Concretely, for iterated-integrals of a stochastic process (which are important for several reasons: numerics, asymptotics, statistics, control theory, rough path analysis, ...) one usually stores them as a multiplicative character on the \"shuffle Hopf algebra\". The product in this Hopf algebra is the (commutative, associative) shuffle product. This is nicely compatible with taking real-valued products of real-valued iterated-integrals. The coproduct is the (noncommutative, coassociative) deconcatenation coproduct, which is nicely compatible with the concatenation (as paths) of stochastic processes.</p>",
