        "content": "<p>During the winter vacations I wanted to code something for fun with Svelte 5, and I also reminded myself that I always wanted to have a basic visual diagram editor that generates tikzcd code and which is intuitive and easy to use*. So I made the <a href=\"https://tikzcd-creator.netlify.app/\">tikzcd creator</a>. Please check it out and let me know what you think! The idea of the user interface is to make it <em>dead simple</em> and also enjoyable to use. Even on mobile. The diagram is generated <em>step by step</em>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/VMB_CrJ7XjgAvoGSRoRjep8b/Bildschirmfoto-2025-02-18-um-23.41.26.png\">Screenshot</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/VMB_CrJ7XjgAvoGSRoRjep8b/Bildschirmfoto-2025-02-18-um-23.41.26.png\" title=\"Screenshot\"><img data-original-content-type=\"image/png\" data-original-dimensions=\"1012x648\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/21317/VMB_CrJ7XjgAvoGSRoRjep8b/Bildschirmfoto-2025-02-18-um-23.41.26.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div><p>The code is on <a href=\"https://github.com/ScriptRaccoon/tikzcd-creator\">GitHub</a>, where you also find some demos. <span aria-label=\"technologist\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f9d1-200d-1f4bb\" role=\"img\" title=\"technologist\">:technologist:</span> </p>\n<p>*Nothing against <a href=\"https://q.uiver.app/\">quiver</a>, but for me it's a bit too complex <span aria-label=\"face in clouds\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f636-200d-1f32b\" role=\"img\" title=\"face in clouds\">:face_in_clouds:</span> .

I saw the clowder project has been announced here. But there is also \"community: our work\" and \"practice: software\". Please let me know if it is more appropriate there. Then my next big announcement ( <span aria-label=\"shushing face\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f92b\" role=\"img\" title=\"shushing face\">:shushing_face:</span>) will be there. ;)</p>",

The reason is that personally (!) I am overwhelmed with a menu where I can do everything at a time (that would be kind of the alternative I guess), and I wouldn't know immediately what to use which for. So my idea was to focus just on one task. And let the UI guide you.<br>\nMaybe it isn't working for everyone, though.<br>\nI also noticed that this approach works best if I already have a diagram on paper and would like to TeX it.<br>\nDeveloping a new diagram with my editor is unfortunately a mess because for these diagrams you will most certainly not do all the nodes, all the arrows, etc. but rather jump between the steps.<br>\nMaybe I should add breadcrumbs or something like that so that jumping is easier.<br>\nOr just ditch the whole step by step approach <span aria-label=\"laughing\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f606\" role=\"img\" title=\"laughing\">:laughing:</span></p>",

I think I will choose the existing quiver conversation for that. But as mentioned, these might be things that aren't necessarily relevant for all users.</p>",
