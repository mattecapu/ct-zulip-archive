P=NP then means that there are no hard problems: you give me a source, say a ciphertext, and i can compute any information that it contains. (such was shannon's world: if there is a statistical correlation, the cryptanalyst will find a lever to move the information.)</p>\n<p>however, it may happen that P=/=NP but AP=ANP. that means that some problems have hard instances, but they are easy on average. hard instances infeasible to find. (this is what worried leonid levin, when he proceeded,  after his very elegant \"cook-levin thesis\", to develop the very messy average-case complexity theory.)</p>\n<p>and then there is impagliazzo's thesis. suppose that we have a problem that is hard on the average, and thus ANP=/=AP. the chance that we can guess hard instances of a problem is not always correlated with the chance that we can guess <em>solved instances</em>. so it may happen that there are plenty of hard problems, but that it is unfeasible to construct one-way functions. (levin constructed his universal one-way function trying to derive it from a vanilla ANP problem, but failed.)</p>\n<p>and to split the last hair, suppose there are plenty of hard problems with solutions, which allows you to construct one-way functions. to make it into a trapdoor function, you need to provide a succinct encoding of the solution. aka the KEY of the cipher. is it not possible that we can construct lots of one-way functions, but the size of their solutions for the hard direction grows intractably, and we still cannot build crypto systems with short keys? </p>\n<p>well yes, we know at least one line of constructions that would make this possible. which brings us to (2).</p>\n<p>but i don't want to bore you. this is already too long, and prolly too heavy. if anyone is interested, i can tell more l8r.</p>",

I have a concrete technical answer. I hope i'll upload it to arxiv within a month or so. It's a whole textbook. I have had the \"good fortune\" to be tasked with teaching computability and complexity every once in a while since 1995. Since roughly 2008, the course was mostly in string diagrams. Since 2016, it's been an undergraduate course. You never say the word \"category\", but draw pictures. Acceptable systems of indices are a simple monoidal structure. Then complexity measures are projections of Kleene's normal form. That is the idea. But making it useful takes a while. The early versions were pretty silly, and maybe the current one still is. I am rewriting the final chapter 4th time. That's not a good sign. But that can only be my own personal silliness. There must be a way to do complexity theory categorically, just like there must be a way for objects heavier than air, and different from birds, to fly in the air. It just takes time.</p>",

Indeed, the summary there reads just like your interpretation, but to me it seems like exactly the opposite: the massive strength of relativisation is that, when done carefully, it precisely controlled the parametricity of proofs. For example, in topos theory, we have (informally speaking) that everything than can be proven constructively applies over every topos, but anything requiring excluded middle applies only over Boolean toposes, anything relying on de Morgan's law applies only over de Morgan toposes etc. If one defines oracles as \"base objects\" with enough structure that cases can similarly be distinguished (I'm not going to push toposes, but... they are <em>right there</em>...), it seems like a great approach to take, especially given that complexity really <em>should</em> be a relative concept, even in applications: if we find a black box that makes some algorithm really cheap to run, that necessarily changes the complexity theory landscape.</p>",

There are many ways to relativize complexity besides  oracles and Turing degrees. In fact, there is a complexity research community that thinks that the whole reason why it got stuck was that it has been worked out without the relativizations needed to express that a problem is hard in one parameter but easy in another. Check <em>parametrized complexity</em>. There are textbooks by Martin Grohe, Downey, Fellows and Downey.</p>",

There are many ways to relativize complexity besides  oracles and Turing degrees. In fact, there is a complexity research community that thinks that the whole reason why it got stuck was that it has been worked out without the relativizations needed to express that a problem is hard in one parameter but easy in another. Check <em>parametrized complexity</em>. There are textbooks by Martin Grohe, Downey, Fellows and Downey.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Parametrized complexity is very useful for connecting back to the practical success or failure of algorithms (eg why is it that many instances of SAT can be solved in practice, even though SAT is NP-hard?). But it does not \"explain away\" the difficulty of P vs NP. Indeed, many of the standard conjectures in parametrized complexity imply P vs NP, so the parametrized conjectures, while perhaps more relevant to practice, are in fact <em>even harder</em> than separating P from NP.</p>",

Descriptive  complexity  [Imm99],  based  on  finite  model  theory,  has  been  quite successful at characterizing nearly every well-known complexity class.  However,  it  has  provided  no  workable  ideas  concerning  lower  bounds.   Implicit computational  complexity,  which  is  one  of  the  topics  we  touched  upon  in this  thesis,  is  situated  at  the  other  end  of  the  logical  spectrum,  at  the  interface  between  recursion  theory,  type  theory  and  the  theory  of  programming languages.  This approach too seems to be worthless when it comes to lower bound techniques.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think that's one of his motivations for turning to other topics at the interface of categories and complexity theory, such as the topos-theoretic viewpoint on CSPs which I mentioned earlier in this thread.</p>",
