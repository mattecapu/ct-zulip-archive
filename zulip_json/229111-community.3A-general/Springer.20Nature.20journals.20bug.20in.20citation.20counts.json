The contract they force you to sign now seems to forbid putting your paper on the arXiv unless you state that the copyright belongs to Springer.  You have to stick lots of crud on the end of your paper saying which author did which percent of the work.  Springer charges <strong>huge amounts of money for its journals</strong> and university libraries are starting to rebel.  Etc.</p>\n<p>When <em>Theory and Applications of Categories</em> was founded, a lot of famous category theorists quit being editors at <em>Applied Categorical Structures</em> and became editors at <em>Theory and Applications of Categories</em>.    I support <em>TAC</em> and avoid <em>ACS</em> like the plague.</p>",
