When it was introduced in 2013 by Arkani-Hamed and Trnka, <em>Quanta Magazine</em> reported that “Physicists have discovered a jewel-like geometric object that dramatically simplifies calculations of particle interactions and challenges the notion that space and time are fundamental components of reality…”  Scattering amplitudes are the bread and butter of quantum field theory. In this short article, we will not get as far as challenging the notions of space and time, but we will give some explanation as to the nature and significance of the amplituhedron both in physics and mathematics—where it arises as a natural generalization of the subject of total positivity for Grassmannians.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The stuff about \"challenging the notions of space and time\" is basically hype, but you can read this summary article <a href=\"https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201802/rnoti-p167.pdf\">here</a>.</p>",
