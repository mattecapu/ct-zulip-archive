It is an honor for the entire Brazilian category theory community. </p>\n<p>On behalf of my doctoral advisor Hugo Luiz Mariano, professor and researcher in Category Theory at the institute, we thank everyone involved. In particular, we would like to thank <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"276656\">@Valeria de Paiva</span> for recommending USP. I believe this will greatly contribute to the training of more researchers in CT in Brazil and South America.</p>",
