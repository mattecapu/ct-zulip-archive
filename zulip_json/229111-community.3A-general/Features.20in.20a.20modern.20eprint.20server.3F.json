Regarding: <a class=\"stream-topic\" data-stream-id=\"229111\" href=\"/#narrow/channel/229111-community.3A-general/topic/AI-generated.20papers/with/547042620\">#community: general &gt; AI-generated papers</a></p>\n<p>I know right now there is some worry about preprints/etc. I've actually been working coding up a new eprint server as part of a startup project. After speaking with several people in the research community it seems there is increasing demand for alternatives with better features. I already have a pretty good working prototype (React/Django/Postgres/S3 modern stack) that has some pretty nice goodies (AI-assisted [not solely!] screening to catch 99% of BS papers, richer diffs, native github/code data integration, native API that directly supports overlay journals with GraphQL).</p>\n<p>While I don't have a private demo to showcase just yet, I'm wondering what people would want in a modern preprint server? What features do people consider most important? Please fire away.</p>",

ArXiv effectively bans the use of these things, since it will detect that the pdf is produced by LaTeX and demand you upload the source, but it can't compile the source, so there's effectively no way to upload it at all. I think this is actually quite damaging to the open source ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Really though, the most important feature in a preprint server is a plausible guarantee that the papers will continue to be accessible in the long term. Anything else is extra.</p>",
