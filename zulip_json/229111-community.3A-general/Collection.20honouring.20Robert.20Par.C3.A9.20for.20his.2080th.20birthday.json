This collection will bring together contributions which honour the lasting impact Bob has made, and is making, in the category theory community.</p>\n<p>Submissions will be open from 1 October 2024 until 30 June 2025 at this link: <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/collections/dijeibfdbh\">https://link.springer.com/collections/dijeibfdbh</a></p>\n<p>All submissions on topics which celebrate Bob's work are welcome, including double categories, higher categories, indexed categories, toposes and accessible categories. </p>\n<p>The collection will be edited by four guest editors:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bryce Clarke (Tallinn University of Technology) </li>\n<li>Marco Grandis (University of Genoa) </li>\n<li>Dorette Pronk (Dalhousie University)</li>\n<li>Christina Vasilakopoulou (National Technical University of Athens) </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The publication process for this collection in Applied Categorical Structures differs from the traditional model for a special volume. Articles are published within whichever issue is open at the time, and concurrently published in the collection available at the above link. This helps papers to be published quickly, without having to wait for a whole issue to be ready, while still allowing all papers in the collection to be available in a single place.</p>\n<p>The editors are happy to answer any questions, and we look forward to receiving your submissions. </p>\n<p>Best wishes, </p>\n<p>Bryce, Marco, Dorette, and Christina.</p>",
