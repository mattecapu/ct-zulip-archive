I was curious if I could get more insight about what would be a good rule of thumb for writing such a paper to the ACT venue given that it is both a mathematics venue and applications venue. The core question I have in paper writing is, if the paper is more of an application, how much theory I should include and, similarly, if a paper is more theoretical, how much of an application should I make mention to? Could someone help me give a sense of this either via an example or general sort of outline you might suggest?</p>\n<p>The reason for this question is that the CfP itself is quite expansive to my reading. Hence, the desire for some suggestions around how to approach the CfP:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Applied category theory (ACT) is a field of growing importance to communities of researchers in computer science, logic, engineering, physics, biology, chemistry, social science, systems, linguistics and other subjects. The background and experience of the ACT community is as varied as the systems being studied. The goal of the Applied Category Theory conference series is to bring researchers together, strengthen the applied category theory community, disseminate the latest results, and facilitate further development of the field.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Someone actually involved in this conference might answer your question better, but personally I'd say the ideal paper shows mastery of category theory and shows how to apply it in a really useful way - not merely translating some problem into the language of category theory, but using that to help <em>solve</em> the problem.</p>",

It’s inevitably a bit biased, but it probably tells you more than the blurb. (I’m not saying it ought to be this way, nor encouraging game-playing!)</p>",
