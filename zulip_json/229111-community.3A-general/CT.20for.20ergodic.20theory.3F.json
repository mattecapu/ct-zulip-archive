Many “irrational” behaviors or “cognitive biases” are actually individuals realizing that a system is non-ergodic and not optimizing for expected value.</p>\n</blockquote>",

But a safety track record is an expectation value (or an <em>ensemble average</em>), whereas people who do think about the safety of air travel quickly realise that the conditional probability of death, given that you're on a crashing plane, is pretty high, when compared to other modes of transport. </p>\n<p>One major factor is the lack of evasive actions you can take to mitigate the situation. There's not much you can do when a plane is about to crash to mitigate your risk of death, but there's quite a bit you can do if you're in a car, bus or boat, mostly because the presence of mitigation measures available to the passengers is <em>mandated by legislation</em>.</p>",
