        "content": "<p>Hey folks, one often talks about applications of math to real life problems, but I've never heard about applications of 'mathematical thinking' in real life, or, dually, principles from real life giving insight in math.<br>\nI'll start with the example that kicked it for me. Sometimes in math it's just too hard to attack a problem directly, you need instead to make a long detour, building a theory around it, and eventually its solution will unfold effortlessly before your eyes. This latter 'problem solving' strategy is famously due to Grothendieck, he called it 'the rising sea' (even though, tbh, I always found his metaphor quite odd).<br>\nSo it came to my mind that this way of tackling a big problem might also be effective in real life. Some social issues, e.g. patriarchalism, are so big that any attempt to tackle them directly is pointless, or even worse, they might backfire. People tend to react harshly if you tell them they are doing something wrong, especially if they didn't think about it before, and they have no real good reason to continue doing it. They feel ashamed, and they get angry at you. Silly, but humane. <br>\nTherefore, instead of going around yelling at people, sometimes it might be better to 'be patient', and try to develop a good context in which to frame the critique, and let the rising sea do its thing<br>\nIdk if it makes sense to you people. I'm also curious about examples going the other way around, i.e. real life episodes/mindsets that inspired some good insight in math</p>",
