        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"419987\">@Josh Lalonde</span> <br>\nSo, I decided I needed a break and found the source I was thinking of. Let me start by saying I had my dates a little mixed up in my head. This was after Lawvere's time at Dalhousie. Also, I for some reason thought his Functorial Semantics was later work, when it was actually part of his dissertation. I think it was published later. In any case, this account is immaterial to that work, though both people were alike in spirit with respect to work on categories and syntax/semantics. </p>\n<p>The other person was a biologist I know some here are familiar with given the relationship he had with category theory: Robert Rosen. If you haven't heard of him, I recommend at least doing a quick search.  As far as I am able to discern from literature, he was the first to publish works on applications of category theory outside of mathematics itself. His first such seems to have been in 1958, so pretty early. He also studied the topic under both MacLane and Eilenberg, though transferred out of math to earn his doctorate in biology instead. </p>\n<p>Ultimately, he would develop a model of life (to be distinguished in kind from non-life) using some basic category theory, in addition to lots of writing on abstract \"modeling relations\" (formal syntax-semantics maps), measurement, and feedforward systems which he called \"anticipatory\". There have been mixed reviews on his use of math, since he did not always write it in a rigorous manner, especially when using it to develop his more philosophical ideas. The really interesting part to me IS the philosophy of science work he did, though. In many ways, he (in spirit) anticipated some of the work I see happening recently in this community, especially as relates to questions of compositionality and emergent/generative features, though he used different terms. It's exciting to see math really making formal headway into some of these old questions.</p>\n<p>Anyway, this does relate back to Lawvere! It is possible they knew of each other due to both having been at Columbia with Eilenberg (at different times, though. Rosen left in 1957 and Lawvere arrived in 1960). Rosen would start at SUNY-Buffalo and move to Dalhousie in 1975. Lawvere, of course, was at Dalhousie first and in 1974 moved to SUNY-Buffalo.  But they did in fact know each other when Rosen by his account went to bat for the \"eminent category theorist\" whom he helped get hired at SUNY, just before he left. He doesn't name Lawvere, but I can't imagine any other conclusion.</p>\n<p>So, I don't know if that is helpful to you. I just happen to have been interested in Rosen's work, and recalled that passage. I guess I recalled it being more relevant than it turned out to be once I found the source again. The source, by the way, is \"Old Trends and New Trends in General System Research,\" a memorial lecture he gave for von Bertalanffy. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/03081077908960904\">https://doi.org/10.1080/03081077908960904</a></p>\n<p>Here is the excerpt, which follows a brief historical account of the development of category theory. One of his points in the talk was that category theory is a natural language for formally describing Bertalanffy's general system theory (for instance like Mesarovic has tried to do): </p>\n<p>\"It is interesting to note that Category Theory has elicited exactly the same reaction within the community of pure mathematicians that system-theoretic approaches have generated in the community of experimental or empirical scientists. Initially, category theory was dismissed out of hand by many mathematicians as at best a cumbersome language for stating well-known facts about algebraic topology. Later, when it became clear that category theory could answer important open questions in a variety of areas, it was conceded to be of some limited usefulness for specific applications, but still of no significance as an independent branch of mathematics. This attitude is still prevalent; indeed, just a few years ago, I served on the Executive Committee of the Department of Mathematics at SUNY Buffalo, when that department was in the process of hiring an eminent category theorist. A substantial group of senior faculty tried to block this appointment on the grounds that category theory was not real mathematics; they were dissuaded only with difficulty from writing to other departments to collect opinions on whether category theory was mathematics or not.\"</p>\n<p>At the very least, it is interesting to piece together these random connections from the past! Also, there is much to be gleaned by digging through the old texts, finding forgotten threads of research.</p>",

Bill gives explain more of the story on p.5-7 that sounds like part of a movie plot, and indicates that he was a also avery early pioneer of ACT, in a way that is reminiscent of how certain political actors in the US have been involved with ACT funding over the past ~10 years. Let me quote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My acceptance of the job offered by the “Think Tank” in Southern California depended on an agreement that the main topic treated would be Kennedy’s Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. The preliminary interview in the Pentagon was requested by that Agency. Somewhat more precisely, the aim of the study would be: planning for the technical support of an Arms Control Treaty between the Superpowers, for example, of a reliable verification protocol to be agreed upon.</p>\n<p>It was envisaged that a protocol would involve three tiers of verification: Space, Stratosphere, and On-site. The passage from one tier to the next would follow probabilistically from continuing observations. What would be the mathematical framework under which this whole fantasy would function? Someone described it as a “network of probabilistic mappings”. “What would that mean?” I asked myself: “It must involve diagrams in a category extending the monoid of Markov processes”, and then I produced the present document, which served as an Appendix to an Appendix of a large SECRET document.</p>\n<p>The proposal was to study a projected system of verification and inspection for a possible Arms Control Agreement between the Superpowers. The system would be organized into the three levels: satellite surveillance, which could trigger the request for over-flight inspection, that in turn could trigger an on-site inspection. Of course, the trigger thresholds would be a matter of diplomacy, but the system as a whole would involve an elaborate network of “probabilistic mappings”.</p>\n<p>The whole thing had to be scrutinized by the Pentagon before the Arms Control Agency could do anything. Probably, passing through so many hands increased its exposure to espionage. The leader of the group within the Think Tank stated that an important calculation to be done by the study would be the determination of the probability of the discovery of missiles concealed on the ocean floor as part of a planned circumvention of any treaty. That was also the year of the Cuban missile crisis</p>\n<p>A few years later I came across a Russian document containing several of the results of my unpublished thesis, including the mistakes, (as well as the missing two lines that we later discovered had been missed by the typist). But there was no attribution. And in Moscow the lectures were beginning on a very similar category, called the Markov category (not without justification, of course, although I don’t believe Markov himself used categories).</p>\n<p>I was surprised a couple of years later by being offered a job with French military intelligence. The one who transmitted that offer was a collaborator of M. Giry, which may explain why she knew about the “secret” developments in the US.</p>\n<p>Apparently regarding the contact with the Arms Control Agency as dormant, the leaders of the Think Tank had a further proposal, disregarding their initial agreement with me: First, I should study books by Mao Tsetung and Che Guevara as a preparation for evaluating a large system designed to eliminate the guerilla threat in Vietnam. My last paychecks were for studying that proposal. Of course, I advised against it, after having verified mathematically that the proposed system was unfeasible. The last time I saw the director of the “Vietnam Proposal” was at the old Waltham Watch Factory, which had been taken over as a subsidiary of the California Think Tank. Naturally, my report met with utter disapproval. I took a bus from Waltham to NYC in order to defend my thesis at Hamilton Hall, in front of Eilenberg, Kadison, and Morgenbesser. Now I could complete my application for a teaching job at Reed College.</p>\n<p>A few years later the New York Times reported on the failure of a large system that differed only in detail from the one I had analyzed. The supporters of the proposal had taken the plan and defected to another Think Tank.</p>\n</blockquote>",

We know the classification results for the sample, i.e., we have the map <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>X</mi><mo>→</mo><mi>D</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">X \\to D</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.07847em;\">X</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">→</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.02778em;\">D</span></span></span></span>.

However, I point out that sometimes we achieve this extension by constructing a retraction <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>E</mi><mo>→</mo><mi>X</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">E \\to X</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.05764em;\">E</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">→</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.07847em;\">X</span></span></span></span> from the population back to the sample. This is the case with the nearest neighbor algorithm. We know how a certain number of points are classified, so to decide how to classify a fresh point, look to see the result on the nearest member of the sample. Then things look closer to what Lawvere is describing. We want to know how to classify points in <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>X</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">X</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.07847em;\">X</span></span></span></span>.
