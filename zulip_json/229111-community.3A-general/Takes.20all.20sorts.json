There is a traditional bias toward one-sorted theories.

This immediately roots us firmly in the land of 1-categories—all the other relational structure that actually provides the important part of category theory may as well be of a different sort.</p>\n<p>This is something I feel is true in general about category theory right now: its constructions are “allowed” to be built out of non-categorical parts, sort of, and then only identified retrospectively as part of the categorical story. Consider the explicit construction of comma categories, or the way natural transformations are suddenly allowed to map objects to arrows. We later find that comma categories are a certain kind of 2-limit, and natural transformations are 2-arrows. But once we’ve moved to this view, we’ve lost the “bones” of these constructions—or at least, I have! Afaik, there’s no sort of unified, systematic way of corresponding “nuts and bolts” definitions, like that of the comma category, with its categorical (often universal property) realization, without proving things out in individual cases. (This might just be my lack of experience talking, but...)</p>\n<p>Contrast this situation to an extent with type theory, where things at least appear to be more foundational: all of our notation “knows what it is”, and isn’t an opaque object potentially shielding details below it. On one hand, that’s one of the great capabilities of category theory: to abstract away the details and  let us work in a more relational way. On the other hand, it would be nice to have a more systematic dictionary between the two perspectives, somehow!</p>",

This is why having a geometric logic formulation for local rings is so handy, for example: it means that the inverse image functors of geometric morphisms send local rings to local rings.<br>\nMore generally, you don't express a theory as first-order or single-sorted it in order to restrict how you concretely reason about their models, you do it so it falls into a class that you can analyse simultaneously at a greater level of generality. I don't suddenly ignore the unique maximal ideal of a local ring just because I can remove it from my axioms!</p>",
