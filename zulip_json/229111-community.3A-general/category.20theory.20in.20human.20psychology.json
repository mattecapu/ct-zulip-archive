If I assume that the converse is also true then in some sense studying human emotions will be same as studying different scale patterns in music.

So in that logic a belief is a set of possible worlds. You tend to position yourself as inside the worlds you believe to be true.  But new information can shift your understanding of where you are in the space of possibilities. <br>\nAn example:<br>\n   Jane is walking down a dark street going home after a hard days work. She hears footsteps behind her in the distance getting closer. At this point a number of possibilities could start coming up. Perhaps she is worried and so dangerous ones come to mind. Danger would requiring looking around, but that could reveal fear. So she goes on a bit. Her heart beats  faster, she searches for possible escape routes if the worst were to come true. What door could she ring on? As she gets closer to her friends house she ventures to turn her head: it's her brother. Nothing to worry about.  She smiles.<br>\n   Facts can change emotions, as they change the space of possibilities in which one places oneself.</p>",

In possible worlds logic there is a pointer, the actual world, denoted @, that picks out a world out of the sets of all worlds. (so this works like the counit). That is an indexical, in that for any agent in any world, that world in which that agent is, is the actual one. (It is indexical just like \"now\" is always the time at which that token is spoken, \"I\" refers to the person who utters the word, \"here\" refers to the place of around the person speaking, etc...).

Can the mathematical music theory has the potential to understand/explore/ classify  human emotions?  For example one can argue that the same  music may not induce the  same emotional feeling to each person but I feel there is some universality too ( example  major scales create some joyful feel whereas  minor scales create a little darker feel , Different Raagas in Indian Classical music expresses different moods, same is true when we move from one genre, sub genre of music to another). But let's discuss a hypothetical situation(inspired from <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"319282\">@Chetan Vuppulury</span> ) say a person travels 100 years back and play hard rock then how would a person in 1921 react to it?<br>\n Generally Hard rock expresses  some extreme aggression, rebel,  Boldness....etc(hard to describe in words). But these feelings were still present  in 1921 population but might not have the right music to express them. It's a kind of similar when Einstein found the use of Riemannian geometry(which were developed much before) useful to describe the universe. But there are also other instances like if someone plays smooth Jazz in saxophone(representing a city life) to a rural population of 1500 AD they may not relate to any of their emotions prevalent in their life. But if the same person from 1500 time travels to 2000 and  leads a city life for some years then he/she may relate something to that music.</p>\n<p>Now consider pure Mathematics. It generally explores all the logical structure that can be derived from the fundamental axioms using deductive logic. It generally does not care even if that logical structure fails to prove itself to be  useful to the existing science. But it  may be possible that someone from future can find some usefulness  for that logical structure . </p>\n<p>Keeping the discussion for pure Mathematics in mind , can we say that  one can use music theory  to explore/understand all possible human emotions irrespective of the fact that whether <em>a particular human emotion</em>  can relate to some existing set of emotions in the contemporary population or not?</p>",

This is especially true for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Riemannian_theory\">neo-Riemannian theory</a>, which has been studied using categories.   I pointed you to two papers on that.

So, the mathematical music theory I know doesn't have a lot to say about scales and emotions.  Everyone says \"major is happy, minor is sad\".   That's an oversimplification, but it's not really a good basis for the study of emotions!   It's also not very interesting mathematically.</p>\n<p>There are probably music theorists who study emotions much more deeply.    But anyway, the use of <em>category theory</em> in music seems focused on neo-Riemannian theory, which is a detailed study of chords and voice leadings.</p>",

Till the (late?) 19th century, equal temperament was unusual - the intervals between the semitones were not all equal.  That was a relatively \"modern\" development.   And so the keys did have different flavours till then.  One frequent misunderstanding is what Bach meant by \"Well Tempered Clavier\" - most scholars now agree that he didn't mean \"Equal Tempered Clavier\".  There were several different tunings around then which attempted to allow one to use different keys without sounding \"out of tune\", but were not intended to have the same equal semitones.  But one can dispute that! ;-)   One can actually prove this historical claim pretty convincingly by investigating church organs from before the 19C, and apparently they are differently tuned in different places.  Each town (or whatever) having its own \"preferred tuning\", it seems.</p>\n<p>And whatever this amounts to, certainly ordinary singers were well trained by all accounts - they gave each key its own flavour deliberately, as did (and do) players on instruments without fixed intervals (like the violin family) - I've been told by some violin-playing friends that when playing with other strings (like violas and cellos) that they do _not_ use equal temperament, because they get a better sound with \"natural\" intervals, and they prefer the sound.</p>",

Then a perfect fifth in the key of A will involve a different frequency ratio than a perfect fifth in the key of C.... unless we happen to use equal temperament.</p>\n<p>But I'm suggesting that for a lot of musicians throughout a lot of history, it would be hard to have a setup where individual notes have specific frequencies attached to them!</p>\n<p>Imagine the bare-bones situation: a group of people singing, with no instruments.   If they've got good ears it's easy for them to sing an octave, or a perfect fifth, etc.   So they can easily do something like Pythagorean tuning.   But unless they're really trying to make things complicated, their perfect fifth starting on one note will have the same ratio as their perfect fifth starting at any other note: 3/2.    That's because 3/2 is easy to do and it sounds great.   </p>\n<p>This is not equal temperament, but it <em>also</em> means that different keys won't have different flavors, unless they work to achieve that.   </p>\n<p>If they're singing in a church with an organ, then it's different: the organ will probably dictate the tuning system they use, as you suggest, and a song in the key of A will sound different than a song in the key of C.  But this is different from the highly mathematical approaches beloved by tuning freaks - you know, the kind who say \"Kirnberger III is better than meantone temperament\".  This is just people working with the instruments they have.    </p>\n<p>I've been to a village in Bali that had a gamelan with an unusual tuning system:  that is part of the charm of that village.   I think there's no real way to tune most of the instruments in a gamelan after they're built.   To what extent can you tune a pipe organ?</p>",

I'm trying to learn more about early music and baroque music.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So this is where we disagree - I'll let you look up some authorities on tuning before the 19th century.  But here is my understanding.  This is not a question of having tuning forks, or other tuners, since it wasn't the exact frequencies that were important (it's a fact that something like \"middle C\" was interpreted as a different frequency in different locales - even within the same country or society - this has been verified by checking the tuning of organ pipes, which once in place are rather difficult to retune!)  The question was of relative intervals - what a mathematician would regard as ratios of frequencies (so e.g. an octave is 2:1, etc).  And there were several tuning systems in place during the period before the 19th C - And still today there are are different tuning systems (e.g. as I said before with string quartets, etc).  So the different keys actually had different intervals between the notes of an octave - and hence different \"qualities\" - some thing that was lost with equal temperament.  </p>\n<p>So, in short: we have nothing to teach musicians (say) before the 18th C - they knew how to tune their instruments \"perfectly\", and no electronic tuners were necessary - indeed, ask any solo guitarist today if they need such tuners!!  Certainly I never did - if the intervals between the strings were right (that can be done by ear), you're ready to go.  If you're playing with other guitarists, you all agree on (say) A, and go from there.  It gets more complicated the more instruments you're playing with, of course, and that's where a tuning fork or whatever is useful.  Or else just agree to agree with the violas!</p>",

Either that or I'm misunderstanding what one or both of you are saying.  The tuning forks etc. nail down a base frequency to a particular note, and that nailing down, specifically, seems to be what John is avoiding.  If indeed \"middle C\" was interpreted as a different frequency in different locales, that would support not nailing down a base frequency to a particular note.  And I know enough European music history to know that you are absolutely correct that \"middle C\" was interpreted as a different frequency in different locales.</p>",

As long as the relative frequencies are identical between performances, I don't think most people would notice a difference (especially if the piece features a positive number of changes in key).

But I would still beg to differ - I wasn't talking about keyboards (hence the explicit reference to guitars etc), but rather the intervals between tones.  And that remains the issue I think.  Singers, string players, and especially wind instruments (before keys!) all are very aware of the \"natural\" intervals between notes, and in the era of \"natural temperaments\", it really does make a difference where you put the various \"big\" and \"small\" semitones.  So: it really doesn't matter what your A is (as a frequency), but it does matter where the large and small semitone intervals occur.

They might not say they are singing in A or C or whatever, but different \"scales\" would still be something to be aware of.  </p>\n<p>But at this point I suspect we've drifted from the topics at hand .... ;-)   On this we'll agree, probably: different keys became a bigger deal with the advent of popular keyboard instruments.

Though the converse may not be true that is whether every emotion can be expressed through some sequence of musical notes or not. If I assume that the converse is also true then in some sense studying human emotions will be same as studying different scale patterns in music. But I guess that  there are some good work on axiomatising music theory through category theory (for example <em>The Topos of Music</em> <a href=\"https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783764357313\">https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783764357313</a>). So in that case can the study of music theory will be considered as a study of human emotions(which is a part of human psychology)?</p>\n<p>I apologise priorly if I sound very naive. I am a music enthusiast and play some musical instruments. I always felt the connection of emotion and music. So I am just curious.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We are currently using our quantum natural language framework, which is categorical, to generate music on quantum computers in collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/staff/eduardo-miranda\">https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/staff/eduardo-miranda</a>  This must be the wildest thing I have ever done.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I guess it would be interesting to have a music and mathematics thread. I'd be interested to know if there anyone has used the work from \"The Topos of Music\" to create new music that could not have been thought of before, or indeed if any music had come out of it. </p>\n<p>Not sure if the quantum computer work is related, but can one listen to anything? <br>\n(I know nothing about music theory so perhaps it is just that learning of it from the CT Side would be a good way to learn a new way to think of category theory)</p>",

The author of the book <a href=\"https://paradigmexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Network-Review-2009-101-final.pdf#page=5\">according to medical journal article</a>, was 2009 Fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists and fellow of All Souls College, Oxford. </p>\n<p>Let me assume that what he has written is generally correct - and I am sure there are people here who will have much better informed opinions on this. There is an interesting claim that the asymmetry in responsibility between left and right brain goes back 800 million years, that is that extremly simple creatures also have this asymetry.  The thesis is to simplify that the right part of the brain looks at generalities - one could call it context - and the left is geared more to precision, analytic, goal directed thought. The left hemisphere's focus helps the animal catch the prey, the right hemisphere helps the animal be aware of its surroundings to stop it from being prey.</p>\n<p>If this asymetry is so old, one may wonder if apart from being evolutionary based, which of course it has to be, if it is not also evolution discovering or using mathematical structures.</p>",
