Many mathematical topics which are considered more elementary than CT are actually more sophisticated in terms of ideas and reasoning (i.e. calculus is harder than basic CT, imho). Basic CT barely has any theorems!<br>\nTo be fair, this could be said of many areas of mathematics, albeit few have such a gentle learning curve as CT imho. Maybe there's a big Dirac delta at the beginning because of the diagrammatic reasoning, but after then it isn't steep at all (while, e.g., graph theory starts super-easy and then blows up)</p>",

Most of the newer books are much better about introducing things to a non-specialist audience (trust me, during my orbit, I've read a good number of them haha). I really like Seven Sketches, and I think it does a great job of showing the applications outside of pure math, but when I started it, I didn't have the math background, and unfortunately, I don't know if they do enough to cover the basic gadgets first, so I'm excited to reread it again after I feel more certain of the basics!

This is a trick that comes up again, for example, in vector spaces, where given X a vector space over a field F, its “elements” are the linear maps of type F → X (with F seen as a vector space over itself). You can recover the classical notion of element by applying such a map to 1, and noticing that its action on arbitrary elements is determined by its action on 1. (Take f : F → X. Note f(x) = f(x × 1) = xf(1).) This notion is expanded fully at <a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/generalized+element\">https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/generalized+element</a>.

Why not? 'Function' is certainly a noun, at least in mathematics, that is in some sense or other collective by itself. In a function from one set to another, it is the elements that are mapped to elements in another set.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The problem here seems to be that the word \"function\" is a count noun and singular in form, which leads to a grammatical \"disagreement\" between it and the quantifier \"all\" -- agreement in natural language is usually syntactically/morphologically rather than semantically/encyclopedically determined, as far as I know. :-)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thank you for your replay, Julio. Here's my question: Is there some type of functor from set functions to  directed information channels, and from sets to situations with possibilities as constituents? Or vice versa? Say, for applications in linguistics or pedagogy ...  </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2019/entries/situations-semantics/\">https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2019/entries/situations-semantics/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"#narrow/stream/229111-general/topic/learning.20CT/near/203379604\">https://categorytheory.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/229111-general/topic/learning.20CT/near/203379604</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You are welcome, Lee! Unfortunately I'm not familiar with such applications, so there might be some but I'm not aware of them.</p>",
