The methods are sort of category theory adjacent, being based on coalgebra and a little type theory, but it's applied to the philosophy of cognitive science / foundations of decision-making. None of us have ever published anything much like this before, and I was wondering if anyone in this community would know a suitable venue for it. Ideally we'd like to submit somewhere where the reviewers will understand coalgebraic reasoning, but at the same time it would be good to hit an audience that will be interested in the philosophical application. Does anything like that exist?</p>",
