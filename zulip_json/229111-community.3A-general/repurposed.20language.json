Many of the terms in sheaf theory come from wheat <span aria-label=\"upside down\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f643\" role=\"img\" title=\"upside down\">:upside_down:</span><br>\nBut generally speaking it serves mathematics well to use obscure words for familiar concepts to describe mathematical objects, for the simple reason that their obscurity avoids confusion of the technical intended meaning with the common meaning (while the latter is relevant since it hopefully provides intuition for the technical meaning). Terms like \"supine\" and \"prone\" which respectively mean 'upright' and 'lying down', are used by Johnstone to distinguish the vertical and horizontal components of morphisms in fibrations from alternative kinds of vertical/horizontal morphisms.</p>",
