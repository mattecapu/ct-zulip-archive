Probably this is not what we usually mean by applied category theory - which I think usually refers to applying category theory to areas like networked systems, computing science or very broadly science and engineering.</p>\n<p>However, I think it would be fascinating and instructive to read a book that explains how categorical ideas gradually worked their way into other areas of mathematics. Such a book could conceivably present a historical (non-categorical) approach to a topic parallel to a categorical treatment. Exercises could include practising translating statements between the two formalisms, and using insights from one approach to prove results stated in the language of the other approach.</p>\n<p>There are some introductory books to algebraic geometry that do a bit of this, I think? But these are still a bit too advanced for me to make much sense of.</p>",

At least it would probably have to be an intuitive exposition, not a proper text for learning the subject, and I don't know whether such a thing exists.</p>",
