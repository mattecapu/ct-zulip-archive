Just in case a question of 'what's categorical in it?' arises:<br>\nThe process of going from propositions to their corresponding combinations of questions and answers lends itself to be construed (on my superficial reading) as a functor going from the category S of sets (of propositions) to a category S/L of labelled sets, whose objects are functions: Questions --&gt; Answers, with Answers = {no, yes} as the labelling set L.  This functor S --&gt; S/L has an adjoint functor S/L --&gt; S.  Of course, there are groups and more that readily lend themselves to categorical readings.</p>",
