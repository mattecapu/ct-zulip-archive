        "content": "<p>Hello <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"*\">@everyone</span>, here is the first draft of the <strong>code of conduct</strong>. We welcome your thoughts.</p>\n<p>The Category Theory Community Server is a friendly, welcoming environment to learn and discuss category theory and its applications, as well as mathematics, science, and life.  As part of this, we welcome beginners and encourage teaching. Technical, research-related questions and discussions are also welcome.  </p>\n<p>Here are our policies for maintaining a friendly, open culture:</p>\n<p><strong>Engage in constructive discussion.</strong> Try to understand what others know and how they are thinking. We welcome researchers, beginners and everything in between, so try to respond on the level of the readers when possible. Encourage helpful members by acknowledging their contributions publicly. </p>\n<p><strong>Appreciate diversity and uplift one another.</strong> The group is large, and our varied backgrounds and strengths are valuable. Avoid getting frustrated by ambiguity, \"newbies\" and the like: either be helpful or move along. Be patient and take satisfaction from sharing knowledge.</p>\n<p><strong>Mind others’ time.</strong> Consider that 1000+ people may read any given discussion here. Make your contributions relevant and reasonably concise. A debate is okay if it is respectful and purposeful; otherwise steer the topic back on track or let it go. </p>\n<p><strong>Be nice.</strong> We have no tolerance for rudeness, insults, bullying, or ad hominem arguments. After one official warning, users engaging in these behaviors will be banned. If you see someone engaged in these behaviors, either respond very politely, ignore them, or send a private message to a moderator.</p>\n<p>Moderators:<br>\n<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"275920\">@John Baez</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"276438\">@Fabrizio Genovese</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"275899\">@Christian Williams</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"275932\">@Matteo Capucci</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"277473\">@[Mod] Morgan Rogers</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"275901\">@Jules Hedges</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"276092\">@Nathanael Arkor</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"275989\">@Paolo Perrone</span> </p>\n<p>If you are having any difficulty navigating Zulip, communicate this in any way you can and someone will surely find and help you.
