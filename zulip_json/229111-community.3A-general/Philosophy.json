I read parts of Brandom 10 years ago, but I can now see how much influence he has had on logic.  Here are some really interesting things I discovered recently</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Martin-L√∂f has been giving some excellent talks on how Constructive Type Theory should be understood dialogically. See the thread <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bblfish/status/1243650652963815424\" title=\"https://twitter.com/bblfish/status/1243650652963815424\">https://twitter.com/bblfish/status/1243650652963815424</a> (one has to ask Ansten Klev for the transcripts)</li>\n<li>A very good book I am reading now is \"Meaning in Dialogue\" from 2016 that covers the whole literature on the subject up to that point.  </li>\n<li>The Martin-L√∂f view is  is taken up by a book \"Immanent Reasoning and Equality in Action\" from 2018 that gives a precise dialogical explanation of CTT. HoTT can't be far away.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anyway it would be interesting to have views here if anyone has come across work in CT that goes in this direction, or goes against it.</p>\n<div class=\"inline-preview-twitter\"><div class=\"twitter-tweet\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bblfish/status/1243650652963815424\"><img class=\"twitter-avatar\" src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1004326761608417281/HjxjS9BX_normal.jpg\"></a><p>Finished the excellent \"Immanent Reasoning or Equality in Action\".
