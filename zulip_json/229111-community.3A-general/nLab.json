(The forum page with the shutdown announcement is now down, too.) Authors have been locked out of all their pages since (in particular I continue being locked out of my home page, please check by email whether information given there is still accurate, in case it matters).<br>\nThe currently remaining rudimentary page display is hence outdated, besides having been partially broken in the shutdown process; and readers should please beware that the nnLab pages they currently get to see have not been, are not being and cannot be maintained until further notice. (Some pages are not even displaying their latest content as of the shutdown moment anymore.)<br>\nRequests to at least post an alert to this effect on displayed pages have been turned down without reason; and a succession of announcements of system recovery have all passed without effect, instead further functionality has been switched off since. In short, the nnLab installation has de facto died on 29 Dec. 2021, and it is unclear if or when it will be revived in the future, and in which state of coherence or trustworthiness. Myself, I have unfortunately no control or command over the installation, having trusted in volunteer help on this crucial point.<br>\nA hard restart of the entire nnLab project seems to be necessary, and maybe there is some value to this, dire as it feels at this point. If anyone reading this sees themselves willing and capable to set up, host and administrate a research wiki vaguely like the nnLab was, possibly better, then please contact me.\"</p>",

You finance an institute or a startup to get a slice of the possible earnings. From this point of view financing the nlab is a bit of a dead end: It is not intrinsically novel per s√©, it's just a repository. Industry investors have little incentives to invest in something like this instead of moving their money towards something that deliver novel, exploitable research. The only incentive I can think of is philanthropy, which is a very rare thing to find lol</p>",

So I am less concerned about funding for hosting, and more about the larger funding required to get stable development and administration of the system itself.

        "content": "<p>Let me try to explain why I suggested Topos play a role, and also why I do not advocate that Topos per se play a role given the useful comments here. The Haskell Foundation and the Topos institute were launched at relatively similar times. Of course the two communities are very different, but within that setting they seemed to share some similar goals. In particular, at least initially, my understanding was that Topos could act as a centralizing body for \"general community infrastructure\" much as the HF aims to do, and has a similar goal of stabilizing core resources for a broader group. Now, it may be that's not the direction Topos is going in -- fine! But, the concern is again that there comes a certain point in which relying on individual volunteer work reaches its limits, and the stopgap solution is to scale up a bit the existing thing, but the real solution is necessarily going to involve some more regular funding that can pay not just for hardware costs (relatively cheap!) but for individuals to have the time to responsibly and consistently put in effort, and further, to establish some publicly known chain of ownership and responsibility, which involves an institution with some legal standing, and ideally with a 501(c) so it can handle nonprofit status for donations, and also have enough infrastructure to organize paying people. Ideally, you save some work by not having too many institutions which have to replicate that structure. But again, maybe Topos is not going to be that. My opinion is simply that, at a certain point, which is perhaps near, perhaps not, _something_ should be that, or, through no fault of any hardworking individual involved, there will be sporadic frustrating messes for want of such a thing.</p>\n<p>(and the point is not certainly that \"topos should pay\" but rather whatever centralizing institution is established can be a centralized conduit for funds and effort, in terms both of responsibility and synchronization, so that organizations can pay and know their funds are using in a fashion their administrators are comfortable is well accounted for)</p>",
