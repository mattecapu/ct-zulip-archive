We would like to kindly ask you to help us distribute the call through your network.</p>\n<p>In the last few editions, the number of submissions for CALCO has declined; this is in part due to the success of the core community in publishing in broader conferences such as LICS, FoSSaCS, POPL... We must be proud that the community has reached this level of maturity, yet we must take action to make sure CALCO continues to thrive. We have ensure that this year we broaden the topics and the PC has also been chosen intentionally to broaden the scope of CALCO. </p>\n<p>Increasing the number of submissions is important to ensure we continue being able to publish the proceedings with LIPIcs, which is a well-known open-access venue for the proceedings of top-class conferences. The agreement with LIPIcs is currently under review and if we cannot show a change in trend we are at serious risk of losing it, which would be a real shame for the conference. We therefore ask you to help us in this endeavour of ensuring we can remain within LiPICS and that we can continue thriving as a community!</p>\n<p>Forgive us the highly unorthodox mail, but in troubling times we must pull together... and together we can do great things!</p>\n<p>All the best, stay safe, Fabio and Alexandra</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>CALCO is a nice conference, and it is a pity that they are in this situation. If you have something to submit, please do! Here's the link!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://easychair.org/cfp/CALCO2021\">https://easychair.org/cfp/CALCO2021</a></p>",
