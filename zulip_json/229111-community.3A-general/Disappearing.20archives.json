(can a theorem that you mentioned on facebook be used to predict your political afiliation?)</p>\n<p>** note the name of <em>hypatia</em>. libraries are sometimes murdered for a purpose. we know 5 tragedies by aeschyllus, and i think about 80 titles, but there were allegedly 200 of them in the catalog. one more godless than the other. destroying the web as the tower of babel will undoubtedly become an attractive proposition. eg to disrupt a global conspiracy of category theorists. and it might be not as hard as it used to be. the original internet was designed to survive the fragmentation in case of a nuclear war. but a network resilient to fragmentation is suboptimal for monetizing...</p>\n<p>** memory is based on forgetting (cf funes the memorious). if you record all that happens, it all becomes noise. how should the web select what to remember? ants amplify shorter paths using pheromons. dropbox can drop unused links...</p>\n<p>QUESTIONS:</p>\n<p>1) what might be a good architecture for a community to store old archives. should everyone donate a bit of memory, and someone writes a simple private cloud module? also multiparty?</p>\n<p>2) how should a network version of long term memory be managed?</p>\n<p>thoughts?</p>",

For me \"resilient\", in this particular case, means \"decentralized\". Which means that as long as at least one person seeds the files, it cannot be shut down. The issue of hosting community, \"public\" files on platforms as arXiv and github is that they are owned by someone, be it a university or a private company. And this someone can decide to shut everything down and leave everyone hanging.</p>",

I'd say the first three TWFs are <em>done</em>, and two more are \"basically\" done, only needing ASCII graphics to be redrawn in TikZ.  So \"the first 5 or so\" was actually remarkably accurate.  I did a bit of Spring cleaning, so the Overleaf project I started for TWF is a little bit more organized than it was a week ago, but it'll probably be later this month when I'll have time to make another appreciable dent.</p>",
