This is what led me to look more closely at dialogical views of logic, which led me to complement topoi. I am also want to look at Session types (I watched <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px38U3jsOLQ\" title=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px38U3jsOLQ\">Two sides of the same coin: Session Types and Game Semantics</a>.</p>\n<p>Anyone here have some idea of something else I should look at? Or a good paper that I should read in this space?</p>",
