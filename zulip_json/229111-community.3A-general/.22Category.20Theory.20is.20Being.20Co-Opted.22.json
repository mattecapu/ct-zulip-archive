I'll quote more:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Perhaps the most sophisticated form of co-option is not outright rejection but selective adoption. The mathematical establishment has become adept at incorporating the <em>language</em> and <em>diagrams</em> of category theory in a way that gives the appearance of progress while leaving the foundational philosophy of set theory entirely untouched. It is now common to speak of the category of sets (<strong>Set</strong>), the category of groups (<strong>Grp</strong>), or the category of topological spaces (<strong>Top</strong>).</p>\n<p>This practice is a Trojan horse. On the surface, it seems to embrace the categorical perspective. In reality, it does the opposite. By defining categories whose objects are themselves structures built axiomatically within ZFC (a group is a specific kind of set with a binary operation, etc.), it reinforces the idea that set theory is the fundamental, substance-providing layer of mathematics, while category theory is a secondary, descriptive layer that deals with the relationships <em>between</em> these set-based objects.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, I don't think the key revolutionary goal of category theory should be for it to overcome set theory as the \"substance-providing layer\" of mathematics.   And I think the stakes in applied category theory are much higher than anything one could say about the ontology of mathematics.</p>",

A proposal to \"use categorical methods to solve a problem in X\" is far more legible and fundable than a proposal to \"explore the philosophical foundations of X using topos theory.\"  This system doesn't need to be hostile to foundational work; it simply starves it of resources by rewarding incremental, tool-oriented research.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The Career Filter:</strong> This incentive structure shapes academic careers. Young mathematicians, facing the pressure to publish and secure tenure, are rationally incentivized to work on well-defined problems within the established paradigm, where success is recognizable and rewarded.  Exploring a new philosophical foundation is a high-risk, slow-burn endeavor that the career structure implicitly discourages.   </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The result is a system where the evolution of mathematics is subtly guided by the needs of its primary consumers. The deep philosophical questions are not suppressed; they are simply sidelined by a pragmatic culture that values mathematics for what it can <em>do</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All this is of course perfectly normal for fields of mathematics: they are unsubtly guided by the needs of their consumers.   Some fields like mathematical physics wear this proudly on their sleeve.   So what do the authors think is \"bad\" about all this?   Clearly they consider the <em>philosophical</em> significance of category theory to be its key virtue that's subtly being suppressed through its adoption as a mere means to an end.   </p>\n<p>It will be interesting to see if the appearance of books like <em><a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/book/35959\">Categories for the Working Philosopher</a></em> declines, or even increases, as category theory continues to go mainstream.</p>\n<p>My own concern about \"co-opting\" is different: it's about the application of category theory for bad ends.  This too is perfectly normal for fields of mathematics.   But I still think we should still fight it.</p>",

Here we see an articulation of how the mathematical formalisms at our disposal shape what we are able to talk about and account for in science more broadly, and dually which aspects become \"externalities\" (to borrow an economics term) -- things we are unable to properly reason about within our formalisms.<br>\nSomeone said to me recently, \"Tell me how constructive mathematics is used to make bombs,\" as a way of dismissing the idea that war in general (and the genocide in Gaza sepcifically) has anything to do with their work, and so shutting down discussion of it. There may be an actual direct answer to their demand; I haven't looked into it because even I would rather not know(!), but a now-banned participant in this Zulip had a habit of rubbing people's faces in the military applications of their work. It is happening!<br>\nFor me the specifics of the connection and how direct it is are secondary: even if I manage to convince myself that I have minimized my own responsibility for something, that leaves plenty of room for discussing how we may be able to act collectively to actively reduce the negative impacts of the thing that do concern us, even if the only answer we come up with is to continue our theoretical work in a conscientious way, or redirect our efforts in that work to try to make neglected concepts expressible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is a mythos within pure mathematics that in part I believe helps keep people in this mindset that they are exempt from real-world consequences of their research. Every math undergrad is told that pure mathematics research is at minimum 50 years off from applications. The attitudes embedded in the culture of pure math enable and encourage people to believe this. The point is well-made by that banned guy that however fancy your math is, there's someone in the US DOD (I guess DOW now) who has a phd in your topic and is reading your papers between meetings on increasing efficiency in their search-and-kill systems. I think this sort of touches on Mike's point of two definitions of co-opt. Nobody is taking control of category theory, this is nonsensical. But people are incorporating into their work, and some of them might be doing things you don't like with your work. Of course I don't conclude from this that people shouldn't engage in pure math research. I do think it's irresponsible to do so without making yourself aware of these avenues. I don't believe there is a route towards preventing people from using your research to do things you don't want within the realms of science or academia.

The essay that started this thread is attempting to do exactly that.</li>\n<li>We are not only applicants to sources of funding or producers of publications but also the expert referees of proposals and papers, so depending on how much of the latter responsibilities we take on, we can have some influence in the \"right\" direction (for a subjective value of \"right\" which is nonetheless heavily community-influenced). Of course, the power that one has in those systems is determined by experience and degree of conformity, which limits long-term impacts.</li>\n<li>We have individual lobbying ability which is significantly strengthened by our position of expertise. An MP/representative may only learn of deteriorating conditions in, say, public higher education institutions if we tell them about it or encourage our students to do so. They may similarly only learn of the unexpected connections between our research and military applications if we tell them about it (and tell them that we don't want it).</li>\n<li>A second-degree point of contact for having an influence are journalists, policy consultants/advisers. Some academics dip their toes into those networks when they consider leaving or when they achieve wild success. They are a conduit for communicating with a wider and more influential audience not only what your research does and what it may mean for society to support it, but the structure of the research community which is largely invisible from the outside.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I reckon that the times when fundamental research has received the biggest expansion of support in it's own right has been on occasions when it has been championed by people through these and other routes.

If your theory is based on sets you're at least as correct as sets; if your program is based on x86 you can at least run on x86 computers.

Isn't there a set, or at least a class, of arrows in between any two objects, and aren't the objects also a class? How are you going to state what it means to take the Yoneda lemma as an axiom if you don't already have a category of sets? There are some answers to these kinds of questions, but most aren't very satisfying and none are completely satisfying, I think it's fair to say; the farther you get from starting with a well-pointed $$(\\infty)-$$topos with lots of coproducts, the less plausible it is that you can rebuild math this way.</p>\n<p>I don't really think type theory gets you that far away from set theory, as far as the aesthetics of a foundation go. A type is still a collection of things--it's just an intensional collection, rather than an extensional one.

He posed two criteria: similarity/dissimilarity and interiority/physicality; which give four classes (translated from the french <a href=\"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par-del%C3%A0_nature_et_culture\">wikipedia article</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>animism: similar interiorities, dissimilar physicalities.

E.g., Australia.</li>\n<li>naturalism: dissimilar interiorities, similar physicalities. Key concept: objectivation. E.g. Occident (our western culture).</li>\n<li>analogism: dissimilar interiorities, dissimilar physicalities. Key concept: chain of beings. E.g. Brahmanic India, West Africa [...]</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems that the human tendency to describe the world in terms of collection of things is mostly a modern western tendency (naturalism). So set theory would be \"naturalistic\". </p>\n<p>I am wondering now how various mathematical theories confront to this \"civilization classification\". </p>\n<p>ps: Descola's book is <a href=\"https://dn720001.ca.archive.org/0/items/beyond-nature-and-culture/Beyond%20Nature%20and%20Culture.pdf\">Beyond nature and culture</a></p>",

I've skimmed through Descola's <a href=\"https://dn720001.ca.archive.org/0/items/beyond-nature-and-culture/Beyond%20Nature%20and%20Culture.pdf\">book</a>, and will try to answer your questions.</p>\n<p>To be more precise, Descola classifies modes of identifications. Here identification means establishing differences and resemblances between myself and other entities, by inferring analogies or contrasts between appearance, behavior or properties I ascribe to myself, and those I ascribe to them. </p>\n<p>Two kinds of such properties are \"interiority\" and \"physicality\". Interiority encompasses features such as having a mind, soul or consciousness, or a subjectivity, reflexivity, feelings, or immaterial things such as breath or vital energy. In contrast, physicality includes the external form, substance, the physiological and sensorimotor processes, the morphology or anatomical characteristics.</p>\n<p>Once these identifications are posed, I can develop many relations wrt these entities (e.g. predation, friendship, etc.), which can be translated to concrete social norms.</p>\n<p>Animists ascribe to non-humans an interiority similar to their own. Hence, a bird has a mind, a subjectivity, an intentionality which does not differ from mine much than from another human being. However, their bodies are \"obviously\" different: birds have feathers, fish scales, and so on. </p>\n<p>Naturalists, on the other hand, don't recognize any interiority to non-humans. Humans are special as they are the only entities to have received a soul, an intentionality, an ability to signify using language, etc. However, our bodies, those of animals, and rocks, and so on, are made of the same stuff (we used to think this stuff was springs and pneumatic devices, now we think it is atoms, molecules, etc.). I think Descartes' animal machine provides a good example of naturalist thinking. </p>\n<p>It seemed to me that the \"object-centric worldview\" that has been mentioned earlier fit in the naturalistic mind: there is a nature out there, a collection of objects, which our bodies are part of, that we can observe, and infer laws about. But the non-human objects don't have interiorities, and thus don't receive any civic or moral statutes.</p>\n<p>Then, I was too hasty when I said that set theory would then be \"naturalistic\": I don't have a definite argument to support it.</p>",
