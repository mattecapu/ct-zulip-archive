The target audience is graduate students who have either already taken a first course in category theory or more realistically have self-studied the material on their own. Most talks are expository and are often given by someone who is learning the topic for the first time. Interruptions to ask questions are highly encouraged.</p>\n<p>We wanted to keep the seminar small scale, to save time for other things, so there are only eight talks with no plans to add more (this term at least). But all are welcome to attend and learn along with us. The schedule can be found on either of these websites:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://researchseminars.org/seminar/blue-jay-cat\">https://researchseminars.org/seminar/blue-jay-cat</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://www.math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/ct/\">http://www.math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/ct/</a></p>\n<p>Note <a href=\"http://researchseminars.org\">researchseminars.org</a> has a link that will take you into the zoom room (in the lower right hand corner on the announcement for each talk).</p>\n<p>Questions?
