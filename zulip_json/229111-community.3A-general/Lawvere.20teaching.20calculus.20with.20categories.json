Therefore, in spite of already having decided that the category of categories is the appropriate framework for mathematics in general, I spent several preparatory weeks trying to devise a calculus course based on Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. However, a sober assessment showed that there are far too many layers of definitions, concealing differentiation and integration from the cumulative hierarchy, to be able to get through those layers in a year. The category structure of Cantor's structureless sets seemed both simpler and closer. Thus, the <em>Elementary Theory of the Category of Sets</em> arose from a purely practical educational need, in a sort of experience that Saunders also noted: the need to explain daily for students is often the source of new mathematical<br>\ndiscoveries.</p>\n</blockquote>",
