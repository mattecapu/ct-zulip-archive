Furthermore, we are very anxious about others making use of this gold-mine for evil.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Mathematics is only one field of knowledge - there's also medicine, engineering, sociology, physics, geography, computer science, and so on, most of which seem more directly useful for solving global challenges than mathematics. And even within mathematics, there is discrete mathematics, probablity theory, mathematical optimization, calculus, and so on, which also have great potential for being applied. What makes ACT so special compared to all of these other fields when it comes to solving \"the world's most pressing issues\"?</p>\n<p>Honestly this exaggerated advertising of ACT seems a bit ridiculous to me.

Is it to represent people who cannot speak for themselves, to attract business … or a subtle form of self-aggrandizement?  </p>\n<p>I don’t mean these as fake questions or criticisms at all, but I do think they deserve careful self-reflection.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why is separation of the personal from the professional important for my clients to trust me?  I am very skeptical of this distinction --- math is in some sense a vocation for me, not just a job.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you’re serious about it, you’ll need to be able to put in the work even when you don’t feel like it, because you promised someone you would, without making it personal — eg ask for what you need when problems arise with minimal emotional labor from your client / collaborator.  </p>\n<p>Your self worth must not ride on always knowing more category theory (or anything else), or on someone else’s approval.  It is independent of work, allowing you to be reliable and explore uncertainty.</p>\n<p>Let’s consider what others need to help motivate it…</p>\n<p>Let’s say I am a business or personal coming to you, considering paying you to work on my challenging problem.   In doing so I will have to reveal things my competitors could use against me.  I also need to feel safe enough to admit when I don’t know things, which later might become quite important.  So clients need discretion and privacy, and they highly value predictability.  </p>\n<p>Regarding the last, clients want to know that you will not suddenly decide they are “Bad” and then violate all those contracts of trust, or abandon the project for some kind of intensely personal reason they will find it very hard to predict or avoid.  This is especially true in small business where lawsuits are just not an accessible expense.</p>\n<p>When there is no separation of personal and professional, there is no demonstrated ability to do these things.  It makes the calculus of whether to engage with you <em>so much harder</em> and forces the client to think of all kinds of potential ramifications… serious + stable + honest people will probably just default to “no”.</p>\n<p>But equally if not more  importantly, the ability to separate really forces <em>you</em> to get clear with yourself about what your boundaries and intentions are.  About what you can actually promise and follow through with.</p>\n<p>I <em>dont mean you split yourself</em>.

Nobody who decides to be the millionth cog doing incremental improvements in machine learning or whatever needs to spend a second of their time justifying their field. Certainly I do not enjoy having to respond to questions about \"the power of category theory\" and I believe 95% of what is construed as \"hype\" around ACT is done begrudgingly by researchers who would much rather spend their time proving theorems.</p>",

Getting people to change their behavior is also a systemic problem which doesn't lend itself easily to one-approach-fits-all technocratic solutions like what is being promised here. </p>\n<p>Economic systems, governance systems, educational systems, etc are systems which are fraught with many complex political and sociological factors and many self-interested actors who are interested in the system for their own selfish reasons, and many actors who have beliefs for how the systems themselves should work that differ significantly from applied category theory. Most of the solutions to the systemic problems are unwieldy compromises between different factions of society which just barely work in reality but contain many aspects which each faction do not like. </p>\n<p>I don't think that the niche field of applied category theory will itself solve the problems in most of these systems, compared to actually existing forces in society like political parties, mass media, corporations, non-government organisations, and so on. At best, applied category theory becomes one of many tools used by all sides of the never-ending fights in human society, by American corporations, Russian private military companies, the Chinese Communist Party, warlords in Africa, both the Israeli government and Hamas, et cetera, some of whom will purposefully apply category theory to prevent problems from being solved.</p>",

With climate change activism there is a sense of apocalyptic fear rather than political correctness, apocalyptic fear that humans are going to go extinct; it reminds me more of the apocalyptic fear and rhetoric on some portions of the European right that mass immigration is going to cause the extinction of Europeans, and then promoting desperate unrealistic solutions to mass immigration like genociding all non-Europeans, which has many of the same distastful anti-human vibe to it as some of the climate change movement's rhetoric today. Like, yes, climate change is a huge issue that humans have to learn to adapt to and aim to reduce, and immigration is a huge issue that Europeans will have to figure out how to reduce down to levels suitable for Europe, but using extreme rhetoric about humans or Europeans going extinct will simply turn people away from their cause.</p>",

        "content": "<p>In psychology there is a phenomenon where one gets better results influencing people's behavior if one phrases communication in terms of \"I\" rather than \"You\": I feel bad when dinner goes cold vs you make dinner go cold by coming home late.  You-messages immediately put the other person on the defensive.  Similarly, with a \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_we\">royal we</a>\" the audience is immediately put on the defensive: do they self-identify as part of your \"we\" or not?  As a matter of scientific writing, unless you are referring to a group of authors of size &gt; 1, 'we' creates more ambiguity than it clarifies.  (fwiw I also find polemics off-putting in a professional context, but support free speech rabidly)</p>",

The vast majority of the traffic to my site actually seems to have been coming from this very thread</p>",
