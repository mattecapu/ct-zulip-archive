First of all, they get an education, which means they have been taught standards and trained in the subject matter style. A mathematician trained in an official institution is trusted because we trust the people who trained them, and the overall system of mathematical production. Secondly, human mathematicians stake their reputation within a community in their publications. A machine does not have either of these, and their throughput is too high to cut them slack by checking their output manually every time, IMO. Hence Riehl's mechanisation requirement is very reasonable.</p>",

What is much harder to verify than correctness is importance, something which LLMs seem to have a deep-seated tendency to wildly overstate. For any paper that’s not simply the proof of an already-formalized theorem which people already really want, which would seem to me to be a very small slice of papers (and even then as the ABC saga shows, explaining the novel concepts introduced to support the proof is a heavy task) one has to answer the “why do I care?” question before the “is it correct?” question even becomes relevant. At this point, I honestly think it’s ontologically impossible for the machine on its own to provide justification for why I should care. A human mathematician collaborating with a machine for constructing definitions and proofs will have to take responsibility for their paper’s argument for its significance just as fully as they do for papers today. I think this pretty well implies that you shouldn’t even try to let a machine draft those parts of your paper.</p>",

I share everyone's skepticism about the ability of AI to <em>find</em> interesting mathematics on its own, even if it could generate a formalized proof of the correctness of what it found.  But what about an AI that can read a proof written by a human in mathematical English -- or, even better, a high-level sketch of such a proof -- and generate a formalized version of that proof?  And it wouldn't have to be a one-way process, either: if you try writing something and the AI fails to formalize it, it could gloss the proof assistant's error messages back to natural language to try to give you some idea of what went wrong and how to fix it.</p>",
