I am curious if there is any remaining documentation of the conference (program, list of attendees, etc), or if there is a successor to this conference in spirit/theme. The title (geometry of computation) sounds interesting enough for me to want to dig more into this, and there is at least one file of a presentation/notes that I've come across that seems to originate here (I cannot find it today for some reason)</p>",

        "content": "<p>Geocal06 was epic!  As a PhD student in Luminy, I lived in student housing on campus back then, so I was able to attend the whole 5 weeks.  I have great memories of it <span aria-label=\"slight smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"slight smile\">:slight_smile:</span></p>\n<p>A couple of years ago I found a CD on a dusty book shelf in my department which might have contained some material (like the abstracts of the talks and such).  I'll see if I can find it again, but I do not guarantee anything because we are currently undergoing a major move and stuff like that is very likely to have been thrown away during clean-up and packing.</p>\n<p>In any case, if you don't see what you're looking for on the website found by Valeria, I encourage you to contact <a href=\"https://www.i2m.univ-amu.fr/perso/laurent.regnier/\">Laurent Regnier</a>, my former PhD advisor and one of the main organizers of Geocal06.  He might still have written material from the workshops.</p>\n<p>So far there have been two follow-ups, called \"Logic and Interactions\", organized in the same place and with roughly the same format:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://li2012.univ-mrs.fr/\">Logic and Interactions 2012</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://conferences.cirm-math.fr/2507.html\">Logic and Interactions 2022</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both very nice events but in my opinion none of them of the caliber of Geocal06.</p>",
