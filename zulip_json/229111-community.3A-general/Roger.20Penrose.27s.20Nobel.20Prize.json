The version of the theorem that deals with an initial singularity (\"inevitability of the big bang\", as it were) really covers a different physical phenomenon. Someone else I was talking to who worked with Penrose at Oxford reckons Hawking had \"made enemies\" and so there was opposition to him getting such an awardâ€”I don't really know about that, but it highlights how ... human the whole process is.</p>",
