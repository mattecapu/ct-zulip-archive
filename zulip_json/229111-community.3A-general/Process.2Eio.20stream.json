It is a channel I created where users of the (currently still private) beta can ask questions. Feel free to lurk, I'll post occasional updates and we should be opening invites at some point. The <a href=\"https://process.io\">https://process.io</a> platform builds on top of <a href=\"https://statebox.org\">https://statebox.org</a> probably familiar to most of you. In short, it will allow you to write software that is structured diagrammatically, using petri nets, monoidal categories and a whole bunch of more stuff.</p>",
