Nowadays we see this as completely ridiculous and much of group theory is perceived as very basic undergraduate-level mathematics. I sometime relate this story to skeptical computer scientists as a cautionary tale that they are only holding themselves back by being resistant to manifestly useful abstractions in our field.</p>\n<p>I have a linguistic question though. I don't speak German, so what would the analogous term for category theory? Would it be \"Kategoriepest\"?</p>",
