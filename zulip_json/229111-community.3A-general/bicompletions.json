This is a subtlety in the topos construction that Mike mentions: if there are any non-stable colimits in the original category, they will be \"forced into submission\" in the sense that they will become isomorphic to the \"right\" colimits after the embedding, at which point the Yoneda embedding no longer factors through the resulting subtopos of the category of presheaves.</p>\n<p>A ring has two binary operations, but the construction of free rings imposes distributivity of multiplication over addition; this is analogous to colimits being stable under pullback, in a precise sense. The conclusion of the above could be paraphrased as the statement that if I have a collection of element with partially defined multiplication and addition I can complete it to a ring where multiplication distributes over addition.

((the outputs of any real gauges are always rational numbers, because they are read by counting. but you can repeat a measurement unbounded number of times, and get sequence of rational numbers, and estimate where it converges. so you really need the real numbers which satisfy the above properties. if they do not satsify the first one, then approximating from above, and approximating from below may lead to different results. if they do not satisfy the second one, then the choices of the apparatus, or of one of the different completions that may exist, may lead to different results. to support testable theories of nature, mathematics must be based on completions that satisfy the above requirements.))</p>\n<p>now suppose that your measurements do not just output some counts, but also some relationships. e.g. you are tracking sarah's and dusko's behaviors in some chat vault that you set up for them, and you do not just count how many times do they perform this or that action, but also how they map the counts of the measurements that you see them make into the behaviors towards one another, and towards others. your observations are now not just partially ordered, but there are some morphisms between them. so now the information context from which you start is not a poset, but a category. </p>\n<p>if you use limits and colimits as the generalization of infima and suprema, then you should be able to embed this category into a complete and cocomplete category, so that any diagram of observations can be logically aggregated. any limits and colimits that existed in the old category must be preserved. any new limits and colimits must be uniquely determined by the data in your original category. otherwise the observer will not be extracting a model of sarah's and dusko's behaviors, but an autoportrait of their own choices.</p>\n<p>if you stick with counting, but take the integers not as an order but as the category of finite sets (albeit ordered, if you prefer the simplicial approach) -- then you can construct the rationals as a category as well try to complete it --- under limits and colimits, if you take them as the logical tools for your aggregations. and then you discover that there is no way to satisfy both of the above requirements. </p>\n<p>that was the content of an old controversy between lambek and isbell. it was taken as the information about the properties of limits and colimits. but besides the properties of some given operations, there are also some given tasks, eg required by the logic of science. the point here is that the two don't match.</p>\n<p>it is of course tempting to declare victory, and to claim that limits and colimits are universal categorical operations, and that this or that medicine cures this or that disease (or even all of them). but it is more fun to recognize what needs to be done, and to try to find a way to do it.</p>",

But overall, I would expect that the parameters of the problem and the information you want to store would dictate what category you should be working in to capture the information you want.  For instance, some people use categories to represent databases, starting with a small diagram category (e.g. an algebraic theory) representing the schema.  The resulting category whose objects are instances of the schema is, in the literal sense, a \"choice\" of how to extend the schema to a bicomplete category, but it's the <em>correct</em> choice because it captures the desired information: a model of the algebraic theory <em>is</em> what we intend to mean by an instance of the schema.  I would expect that something similar is true in your case: among all the bicompletions, one of them is the correct choice for your purpose.</p>",

I don't know for sure but I would have thought that if the reals were just the completion of the rationals in this way then that would be one of the standard constructions of the reals, rather than having to do all the hard work with Dedekind cuts or Cauchy sequences?</p>\n<p>If you makes enough choices about what properties you want your completion (<a href=\"#narrow/stream/229199-learning.3A-basic.20questions/topic/Categorifying.20algebraic.20structures/near/194913429\" title=\"#narrow/stream/229199-learning.3A-basic.20questions/topic/Categorifying.20algebraic.20structures/near/194913429\">or generalisation, or categorification...</a>) operation to have, you will eventually end up with a canonical choice, or if you're too fussy no choice at all (in the sense that no construction can meet all of your specifications). I'm more or less just repeating was Mike was saying here, though.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>you seem to be asking me to tell you what is in Dedekind's Zahlenschrift. it is a very easy and elegant read, and an english translation surely exists. if you construct real numbers as a complertion, then they obviously have to have a maximum and a minimum element. in dedekind's time, they used to typeset the maximum element by putting the number 8 on its side... the whole story lifts to arbitrary posets, in a little paper by MacNeille, and there is a think a very short and simple section in johnstone's spaces book. a thorough analysis of the consequences and uses of such tight bicompletions is in a paper by Banaschewski and someone else.</p>",

But overall, I would expect that the parameters of the problem and the information you want to store would dictate what category you should be working in to capture the information you want.  For instance, some people use categories to represent databases, starting with a small diagram category (e.g. an algebraic theory) representing the schema.  The resulting category whose objects are instances of the schema is, in the literal sense, a \"choice\" of how to extend the schema to a bicomplete category, but it's the <em>correct</em> choice because it captures the desired information: a model of the algebraic theory <em>is</em> what we intend to mean by an instance of the schema.  I would expect that something similar is true in your case: among all the bicompletions, one of them is the correct choice for your purpose.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>if we go down this road, we will start discussing whether there is a place for some sort of antropic principle in mathematics: should the computational outputs of a mathematical theory depend on mathematicians' free will? if the answer is no, i win. if the answer is yes, then i yield my free choice of the answer to john baez.</p>\n<p>sorry, john already explained that i sometimes have trouble taking things seriously. but this one really can't be serious. categorical structures are not things which can be attacked or defended. they don't have any moral content. they do things or they don't do things. limits and colimits play their role where they play their role, but they are not the answer the all questions. maybe my examples are not good, but there are surely other. such is the nature of science. so when we notice a question that they don't answer, then we shouldn't attack the question, but look for the answer. for instance, what is the categorifiction of the real numbers? it would be nice to get a category where the multiplication is a tensor, and the addition the biproduct, so that you can estract the linear operators from a matrix as kan extensions. how about that? (there will have to be some refinement of limits in there.)</p>",
