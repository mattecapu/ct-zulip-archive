There are also 6000 more pages of material on other subjects which might eventually also make their way into it, as they either serve as either illustrating examples or stepping stones.</p>\n<p>Here are some links:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The website: <a href=\"https://clowderproject.com\">https://clowderproject.com</a></li>\n<li>The GitHub project with the source files: <a href=\"https://github.com/topological-modular-forms/the-clowder-project\">link</a></li>\n<li>Everything currently released in PDF form: <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/topological-modular-forms/clowder-project-output/master/tags-book/alegreya-sans-tcb.pdf\">link</a></li>\n<li>The Discord server for the project, for discussions and updates: <a href=\"https://discord.gg/b98uG2MWgc\">link</a></li>\n</ul>",

I think because we had decided to go for the undergrad maths domain, instead of the category theory one associated with TAC. it certainly makes sense!</p>",
