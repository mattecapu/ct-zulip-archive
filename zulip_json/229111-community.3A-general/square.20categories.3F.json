The reason one might want to do that is to put the focus on commutative squares as being the basic object of study by making them front-and-center. It is of course possible to study them in other ways, but that means picking them out (perhaps using some kind of predicate), which is awfully indirect.</p>\n<p>Certainly one lesson that I've learned is that every single layer of 'encoding' that's done to study things tends to obscure the results somewhat.</p>",
