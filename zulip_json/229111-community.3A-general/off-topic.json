I know many people are not used to do research \"in public\", and prefer to make their results public only when they have a paper, but I am finding this open approach really refreshing: There are no attribution problems since everything is public and moreover everyone interested can chime in and add something useful, making research more productive.

Back then no one in the IRC channels I lurked into was ending sentences with a period (unless they were pissed for something). Clearly I got this kind of imprinting. It's weird because in non-chat written text (forums, papers, books, etc) I'd consider a sentence ending without a period as totally savage :D</p>",

Including periods can be taken to imply that you went to extra effort to end your sentence, instead of using a message-end, which would have done just as well! It can feel as though the writer wants this to be the last word on the subject, and wants you to know it.</p>\n<p>But I definitely think it also depends on the form of the words and thoughts involved: long paragraphs are maybe expected to have punctuation breaks, so it’s not unusual if they also end with punctuation. Plus, there are many other opportunities in a paragraph to gauge tone! (Like that exclamation point just there, or the way I tend to word things—is it reflective of a person sharing their thoughts and engaging in conversation, e.g. “I think”, or am I simply stating facts bluntly?)</p>\n<p>I think the “period -&gt; terseness” inference applies mainly when messages are short and convey one particular point. Then it can be read as condescension, because of the inferred sense that this is all that needs to be said on the subject!</p>",
