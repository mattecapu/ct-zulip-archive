You can't just have it do a big lump of work that you don't know how to check and get it checked afterwards and expect the result to be anything but worthless.</p>\n<p>Further, asking professional researchers to check \"your\" research that was done by ChatGPT is looking down on them, and even asking ChatGPT to do the things you ask of it is arrogant on your part.  You're trying to get credit for being a \"researcher\", or perhaps trying to drive research agendas, when you're only actually doing what amounts to brainstorming, which is less than 10% of the work of research when you do it correctly, and way less than that if you don't understand enough to know when the ideas you come up with are any good.  If you want to be a researcher, put in the work and become capable of understanding the concepts you're trying to use.  There are plenty of university programs, and plenty of free learning materials for the autodidact.  If you're not capable of doing that, there are many ways to contribute to the world other than research.</p>",

In my experience, LLMs are not as helpful as one might hope for this purpose. Specifically, they tend to give very \"zoomed out\" conceptual ideas  - and struggle to give precise details and examples that would help these vague ideas really come to life! They also tend to lose track of what exactly they were talking about, contradicting themselves in somewhat subtle ways in longer conversations. That quickly becomes a roadblock if one presses an LLM for details on some big picture idea it has.</p>\n<p>If you would like to develop your research skills, I think learning from a human is still (by far!) the best way. Personally, I have found it quite helpful to ask questions relating to specific exercises in areas of interest on this zulip. Working through a specific problem in detail is a lot of work, and is less exciting in some ways than trying to dream up new research ideas. But I think the practice it gives with \"zooming in\" - seeing how abstract concepts can be realized in very specific examples/theorems/definitions - can be quite valuable for the goal of doing research in the future.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I am finding Claude Opus 4.5 to be useful in research, e.g. after a long and detailed conversation it more or less volunteered to write a Python program to find 5-limit intervals that are as close to 1 as possible for a given Tenney height.   (If you don't know the definitions of those terms, and you care, you can read them on my <a href=\"https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2026/01/28/tiny-musical-intervals/\">blog article</a> about this program.)   I realized later that the program is flawed, in that the search domain was not large enough to be sure that the answer is right.  But Claude announced it was going to search that domain and I okayed it thinking that the resulting answer would be close to correct.   I checked some of the results and they look reasonable.   I should go ahead and fix the program to expand the search domain, but even now it was a valuable step forward.   </p>\n<p>I'm also finding it helpful to use Claude to learn mathematics - right now, the mathematics of regular tuning systems as developed by Gene Ward Smith, an algebraist I knew slightly, who died of COVID in 2021, whose writings on music theory are unfortunately unpublished, and scattered in a number of chat forums and wikis.    I learned about 'Tenney height' from Claude, and now I'm learning about other concepts, and it's a lot of fun.</p>\n<p>However, in my interaction with Claude I'm constantly questioning it when I don't completely understand something, or doubt something, and comparing its calculations to my own, and comparing its definitions to those I can find elsewhere.   And I am not eager to have it make large-scale decisions about what to do.</p>\n<p>Here's a sample interaction:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>JB: Is a temperament the kind of surjective homomophism you mentioned, or merely its kernel, as I first guessed?</p>\n<p>Claude: That's a good question, and I think I was being imprecise.</p>\n<p>Two homomorphisms with the same kernel can differ by an automorphism of the target. If φ: ℤⁿ → ℤʳ and ψ: ℤⁿ → ℤʳ have the same kernel, then ψ = A ∘ φ for some A ∈ GL(r, ℤ).</p>\n<p>In the regular temperament paradigm, I believe the standard usage is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The <strong>temperament</strong> is the kernel (or equivalently, the equivalence class of homomorphisms sharing that kernel). This is what the wedgie captures invariantly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A <strong>mapping</strong> is a specific homomorphism—a choice of how to express the temperament in terms of generators. The \"standard icon\" [⟨1 2 4|, ⟨0 −1 −4|] on Gene Ward Smith's page is a mapping: it tells you not just which commas vanish, but which specific generators to use (period and fourth).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Different mappings for the same temperament correspond to different choices of basis for ℤʳ—i.e., different choices of generators. For meantone, you could use (octave, fifth) or (octave, fourth) or (octave, major second); these give different mappings but the same temperament.</p>\n<p>So my earlier statement \"a temperament is a surjective homomorphism\" was too strong. The temperament is really just the kernel; the homomorphism (mapping) is additional structure you impose when you want to work with specific generators.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In short, I caught it in a mistake, and it fessed up.</p>\n<p>(The term 'wedgie' sounds silly, but it's an invention of Gene Ward Smith, who used wedge products to describe submodules of ℤʳ.)</p>",

I'm only offering to critique the mathematics, however, since while I do have a physics degree, I'm not going to charge anyone money for my thoughts there, even if I can understand the physics, since I don't call myself a physicist, and I don't want to open up a can of worms there. I recognise the limits of my expertise and want to steer clear of them.</p>\n<p>And I'm not posting any comments here. That's my offer: a detailed blog post critiquing the mathematics, with a link to it from here, or nothing.</p>",

The idea is that we have have a poorly trained category theorist and a good physicist, me, using chatgpt to learn about their work.  They get some feedback from the LLM and they cannot check it.  The feedback is category theory and physics.  The professional category theorist, that's you, is paid a fee to read the work and check the construction, the pure math, and if they are also a well trained physicist, they can comment on the physical theory.</p>\n<p>The analysis is put into a document and pasted here.  I try to absorb the analysis and then give a comment or an updated document.  No back and forth.  Just two blocks of work.  You set a reasonable price.  I will want to take all the analysis and put it wherever I want, math overflow, a web page, a full document that is posted to research gate etc.</p>\n<p>.....</p>\n<p>Well, look, think about it everyone.  This is going to become an increasing part of research and I am happy being the guinea pig.  I think it would be fascinating for anyone to try this with me.
