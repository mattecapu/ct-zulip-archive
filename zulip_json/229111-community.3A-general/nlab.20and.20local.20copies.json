It would be great to be able to do the same for nlab, but it doesn't seem to be so easy because nlab appears to have some bandwith restrictions. I've read on the nforum that there are people keeping a local copy of nlab databases. I would like to know:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If these local copies are accessible</li>\n<li>What is the way to get them</li>\n<li>If someone tried to reconstruct the nlab database as html pages locally.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The main reason why I ask is that having offline copies of wiki and nlab would make it  easier to work, say, when you are on a plane. As such I think there would be great value in mantaining a full, publically downloadable copy of the nlab. Any suggestions about this?</p>",
