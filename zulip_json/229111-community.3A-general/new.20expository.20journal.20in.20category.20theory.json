This is a separate series from the standard journal, with a specific focus on expository articles in the theory and applications of categories.  The editorial policy of the new series states:</p>\n<p>\"Expositions in Theory and Applications of Categories ('TAC Expositions') is a special series specifically designed for publication of well-written and novel expository articles on topics of current research interest in the theory and/or applications of categories.  While a TAC Exposition article need not include new results, it must be novel in either its arrangement or viewpoint, providing a new perspective or context for known results.  Authors considering submitting an expository paper are advised to consult an editor on its suitability for TAC Expositions.\"</p>\n<p>For more information, see <a href=\"http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/expositions/index.html\">http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/expositions/index.html</a>.</p>\n<p>We look forward to receiving your contributions for this new series!</p>\n<p>All the best,<br>\nGeoff Cruttwell<br>\nTAC Managing Editor</p>\n</blockquote>",
