I often find that following arguments in category theory requires juggling a lot of different contexts in your head. e.g., switching between seeing functors as mappings between categories, or as morphisms in cat, or as objects in a functor category. What would be really cool would be to be able to visualize all three of these interpretations simultaneously, and have interactive graphical highlighting that crosses the different views. So for example, if you mouse over an arrow in a diagram in cat, it highlights the corresponding dot in the functor category. </p>\n<p>I think this sort of thing would be incredibly helpful for pedagogy, and possibly also for research (although I can't really speak to that).</p>",

Applying category theory \"strictly\" is often not possible for many devs, either because it is too time consuming or because the needed theory is not there yet.

So, one of the most insightful examples of \"categorical thinking\" for me is distinguishing betweem modularity and compositionality. I wrote about it <a href=\"https://blog.statebox.org/modularity-vs-compositionality-a-history-of-misunderstandings-be0150033568\">here</a>. Many devs think modularly, meaning that they design their systems as \"modules\" that interface with each other. Still, not many devs think about which properties of the modules are preserved when they are combined. For instance, if the communication interface between two software components exposes too much or too little of the components features, you could get emerging behavior, meaning that the components do not interact as you expect. A very infamous example of this is worpress plugins: You load a bunch of them and it's almost guaranteed that your blog will explode. This is mainly due to miscommunication problems, or to different modules accessing  the same global variables at the same time etc.<br>\nOpposed to this, compositional thinking is about designing how modules are supposed to communicate by focusing on which properties should be preserved by the composition. You may call it \"clever API design\" if you prefer, but the idea is writing a suitable communication protocol between your components so that emerging behavior is minimized as much as possible. Compositional thinking is quintessentially category-theoretic, while modular thinking is not. <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span></p>",

        "content": "<p>You do not need to know category theory to think compositionally. Still, it helps a big deal, especially when the communication follows a non-obvious pattern. One of the most powerful features that categorical thinking gives you is the capacity of thinking in terms of universal properties. You may think about universal properties as a way to canonically build some information from the ingredients you have, so that some constraints are guaranteed. Some universal properties are well-known: For instance, if you have a mode of communication that behaves like a logical or on your input (if your input is A then to this, otherwise do that), it may make sense to phrase this using coproducts. Again, knowing what all those things formally means gives you quite a bunch of tools in your skillset. They are not just useful to prove theorems, you can also apply them \"informally\" in your working practice. <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span></p>",

        "content": "<p>A beautiful example of this, by the way, is optics. Optics in functional programming are bimodular data accessors, that is, ways to interact with data in both directions (e.g. read and write). If I want to read something that is inside something else, or write something that is inside something else, I need to compose those things. Obviously I don't want the composition to explode in my face, I actually want it to give me the right notion of read/write for a nested kind of data.<br>\nOptics, and in particular lenses, have been created in functional programming first, and have been proved useful since the beginning, because they are really well-behaved. Not surprisingly, category theorists did a lot of work on this, generalized things further, and in the end proved how optics satisfy a universal property, expressed using a thing called end/coend calculus. This is relevant. The reason why optics are so well behaved is because they are ineed canonical, even if proving this came some time after the definition was given and libraries were implemented. <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span></p>",

The innovations of HoTT and cubical TT are one contribution towards that goal, giving a better-behaved way of identifying the \"propositions\" while still keeping the computational content.  Then one needs a way to decide which propositions can be ignored on extraction.  For instance, Agda has a notion of \"irrelevant argument\" that I don't understand completely, but it's different from Coq's Prop and may have advantages in this regard.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>yes, I can understand that the goal is a better-behaved way of identifying the \"propositions\" while still keeping the computational content. and sure \"one needs a way to decide which propositions can be ignored on extraction.\"  <br>\nSo Many Thanks <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"276777\">@Mike Shulman</span>  for making the argument go back to something I can understand. <br>\nthis is much clearer. </p>\n<p>But what I still want to hear is how this impinges on the categorical models that are at issue. Because the gap between implementations and syntactic descriptions is huge, right? even for the most studied system, simply typed lambda-calculus,  the gap is still huge. and attempts along the lines of the Categorical Abstract Machine seem to have fallen in disuse. so it's fine to say we have this nice system MLTT/CIC/whatever that we want to implement and our mathematics of it work better for X, but our implementations work better for Y and hence we're trying Z, etc. this is level of description that I was hoping for and thanks <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"284213\">@dan pittman</span>  for a stab at that.</p>",

This machine was a central component of the first compiler for the CAML programming language, which would later become OCaml. “The change in perspective was quite striking: it turned out that the highly abstract structures used for interpreting λ-calculus were a ‘low-level’ language, meaning that it was close to a machine language, and interpretation became compilation”, comments the researcher.\"</p>",
