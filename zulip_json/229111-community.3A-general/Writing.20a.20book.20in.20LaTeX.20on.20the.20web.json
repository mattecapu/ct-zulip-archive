We’re using it a lot at Topos recently and it has a lot of great features including exporting to the Web by default and to ordinary LaTeX in a mostly automatic way, plus very flexible linking capabilities for writing in a modular way. I suspect it’s still “alpha” enough that John wouldn’t like it but I don’t think there’s anything clearly better yet.</p>",
