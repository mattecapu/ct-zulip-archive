We’re using it a lot at Topos recently and it has a lot of great features including exporting to the Web by default and to ordinary LaTeX in a mostly automatic way, plus very flexible linking capabilities for writing in a modular way. I suspect it’s still “alpha” enough that John wouldn’t like it but I don’t think there’s anything clearly better yet.</p>",

(But if I'm wrong, someone please correct me.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I've started experimenting with PreTeXt, and it's actually fairly nice.  The mathematics is straight-up LaTeX.  The XML is only used for document structure such as sectioning, blocks, and lists; this is where LaTeX tends to use <code>begin</code>/<code>end</code> environments anyway, so the verbosity of XML is not that much greater, and appropriate editor tooling can automatically insert the ending tags for you.</p>\n<p>The PreTeXt schema introduces a bit more verbosity, e.g. a theorem requires a <code>&lt;theorem&gt;</code> tag containing a <code>&lt;statement&gt;</code> tag containing a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag before you can start stating the theorem,  but that should also be automatable with a good editor (Emacs doesn't yet have such automation, as far as I can see, but I might do something about that if I continue using PreTeXt).  And the reason for that verbosity is logical, since a <code>&lt;theorem&gt;</code> tag can also contain a <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> and a <code>&lt;proof&gt;</code>, which are then associated to the theorem by the XML structure and can be easily programmatically manipulated.</p>\n<p>The XML-based design essentially <em>forces</em> you to separate semantics from presentation.  There is no way to say within the schema \"make this text 15 points tall and italics\", only \"here begins a section with this title\".  So it's not a replacement for (La)TeX as an engine for layout of printable documents.  But all those things you can do with TeX are exactly the things that make it so hard to compile to other formats like HTML, so this is arguably a good thing.</p>\n<p>PreTeXt produces HTML output that I think looks overall excellent, especially for textbooks (here are a <a href=\"https://activecalculus.org/single2e/frontmatter.html\">couple</a> <a href=\"https://complexanalysis.org/web/root-1-2-2.html\">examples</a>), and the available semantic information can at least in principle improve accessibility to screen readers and so on.  (And the PreTeXt people are thinking hard about this sort of thing -- for instance, you are instructed to put ending punctuation <em>outside</em> a display-math environment, because it is <em>semantically</em> not part of the mathematics and thus should be treated differently by non-visual output formats; but in visual output formats like PDF and HTML such punctuation is automatically moved to the end of the displayed mathematics, where it looks good, rather than at the beginning of the following line.)  It can also be compiled to PDF by way of LaTeX, so the output looks like LaTeX since it is, and also to epub and kindle formats.</p>\n<p>Personally, I prefer the \"linear\" presentation of a PreTeXt HTML document to the forester/stacks \"atomized\" approach, especially for something like a book that is \"projected on a totally ordered way on the page axis\" in the words of Serge Lang.  For authoring purposes, you're free to split up your source code into multiple files as finely as you like to facilitate reorganization, using <code>&lt;xi:include&gt;</code> tags to stitch it together.  Of course YMMV, but at the moment I'm happy enough with PreTeXt, compared to the alternatives I've seen, that I'm about to embark on a significant project using it.</p>",
