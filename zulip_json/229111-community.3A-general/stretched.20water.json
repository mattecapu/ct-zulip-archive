Finding out where and when phase lines merge and split is especially exciting. Could it be that the liquid region of the phase diagram for what is completely closed, so that at ridiculously high temperatures and pressures we find a new sublimation transition!? That's the kind of thought I couldn't have had without seeing a diagram like this.</p>",
