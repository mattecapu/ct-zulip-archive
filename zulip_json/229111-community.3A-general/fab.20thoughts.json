However, as <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"275899\">@Christian Williams</span> said, that’s not necessarily conducive to actual discussions about, well, math content. If people other than myself also see the appeal of having spaces to chat, though, perhaps we could have a convention where those topics would be followed by “(chat)”, and all other streams would be assumed to be as <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"275899\">@Christian Williams</span> described.</li>\n<li>Emoji reactions provide useful features by showing public perception without joining the fray; maybe we could take advantage of that by having conventions here that “bystanders” to indicate when they think discussions are getting either too heated, or off topic, or anything else server-y (perhaps with different emojis for different meanings). For example, someone could react with 🌨 or ❄️ to messages like those at the tail end of the argument above, and this would indicate to the participants of the discussion that perhaps they should step back and “chill out”. Idk if mods can search by recent emoji reaction, but if they can, it could also help mods identify potential places where they should step in if things progress. So, point is: designating specific conventions of meaning (and thereby function) for emoji reactions in the CoC or somewhere might help the public collectively “self-moderate” to an extent.</li>\n</ul>",
