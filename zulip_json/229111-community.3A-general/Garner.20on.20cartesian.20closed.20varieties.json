All commutative theories (or monads) induce monoidal closed categories. That is where Linton started off with the notion of <em>autonomous</em> categories. Kock I think proved that a theory is commutative iff the variety is monoidal closed. So the question boils down to when the tensor coincides with the cartesian product. For that it is necessary that the free algebra over 1 generator is 1. (funny enough, that came up in an unrelated conversation here yesterday.) Which means that there must be no constants, and there any unary operation must be affine. I am not sure, but I think Kock proved that that is sufficient... </p>\n<p>I hope I am not completely missing it. Maybe Garner is talking about those higher categories, I guess cartesian closed <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">∞</mi><mo separator=\"true\">,</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">(\\infty,1)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mopen\">(</span><span class=\"mord\">∞</span><span class=\"mpunct\">,</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.16666666666666666em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">1</span><span class=\"mclose\">)</span></span></span></span>-categories?
