I certainly did not, I assumed that all was well and everything was backed up somewhere. I just would need to google where, if need be! So I was looking for that discussion we had at the beginning of the year.</p>",

Can you confirm?</p>\n<p>But we know this is not enough and the main hurdle seems to be what @RobertFurber was discussing in the last message of the old thread:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think someone who knows how to program in Emacs Lisp could download a full copy, but I think it's illegal by the letter of the law (unless you asked each and every poster individually for their copyright). So it would have to \"fall off a lorry/truck\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Does this seem a fair summary? </p>\n<p>It seems to me odd that gmane could have it all up online for so many years and it's  still officially not allowed? <br>\nare the laws different in the EU? Does anyone know a lawyer we could ask these questions? <br>\ncos' of course we can try to  have tarballs uploaded to libgen, but it then fails the main purpose of being accessible mathematical information, right?</p>\n<p>I think the previous thread wound up in nice discussions about distributed systems etc, but the problem at hand has not been solved, except that Simon has a copy of the reader running. I'd appreciate been told that I am being dense and that we now have solved the problem of not losing the last 11 years of discussions in the category mailing list, if this is so. in this case we should tell the members of the category mailing list what's the problem and what's the solution. Failing this, we should at least let them know about the problem!</p>",

I was under the misapprehension before that this was a huge amount of data, but it is not that big and definitely not beyond what GitHub can deal with.
