Worth an inquiry. See <a href=\"https://zulipchat.com/plans/\" title=\"https://zulipchat.com/plans/\">their plans page</a>, which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Zulip Cloud Standard is free for open source projects. We also offer steep discounts (usually 85%-100%) to many non-profits, educational institutions, groups of friends, and in other scenarios where most of the users are not fulltime employees of the customer. Generally, only closed organizations that also pay their members’ salaries pay full price. Just contact <a href=\"mailto:sales@zulipchat.com\" title=\"mailto:sales@zulipchat.com\">sales@zulipchat.com</a> and we’d be happy to discuss your situation!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> (I should have put this in <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"229122\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/229122-meta\">#meta</a>; hopefully it'll be movable <a href=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/13912\" title=\"https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/13912\">soon</a>.)</p>",
