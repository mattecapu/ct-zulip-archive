Lewis' book counterfactuals was the one I first read.(<a href=\"http://www.andrewmbailey.com/dkl/\" title=\"http://www.andrewmbailey.com/dkl/\">collection of papers online</a>). He there analyses \"If Kangaroos had no tails, they would topple over\" as If In the closest world (to the actual world) where kangaroos have no tails they do topple over\" then the sentence is true. For this he adds to normal modal logic a closeness relation (also a system of spheres that collect equally close worlds). This is very useful to analyze knowledge in a way that allows one to take account of epistemic black holes (the brain-in-a-vat example, in older days dreaming). But it also gives a very interesting analysis of causality, though that has been <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/causation-and-counterfactuals\" title=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/causation-and-counterfactuals\">very much debated</a> since then, and was clearly an inspiration to Judea Pearl's work.  He also uses the  same distance relation in Counterfactuals to give an interesting analysis of deontic logic, and one for denoting. <br>\n It is not difficult to understand counterfactuals if one maps things out on a paper. <br>\nBut it would be good to find a category theoretic explanation of it.</p>",

I was reading that a 1½ years ago, when I knew a lot less. I need to get back to it. I think it looks mostly at the counterpart relation problem between them, but does not investigate Lewis' counterfactual relation based on adding a distance (similarity) relation to possible worlds.

It also explains how David Lewis would have moved from his 1969 thesis <a href=\"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Convention%3A-A-Philosophical-Study-Lewis/797bca436ce6948a4f35858e2022af25c872f9de\">Convention</a> supervised by W.V.O. Quine to his later work on counterfactuals, 4 years later. In Convention Lewis gives a game theoretical grounding of Convention. The first few pages of examples make the thinking very clear. One has to be a bit patient to get over his analysis of convention in signaling, to the last part of the book where he ties this in to Convention in a full Language.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Yeah, you've basically got ordinary logic with these two extra connectives (see note below).</p>\n<p>1) The box connective is described above. Reiterating though it basically reads: \"if it were the case that \\phi, then it would be the case that \\psi\".<br>\nFor instance \"if the bullet had struck the heart, the patient would have died\".</p>\n<p>2) The diamond connective is written the same except with a diamond instead of a box. It reads: \"if it were the case that \\phi, then it might be the case that \\psi\"<br>\nFor instance: \"If the the bullet had struck the lungs, the patient might've died\".</p>\n<p>Sphere models give us a way of formalizing which worlds are closer or further than others to our own. Formally this is done by talking about nested sets of worlds. Some remarks about this are that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lewis gives a short list of examples where one can talk about other types of logics by adding extra restrictions to the model. I don't remember these off the top of my head but one example involved being able to talk about an unreachable idealized world to deal with morality.</li>\n<li>When creating a model it's not necessarily obvious how far away (i.e. in which sphere) a given world should be, this is part of why Judea Pearl takes a different approach to counterfactual reasoning using causal networks. Arguably his approach is more popular these days.</li>\n<li>You don't actually get a metric on worlds. All you have is a notion of \"how far away is a given world from our own world\". Intuitively two worlds that are equally far from our own could also be far from each other. Also, getting from our world to another might be easier than getting back. For this reason you can't give worlds a metric topology (at least not in the usual way, my research involves this) and do other things you might at first expect to be able to do when seeing that picture of spheres.</li>\n<li>There are applications to machine learning interpretability where you think of sample inputs as your worlds. Like for a convolutional network that detects cats. You might take a picture containing a cat as your input representing \"our world\". Then you might perturb that picture slightly to obtain a slightly altered picture representing a nearby \"world\". By feeding the network several pictures you can create a map of worlds where a cat is detected. In other words you can figure out which features of the original picture are causing the network to detect a cat. I'm sorry if this explanation is not very good, the application is kind of in reverse and isn't super well known.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note: Lewis actually develops a lot of different connectives and modalities in his book to do variations of the same thing but ultimately they're all equivalent to these two connectives</p>",
