In particular, we argue that (3+1)d fermionic topological order with G-symmetry correspond to  SuperVect-enriched  G-crossed braided fusion 2-categories. We then show that the categorical data necessary to define these theories agrees with that arising from a fermionic generalization of the Wang-Wen-Witten construction of bosonic topological theories with G-symmetry saturating an anomaly.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>José Garre-Rubio, András Molnár and Germán Sierra, Two-Dimensional Bialgebras and Quantum Groups: Algebraic Structures and Tensor Network Realizations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We introduce a framework to define coalgebra and bialgebra structures on two-dimensional (2D) square lattices, extending the algebraic theory of Hopf algebras and quantum groups beyond the one-dimensional (1D) setting. Our construction is based on defining 2D coproducts through horizontal and vertical maps that satisfy compatibility and associativity conditions, enabling the consistent growth of vector spaces over lattice sites. We present several examples of 2D bialgebras, including group-like and Lie algebra-inspired constructions and a quasi-1D coproduct instance that is applicable to Taft-Hopf algebras and to quantum groups.  [...] Our results establish a local and algebraically consistent method to embed quantum group symmetries into higher-dimensional lattice systems, potentially connecting to the emerging theory of fusion 2-categories and categorical symmetries in quantum many-body physics. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Daniel Teixeira and Matthew Yu, Mutual Influence of Symmetries and Topological Field Theories</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We study how the fusion 2-category symmetry of a fermionic (2+1)d QFT can be affected when one allows for stacking with TQFTs to be an equivalence relation for QFTs.
