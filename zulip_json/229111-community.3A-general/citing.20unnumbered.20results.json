        "content": "<p>With no pretension to scholarship (i.e., I don't actually care enough to go through the Katz et al. paper with a fine-toothed comb), I think it is fair to wonder whether ideology or partisanship is at work in that paper. It just strikes me as a tad heavy-handed. </p>\n<p>Halmos did have strong opinions (as many people do), and he is quite candid about them in his automathography. One message that came through is that he found logic texts, at least those in the 50's, as obfuscatory and hiding the essential points. For example, at one point he had an epiphany that propositional logic was all about free Boolean algebras, something he never got from the texts, and this insight struck him so forcefully that he wanted to similarly algebraize all of logic. I am somewhat sympathetic. Lawvere would do something similar in his thesis, blurring the lines between syntax and semantics in universal algebra (the theory is a free model). Lawvere would, still later, \"algebraize\" predicate logic and its extensions (hyperdoctrines, etc.), and did it a whole lot better than Halmos, but I think I can see similar impulses at work. </p>\n<p>I don't know that Halmos behaved at all dishonorably, or acted like a bully, etc. Clearly the problem settled by Robinson and Bernstein was of great personal interest to him and he wanted to understand what they had done on his own terms and in his accustomed language. (Maybe he <em>was</em> a bully? I'm not sure.) </p>\n<p>Yes, he does make some disparaging remarks about category theory, but I imagine this had something to do with the natural aging process. :-) </p>\n<p>Aside: I wrote Halmos once. In his automathography, he boasts about the wonderful course on topological groups that he taught at Chicago, and about his wonderful take-home exam (\"Geniuses are expected to solve all fifteen\").  I liked one of the problems -- does there exist a nontrivial connected Hausdorff topological group of exponent 2? -- and built a little category theory talk around it. Later I wrote to him with my solution. He responded approximately thus: \"Your solution is in the language of category theory, and your language frightens me. My own solution was in the language of measure theory and went like this...\".</p>",

So at least this does give one pause. (Not that Halmos was sympathetic to Bishop's constructivism -- he portrayed it as a kind of religious thing -- but let it be noted that Bishop was a Halmos student, in the area of functional analysis.)</p>",
