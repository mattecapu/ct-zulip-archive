When Woodin discusses truth, he sees himself as making predictions about the physical world, including his infamous</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the next 10,000 years there will be no discovery of an inconsistency in [ZFC + \"There exist infinitely many Woodin cardinals\"]. [1]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He justifies the notion of truth for abstract mathematical axioms by the usefulness and the truth of the physical predictions they make, in line with the following opinion of Gödel:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There might exist axioms so abundant in their verifiable consequences, shedding so much light upon a whole discipline, and furnishing such powerful methods for solving given problems (and even solving them, as far as possible, in a constructivistic way) that quite irrespective of their intrinsic necessity they would have to be assumed at least in the same sense as any established physical theory. [2]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This view falls under realism and logical anti-exceptionalism. Woodin considers certain axioms true, and compares the truth of competing axioms, by the way they clarify the discipline, their use in problem-solving, and the degree to which their physical predictions hold up.</p>\n<p>You ask: \"Validate the axioms! What could that mean, I wonder?\" I think he refers to projective determinacy meeting Gödel's and Woodin's criteria.</p>\n<p>NB. I don't find this a <em>convincing argument</em>, and don't expect others would either. I am just trying to summarize Woodin's beliefs. I can't be impartial; to be honest, whenever I read about Woodin and his supposedly-impressive track record of physical predictions, the Nostradamus keyword in Girard's glossary [3] comes to mind:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Abduction has made a lot of progress in recent years; for instance in 1937, a Mr. Ruir was able to predict the Spanish Civil War by an abductive reading of Nostradamus. Now, with computer-aided abduction, it has been possible, in 1998, to read back the death of Princess Diana in the verses of Nostradamus... unfortunately, after the accident took place.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>[1] H.

I'll quote a bit:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It all started out as a joke. Argument for argument's sake. Alison and her infuriating heresies.</p>\n<p>\"A mathematical theorem,\" she'd proclaimed, \"only becomes true when a physical system tests it out: when the system's behaviour depends in some way on the theorem being <em>true</em> or <em>false</em>.</p>\n<p>It was June 1994. We were sitting in a small paved courtyard, having just emerged from the final lecture in a one-semester course on the philosophy of mathematics - a bit of light relief from the hard grind of the real stuff. We had fifteen minutes to to kill before meeting some friends for lunch. It was a social conversation - verging on mild flirtation - nothing more. Maybe there were demented academics, lurking in dark crypts somewhere, who held views on the nature of mathematical truth which they were willing to die for. But were were twenty years old, and we <em>knew</em> it was all angels on the head of a pin.</p>\n<p>I said, \"Physical systems don't create mathematics. Nothing <em>creates</em> mathematics - it's timeless. All of number theory would still be exactly the same, even if the universe contained nothing but a single electron.\"</p>\n<p>Alison snorted. \"Yes, because even <em>one electron</em>, plus a space-time to put it in, needs all of quantum mechanics and all of general relativity - and all the mathematical infrastructure they entail. One particle floating in a quantum vacuum needs half the major results of group theory, functional analysis, differential geometry - \"</p>\n<p>\"OK, OK! I get the point. But if that's the case... the events in the first picosecond after the Big Bang would have 'constructed' every last mathematical truth required by <em>any</em> physical system, all the way to the Big Cruch. Once you've got the mathematics which underpins the Theory of Everything... that's it, that's all you ever need. End of story.\"</p>\n<p>\"But it's not. To <em>apply</em> the Theory of Everything to a particular system, you still need all the mathematics for dealing with <em>that system</em> - which could include results far beyond the mathematics the TOE itself requires. I mean, fifteen billion years after the Big Bang, someone can still come along and prove, say... Fermat's Last Theorem.\" Andrew Wiles at Princeton had recently announced a proof of the famous conjecture, although his work was still being scrutinised by his colleagues, and the final verdict wasn't yet in. \"Physics never needed <em>that</em> before.\"</p>\n<p>I protested, \"What do you mean, 'before'? Fermat's Last Theorem never has - and never will - have anything to do with any branch of physics.\"</p>\n<p>Alison smiled sneakily. \"No <em>branch</em>, no. But only because the class of physical systems whose behaviour depend on it is so ludicrously specific: the brains of mathematicians who are trying to validate the Wiles proof.\"</p>\n<p>\"Think about it. Once you start trying to prove a theorem, then even if the mathematics is so 'pure' that it has no relevance to any other object in the universe... you've just made it relevant to <em>yourself</em>. You have to choose <em>some</em> physical process to test the theorem - whether you use a computer, or a pen and paper... or just close your eyes and shuffle <em>neurotransmitters</em>. There's no such thing as a proof which doesn't rely on physical events, and whether they're inside or outside your skull doesn't make them any less real.\"</p>\n</blockquote>",

As for me, I follow Elvis Costello on this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I used to be disgusted<br>\nNow I'm just amused</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I believe Woodin thinks you can get to understand mathematical structures and figure out what axioms they obey by a slow process of discovery.   For example, at 12:59 his slides say</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Claim:</strong> Projective determinacy is the correct axiom for second order number theory just as the classical Peano axioms are the correct axioms for number theory.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This claim is sloppy in a number of ways, even given his philosophy where axioms can be \"correct\".   What does he mean by \"the\" correct axiom - aren't there others?    By \"classical Peano axioms\" does he mean the first-order axiom system PA?  Peano's original axioms were second-order.   </p>\n<p>Anyway, he seems to believe the process of discovering \"correct\" axioms is a search for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consilience\">consilience</a> (though he doesn't use that word): when you've got enough good theorems it's evidence that your axioms are correct.  But I don't think he's enough of a philosopher to state his philosophy in a clear way.</p>",

On one hand the drawing has some extraneous physical properties that ideal abstract squares of geometry don't have, like color. On the other hand (and more importantly) it fails to have some key properties that an ideal mathematical square would have, such as 4 sides of exactly equal length.</p>\n<p>Whereas, say, a sequent proof tree printed in a book sure has some extraneous properties, but I don't see any property it <em>lacks</em> that I'd expect the abstract, ideal proof object to have. One could argue that in some sense, the printed tree is a proof, or that it at least contains a proof. This point-of-view gets messy (what about a circular proof printed on the surface of a cylinder), but having thought a lot about the philosophy of logic, it's still not clear to me that there's no way to make it work. So perhaps, if Woodin wanted to, he could justify the claim that predictions about consistency have a certain physical import that predictions about geometry simply don't have.</p>",
