But he did manage to prove that the square root of 22/7 is irrational!</p>\n<p>Now, this is better than it sounds, because I believe the old Greek proof that <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msqrt><mn>2</mn></msqrt></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\sqrt{2}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1.04em;vertical-align:-0.1328em;\"></span><span class=\"mord sqrt\"><span class=\"vlist-t vlist-t2\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.9072em;\"><span class=\"svg-align\" style=\"top:-3em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:3em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\" style=\"padding-left:0.833em;\"><span class=\"mord\">2</span></span></span><span style=\"top:-2.8672em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:3em;\"></span><span class=\"hide-tail\" style=\"min-width:0.853em;height:1.08em;\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"400em\" height=\"1.08em\" viewBox=\"0 0 400000 1080\" preserveAspectRatio=\"xMinYMin slice\"><path d=\"M95,702\nc-2.7,0,-7.17,-2.7,-13.5,-8c-5.8,-5.3,-9.5,-10,-9.5,-14\nc0,-2,0.3,-3.3,1,-4c1.3,-2.7,23.83,-20.7,67.5,-54\nc44.2,-33.3,65.8,-50.3,66.5,-51c1.3,-1.3,3,-2,5,-2c4.7,0,8.7,3.3,12,10\ns173,378,173,378c0.7,0,35.3,-71,104,-213c68.7,-142,137.5,-285,206.5,-429\nc69,-144,104.5,-217.7,106.5,-221\nl0 -0\nc5.3,-9.3,12,-14,20,-14\nH400000v40H845.2724\ns-225.272,467,-225.272,467s-235,486,-235,486c-2.7,4.7,-9,7,-19,7\nc-6,0,-10,-1,-12,-3s-194,-422,-194,-422s-65,47,-65,47z\nM834 80h400000v40h-400000z\"/></svg></span></span></span><span class=\"vlist-s\">​</span></span><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.1328em;\"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> is irrational had been lost in western Europe at this time.

(It's long, but folks can skip it if they don't care.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>That's where Ardoline and Lenzo's work comes in. They both document the ways in which we turn these online services into cognitive prostheses, and then investigate how the enshittification of these services ends up making us stupider, by taking away the stuff that helps us think. They're drawing a line between platform decay and cognitive decay.</p>\n<p>The authors look at examples like the enshittification of Google Search, a product that Google has deliberately and irretrievably enshittified:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2024/04/24/naming-names/#prabhakar-raghavan\">https://pluralistic.net/2024/04/24/naming-names/#prabhakar-raghavan</a></p>\n<p>The web is a giant cognitive prosthesis, and early web tools put a lot of emphasis on things like bookmark management and local caching, so that the knowledge and cognition you externalized to the web were under your control. But Google Search was so goddamned magic – before they cynically destroyed it – that a lot of us switched from \"not remembering things because you have a bookmark that takes you to a website that remembers it for you\" to \"not remembering things and not remembering where to find them, and just typing queries into Google.\" The collapse of Google into a giant pile of shit is like giving every web user a traumatic brain injury.</p>\n<p>It's a good paper, but I think the situation is actually more dire than the paper makes it out to be, thanks to the AI bubble –</p>\n<p>Wait! I'm not actually going to talk about what AI can do (which is a combination of a small set of boring useful things, a bunch of novelties, and a long list of things that AI can't do but is being used to do anyway). I'm talking about the financial fraud that AI serves.</p>\n<p>Tech companies <em>must</em> be perceived as growing, because when a company is growing, it is valued <em>far</em> more highly than a company is once it has \"matured.\" This is called the \"price to earnings ratio\" – the number of dollars investors are willing to pay for the company compared to the number of dollars a company is bringing in. So long as a company is growing, the PE ratio is very high, and this helps the company to <em>actually</em> grow. That's because the shares in growing companies are highly liquid, and can be traded for equity in other companies and/or the labor of key employees, meaning that growth companies can almost always outbid their mature counterparts when it comes to expanding through acquisition and hiring. That means that while a company is growing, its PE ratio can help it <em>keep</em> growing.</p>\n<p>But here's the corollary: when a growth company <em>stops</em> growing, its shares are suddenly and violently revalued as though they were shares in a mature company, which tanks the personal net worth of the company's top managers and key employees (whose portfolios are stuffed with their employer's now-plummeting stock). Worse: in order to retain those employees and hire more (or to acquire key companies), the no-longer-growing company has to pay with cash, which is <em>much</em> harder to get than its own shares. Even worse: they have to bid against <em>growing</em> companies.</p>\n<p>A growth company is like an airplane that has two modes: climbing and nose-diving, and while it's easy to go from climbing to crashing, it's <em>much</em> harder to go the other way. Ironically, the moment at which a company's growth is most likely to stall is right after its greatest triumph: after a company conquers its market, it has nowhere else to go. Google's got a 90% Search market-share – how can it possibly grow Search?</p>\n<p>It can't (just like Meta can't really grow social, and Microsoft can't grow office suites, etc), so it has to convince Wall Street that it has a shot at conquering some <em>other</em> market that the street perceives as unimaginably vast and thus capable of keeping the growth engine going. Tech has pulled a lot of sweaty tricks to create this impression, inflating bubbles like \"pivot to video\" and \"metaverse\" and \"cryptocurrency,\" and now it's AI.</p>\n<p>The problem is that AI just isn't very popular. People go out of their way to avoid AI products:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19368623.2024.2368040\">https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19368623.2024.2368040</a></p>\n<p>For an AI-driven growth story to work, tech companies have to produce a stream of charts depicting lines that go up and to the right, reflecting some carefully chosen set of metrics demonstrating AI's increasing popularity. One way to produce these increasing trend-lines on demand is to replace all the most commonly used parts of a service that you love and rely on with buttons that summon an AI. This is the \"fatfinger AI economy,\" a set of trendlines produced by bombarding people who graze their screens with a stray fingertip with a bunch of AI bullshit, so you can claim that your users are \"engaging\" with AI:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/02/kpis-off/#principal-agentic-ai-problem\">https://pluralistic.net/2025/05/02/kpis-off/#principal-agentic-ai-problem</a></p>\n<p>It's a form of \"twiddling\" – changing how a service works on a per-user, per-interaction basis in order to shift value from the user to the company:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/19/twiddler/\">https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/19/twiddler/</a></p>\n<p>Twiddling represents <em>the</em> big cognitive hazard from enshittification during the AI bubble: the parts of your UI that matter most to you are the parts that you use as vital cognitive prostheses. A product team whose KPI is \"get users to tap on an AI button\" is going to use the fine-grained data they have on your technological activities to preferentially target these UI elements that you rely on with AI boobytraps. You are too happy, so they are leaving money on the table, and they're coming for it.</p>\n<p>This is a form of \"attention rent\": the companies are taxing your muscle-memory, forcing you to produce deceptive usage statistics at the price of either diverting your cognition from completing a task to hunt around for the button that banishes the AI and lets you get back to what you were doing; or to simply abandon that cognitive prosthesis:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/03/subprime-attention-rent-crisis/#euthanize-rentiers\">https://pluralistic.net/2023/11/03/subprime-attention-rent-crisis/#euthanize-rentiers</a></p>\n<p>It's <em>true</em> \"engagement-hacking\": not performing acts of dopamine manipulation; but rather, spying on your habitual usage of a digital tool in order to swap buttons around in order to get you to make a number go up. It's exploiting the fact that you engage with something useful and good to make it less useful and worse, because if you're too happy, some enshittifier is leaving money on the table.</p>\n</blockquote>",

The bridging-based machine-learning algorithm requires ratings from both sides of the spectrum in order to publish notes, that can have the intended effect of decreasing interaction with such content.[35][36][37]</p>\n<p>Contributors are volunteers with access to an interface from which they have the ability to monitor tweets and replies that may be misleading.[21][9][38] Notes in need of ratings by contributors are located under a \"Needs your help\" section of the interface. Other contributors then give their opinion on the usefulness of the note, identifying notes as \"Helpful\" or \"Not Helpful\".[21][39] The contributor gets points if their note is validated,[40][21] known as \"Rating Impact\", that reflects how helpful a contributors' ratings have been.[39][41][42] X users are able to vote on whether they find notes helpful or not,[18] but must apply to become contributors in order to write notes, the latter being restricted by \"Rating Impact\" as well as the Community Notes guidelines.[39][41]</p>",

It wasn't, it seems, rogue academics endorsing crackpots with access to an LLM. </p>\n<p>The new standard is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Automatic endorsement for new submitters in all Math categories will now require both 1) an email address from an academic/research institution, and 2) previous authorship on an existing paper which has been accepted to the arXiv Mathematics section (see <a href=\"https://info.arxiv.org/help/authority.html\">paper ownership</a>). New submitters who cannot meet these requirements will no longer be automatically endorsed, but can still <a href=\"https://info.arxiv.org/help/endorsement.html#who-can-endorse\">obtain a personal endorsement</a> directly from an established arXiv author in the same research area.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Caveat for <code>math-ph</code>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This policy update only applies to arXiv Mathematics, and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/category_taxonomy\">all the Math categories contained in the section</a>. Please note, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/list/math-ph/recent\">Mathematical Physics</a> (math-ph) is a sub-section of Physics and will follow endorsement rules for Physics. Each category of arXiv has different moderators, who are subject matter experts with a terminal degree in their particular subject, to best serve the scholarly pursuits, goals, and standards of their category. While this policy update is currently only being implemented for the arXiv Mathematics section, other arXiv sections may wish to update their endorsement policies in the future.

Now I'm getting roughly 1 such request per day, almost all from people with completely wacky ideas.   But I don't think it's solely because of the new arXiv policy, first because of the timing and second because a lot of these people don't have academic affiliations and thus the policy doesn't apply to them.</p>\n<p>Many of these people don't even have the common sense to send me the paper that they are trying to put on the arXiv, so I can evaluate it!    But usually it's obvious that the paper would be bad, so I don't even answer most of these emails.  Here's a typical one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dear Professor Baez,</p>\n<p>I hope you are doing well. I am an independent researcher preparing my first arXiv submission to the quant-ph category and am writing to request possible endorsement.</p>\n<p>My manuscript, entitled “The Awareness Theory of Everything: A Recursive Observer-Primitive Framework for Spacetime and Quantum Phenomena,” presents a foundational, observer-primitive approach in which awareness is taken as the minimal starting point, from which spacetime, quantum phase, entanglement, and particle identity are derived via recursion.</p>\n<p>I understand endorsement does not imply agreement with the content, only that the work is appropriate for the category. I would be grateful if you would consider endorsing me, or let me know if further information would be helpful.</p>\n<p>Thank you very much for your time.</p>\n<p>(Please see below for endorsement links)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here's another:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dear Prof. Baez,</p>\n<p>I hope this email finds you well. My name is [---], an independent researcher in theoretical physics. I am writing to respectfully request your endorsement for submitting my preprint to arXiv in the math-ph category.</p>\n<p>The paper, titled \"Law of Absolute Kinematics: The Ultimate Equation of the Universe Driven by the α₀ Postulate,\" proposes a single kinematic postulate—that the proper four-acceleration modulus of all observers (with zero non-gravitational three-acceleration) is a universal constant α₀ &gt; 0. This forces spacetime to emerge as de Sitter space and three-dimensional hyperbolic space (H³), analytically determining all fundamental constants (G, ℏ, c, Λ) and unifying inertia, gravity, and quantum topology via worldline knots and Kähler geometry. A companion paper, \"Topological Generation of the Fermion Mass Spectrum: From Worldline Knots to Fundamental Particle Inertia,\" details how fermion masses arise from topological invariants in H³.</p>\n<p>Your work on knot theory, category theory in TQFT, and mathematical physics intersections (e.g., your writings on knots in quantum mechanics and higher categories) has been inspirational. My framework's knot algebra mapping fermions to 12 minimal-volume knots in H³, enforcing CPT invariance, aligns closely with your explorations of topological structures in physical paradigms.</p>\n<p>The preprint is openly available [....]</p>\n<p>I would be deeply grateful if you could review and endorse this submission, as your expertise in these areas makes you an ideal endorser. Please let me know if you need any additional information.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>\n<p>Best regards, </p>\n</blockquote>",

To filter these bad-faith submissions, the arXiv could implement a dynamic, LLM-moderated proof-of-knowledge oral examination that builds directly upon the remote proctoring infrastructure already normalized by the online Canadian citizenship test. Just as the Canadian government leverages webcam monitoring, identity verification, and strict time limits to secure a high-stakes remote exam, this academic protocol would escalate that exact technological precedent into a continuous audio-visual feed where the author's hands must remain explicitly visible to prevent unauthorized AI assistance.</p>\n<p>When an author attempts to upload a preprint, an efficient model would parse the paper's claimed domain to generate ten foundational, open-ended questions. For example, the system might ask the candidate to explain why the Kullback-Leibler divergence fails to be a true distance metric. Given a strict three-minute window per question, the author must verbally defend their conceptual reasoning directly to the camera. This setup substitutes the citizenship exam's static format and human fallback interviews with a dynamic, real-time challenge that automated generators cannot fake.</p>\n<p>Instead of relying on human moderators, a real-time LLM would transcribe the spoken answers and evaluate them against established academic consensus. Authors who successfully demonstrate their internalized domain knowledge by passing a fifty percent accuracy threshold would automatically receive cryptographic submission privileges to finalize their upload. This solution scales efficiently without adding human administrative overhead, neutralizing bad-faith submissions by targeting the core inability of automated tools to perform a real-time conceptual defense under pressure.
