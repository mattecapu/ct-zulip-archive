So <strong>what was the motivation to use \"category\" as the term</strong> for that central concept of category theory?</p>\n</blockquote>",

Now the discovery of ideas as general as these is chiefly the willingness to make a brash or speculative abstraction, in this case supported by the pleasure of purloining words from the philosophers: “Category” from Aristotle and Kant, “Functor” from Carnap (<em>Logische Syntax der Sprache</em>), and “natural transformation” from then current informal parlance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is from the notes at the end of Chapter I of Mac Lane's famous book <em>Categories for the Working Mathematician</em>.
