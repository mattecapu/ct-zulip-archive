This is obviously a rubbery figure, because of the overlap between higher category theory and homotopy theory, and then also things like algebraic/arithmetic geometry or K-theory. But I'm happy to consider people who publish a paper on category theory where the application comes second as \"doing category theory\". Argue it out in your answer.</p>\n<p>And the question was also raised about how many people do applied category theory. This one is perhaps even harder to outline, because of what counts as ACT. There's the whole nexus surrounding Spivak/Fong/Topos Inst. ultimately coming from John Baez, but this is obviously far too narrow. Looking at the <a href=\"https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2025/10/applied_category_theory_2026.html\">program committee for the recently-announced ACT</a> (and all the other people in that blog post, a few of the names surprised me. Is Tholen doing ACT? Pronk? Maria Manuel Clementino? Maybe some of the more senior people are pivoting, or perhaps they are there because a more interdisciplinary panel needs people not just at the interface, but also within the different specialities.</p>",

That gave an order of magnitude lower bound, but it's less easy to get an upper bound that's tight. There surely is less than ten thousand category theorists, and less than a thousand applied category theorists. But can anyone either give some kind of rigorous data-based estimate, or a good Fermi estimate argument?</p>",

        "content": "<p>I think the question is even more difficult to pin down than your characterization. People doing CT have been pushed into other fields for decades. Category theorists have been thinking about CS applications for a very long time. Obviously not everyone who writes in Haskell is an applied category theorist, but how far back from that do you have to pull to find the CTists? Clark Barwick <a href=\"https://notes.dzackgarza.com/attachments/BarwickFutureOfHomotopyTheory.pdf\">said</a> that homotopy theory is not a branch of topology, it is the enrichment of the notion of equality. Surely category theory could have had claim to this notion over \"homotopy\", a notion that originally did specifically refer to a topological phenomenon? If you consider algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, Lie theory, the question begins to look like a cousin to asking who does set theory and counting everyone. This I think is partially why so many people in these fields will insist, up to the point of insult and sometimes beyond, that category theory is _no more_ than a convenient language for doing math.</p>",

I guess there are less than 100 math professors on average per university.

By eye scanning, I see there are about 30 papers per issue, with about 2 authors per paper. I'd count that as 60 category theorists per issue. So, on a period of 20 years, there are less than 1200 authors at TAC. I would say that, someone who has been active in CT in the last 20 years should appear at least once.
