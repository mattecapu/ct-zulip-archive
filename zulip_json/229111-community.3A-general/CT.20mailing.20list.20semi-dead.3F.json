The mailing list was used to coordinate the activities of this community and is considered by everyone to be the official source of information -- and somewhat the metronome -- of conferences deadlines.</p>\n<p>The problem may be solved, hopefully soon, but the reliability of the list has been steadily decreasing in the last years. Wouldn't it be an idea to think of alternative ways to officially communicate our conferences and important dates (such as the HoTTEST seminars, or the ItaCa ones?) I was thinking of something like an editable wall on the nlab, maybe with an RSS option. This would also move the moderation duties to a more distributed approach, and hopefully speed up the process. </p>\n<p>What do people think? What should people do?</p>\n<p>I encourage people to resist taking any concrete action before any form of consensus is reached.</p>",

My impression was that it had been less active, but is still used for communication relating to announcements.

One being the Logic Colloquium announcement, the other being the ItaCa fest announcement. Today  I had informal confirmation that the mailinglist is not operating at the moment, but this is not at all the first time in the last two years that a message that I, or the ItaCa people, have sent does not get dispatched, or gets dispatched with enormous delay.</p>\n<p>Since some may have little experience with the problem, let me sum it up. As many mailinglists the categories one is moderated. This means that when I send something to it, there's someone that decides whether the message is good enough, or relevant enough, to be dispatched. A number of times the ItaCa seminar hasn't been announced, or was announced AFTER it had happened, because of this. I am sure you understand this is far from being tolerable. With the logic colloquium this time, the message simply never appeared, and the situation is getting less and less acceptable with the time.</p>\n<p>While I understand the importance of moderation, and I am sure this not voluntary censorship, it ends up being...  censorship.</p>",

(1) RS is not centered around us, nor there is a way to send a mail to a group of people that would like to receive one on the topic (I think). (2) Zulip is a lot of things, and I think could be an interesting solution, but it requires people to subscribe to it, and check it regularly.

I don't feel more excluded than I usually do. What I find disturbing is that the people in the know couldn't care less about the people that are less in the know and want to lend a hand to address a dysfunctional situation. On a sociological level this is completely understandable, it's a typical mistake of older/more influential members of a community to override the natural dialectics that follows from multiple opinions in the same room. It's the dual mistake to the one made by many young people, believing that they know how things work and wanting to make the world better with energy and enthusiasm. So, I understand that everything was done in perfectly good faith, or I am totally willing to give the benefit of the doubt. What worries me is that the general issue goes completely unnoticed or even worse, that I have to avoid being gaslighted with Keanu-Reeves-esque moves by sentences like \"no one would have raised a finger, if a small subgroup of the community didn't single-handedly decide to get in charge of things\". That's false, and reading it is offensive, to say the least. That's why I used the word ridicolous. It's absurd, untenable, and offensive.

        "content": "<p>For those not on the CT mailing list: let me pass along Ross Street's nice little prehistory of that mailing list:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dear Bob [Rosebrugh]:</p>\n<p>Far away in time and distance from most of your readers Max Kelly, in Australia, decided to make a mailing list of category theorists he knew from conferences; I contributed some more people. The list was typed on a golfball IBM typewriter. When we had a preprint or two (and once, a \"Christmas Letter''), we would photocopy the list onto sheets of address labels, put the preprints in envelopes, and mail them using the reliable postal system of the 1970s.</p>\n<p>Once we sent the list itself around too. Mike Barr wrote or said to Max: \"What am I supposed to do with this!'' Max explained what we did. However, by then, word processors were around and Mike wanted an electronic version. We moved to that. The first word processor our Macquarie Mathematics Department secretaries used was called \"OK editor'', not great. Of course then in came email and work stations and personal computers and TeX, . . . ; you know the story.</p>\n<p>In 1990, you stepped in with prescient creations: a social medium for category theory and one of the very first electronic mathematics journals. What a debt our subject owes you!! You dedicated so much to running both magnificently. So easy to say \"thank you'', and I do. However, with all the thanks flowing in, our joint appreciation should be clear.</p>\n<p>It is a hard act to follow. Luckily, JS has stepped forward and already managed to have a replacement system up and running. I have full confidence that he will run it well, he is so bright and energetic. Moreover, I told the little story in the first paragraph to express my feeling of some satisfaction that the system has come to this far, distant land.</p>\n<p>Surely now Bob, you will have a bit more time for research and other things. You deserve it.</p>\n<p>With best regards,<br>\nRoss   </p>\n</blockquote>",

So if one would hope to get most of the CT mailing list community here, there would need to be a prolonged campaign to send out invite links to the CT mailing list... which would turn into spam, so I would not support this kind of action.</p>\n<p>An alternative that I could get behind is a series of events that have coordinated with this zulip to have the web discussions taking place here.  The mailing list announcements for the CfP, etc. would mention that this is where the web discussions are held and include an active invite link, noting when the invite link expires and that a fresh invite link will accompany the next announcement for the event.</p>\n<p>That said, I don't think it is <em>necessarily</em> a bad thing that the CT zulip and the CT mailing list serve different subsets of the CT community; the relative merits and demerits of that (present) fact would be worth considering if any effort is to be expended on \"get 'em all over here\".</p>",
