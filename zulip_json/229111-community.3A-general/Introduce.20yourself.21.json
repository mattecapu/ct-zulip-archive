Another use might be in Topos Quantum Theory which is too bound to Kochen-Specker and the classical observation states. One might want something with stronger entanglement, using tensor products on Quantales. I'd like to have a Many World variant of (non)commutative Topos Quantum Theory.

I had the privilage of collaborating with great people such Deepak Kapur, Jose Meseguer, Cathy Meadows, Christophe Ringeissen and many others. Currently, I am a teaching faculty at UT Dallas and continue my reseach. Before Dallas, I was a postdoc in three countries: one year in Italy, 3 years in Germany and approx one year in Spain. My research topics are quite theoretical, though I haven't applied anything from category theory myself. I know that a few category theoretic treatments were developed for unification in the past.

I had a quick look at the problems you've pointed out in the application to Middle Egyptian, and I think they're quite interesting. CQM (or DisCoCat) is probably not the be-all and end-all of applying CT to linguistics. Sometimes studying the obstructions can be useful too! </p>\n<p>Since your thesis, there's been a lot of development in NLP.

Some people are working to fix that but I think learning should be central, way more than it is now.</li>\n<li>The functor from pregroups to whatever semantics doesn't really exist. The \"fix\" is to use the free CCC generated on a dictionary, but that defeats the purpose of the functor in the first place, at least conceptually. This is a huge problem but not enough people pay attention to it. It is also related to the above point: The functor should be backward, cos grammar should be learned, not imposed.</li>\n<li>No one seems to have a real clue of what the \"sentence space\" is.</li>\n<li>Other problems are nastier in nature, but the conceptually biggest ones for me are the three above.</li>\n</ul>",

On the other hand, grammar is no human invention, but a representation of stuff happening in the world out there.  <br>\nOn problem 3, this is now 100% settled as far as I am concerned, thanks to the evolving meanings in arXiv:1904.03478, with the meanings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>Seems encouraging. </li>\n<li>Indeed, the first paper, where instead of the functor you were using products, was much better imho. I am in a similar situation now with cryptography: A functor gives me too much relatedness, and doesn't work. A product gives me too little relatedness, and doesn't work. I think there are slick cartegorical ways to really depict what's going on there, but in the end what you wanna do is just drawing wires between things, and that's easier to implement than to formalize mathematically (!!!).</li>\n<li>Yes, I remember you telling me about this. This helps a big deal, no question about this. But the idea of a sentence space is still around, albeit its inpact is reduced. For instance, when you axiomatize the verb \"shoots\" you do so by applying some features to the object and the subject of the action. This is a very neat thing to do (albeit I can imagine it doesn't work in some circumstances), but it may be still difficult, in practice, to say what does it mean to \"apply\" such features. In any case I'll wait to see what happens!</li>\n</ol>",

That toolkit will soon prove very useful in a very broad swathe of neuroscience -- there's even a subfield called \"integrative neuroscience\" -- and I've recently spent a lot of time studying it. I don't really do any data analysis. My interests are in the theoretical side, both with respect to \"how we navigate spaces\" (from paths to proofs), and also with respect to notions of natural computation, information-processing in complex systems, and cybernetics broadly.</p>\n<p>As many of us have, I've been thinking increasingly about the question of \"how to do scientific modelling\" and \"how to specify models\" in such a way that we can translate models across disciplines (as they exist today). At the same time, I think we could do with better tools to assist this: how should this data be represented digitally? How is it represented inside the brain?</p>\n<p>Because mathematical spaces are (for me at least) prototypical, I'm trying to figure out how, by stealing ideas from homotopy type theory, we could think about how we navigate (eg) from the premises to the conclusion of a logical deduction. The paper written at the end is a physical artefact witnessing that journey, but along the way the route must have been represented and planned inside the author's brain. And somehow this route should correspond to the abstract witness that exists in some model of type theory.</p>\n<p>Anyhow thanks for the connection: I'll send you both an e-mail :)</p>",

It's generally accepted that quantum computers will eventually need to use some kind of codes to protect the precious qubits. By another example of the weird efficacy of mathematics in physics, the most promising quantum code comes from (is?) the cellular homology of a 2-dimensional manifold. And this idea overlaps with condensed matter physics: such a \"code\" can be seen as a simple example of a 2d topological quantum field theory. So while I wait for someone to actually build one of these things, I get to think about a lot of cool mathematics, much of which involves category theory.</p>\n<p>I also have a semi-regular collaboration going on with James Dolan. James is interested in categorified algebraic geometry, homotopy theory and the Langlands program. These big ideas are so big, possibly eating all of mathematics, I have a suspicion that they also have a lot to do with quantum computing. We will see.</p>",

I'm a data scientist with a electrical engineering background (information theory, graph theory, bayesian statistics) with a pretty weak background in category theory and abstract math in general; I've always been an applications first person. I've found that my intuitions often line up with abstractions from category theory, but that I don't always have the mathematical language to realize that! I'm working through Riehl, Fong, and Spivak's books in order to rectify that terminology gap and so I can understand the elegance of some results from category theory more formally.</p>\n<p>Domains that I'm interested in that I think category theory can bring some nice abstractions to: include causal inference/ probabilistic graphical models and network theory (especially directed hypergraphs, networks of oscillators, complex adaptive systems). I'm particularly interested in the applications to meta-science (think <a href=\"https://www.darpa.mil/program/automating-scientific-knowledge-extraction\">https://www.darpa.mil/program/automating-scientific-knowledge-extraction</a>) and to dynamical systems work in computational epidemiology, biology, and neuroscience. As such, super interested in sheaf theory, topos theory, hodge theory,  and (stochastic) petri nets. I've been eagerly playing with the tools built by James Fairbanks (and the rest of the Julia community) and reading all the work from Fong, Spivak, Tuyveras, Baez, and now Evan Patterson's thesis in a hand-wavey fashion, and hoping to go back later with some more rigor.</p>",

Since, I'm an Engineer by degree (just graduated) doing so much CT made me feel different from the rest of my class. I am also very driven towards Cognitive Science and Neuroscience and I keep looking for bridges and ways CT can be made a language neuroscientists can think in, (in my dreams I feel this will bring Grothendieck like revolution to the field) So far I've found some works which try to aim in the direction by Gomez Ramirez, Brown and Porter, Andrée Ehresmann. But, I feel very anxious because I don't know where do I fit in and if I will be able to contribute as much I feel driven to, further in academia. <br>\nI can't even ascertain the departments I should apply to for Grad school, especially given the COVID scenario, the uncertainty has increased many-fold (manifold? anyone) When I came across this conference, thanks to the smart AI of Google who learned from my searches and recommended ACT2020 in my feed, I was delighted. This is the best thing to experience sitting at home. Thanks to the organizers. <br>\nI would love to have any pointers from anyone present here as to how I (as an engineer, who used to make flexible printed electronics) should go forward touching neuroscience and physics simultaneously with CT sword in my hard (which needs a lot of brushing, sharpening because in this group I probably know the least CT).</p>",

A couple of years later, Ralph Abraham introduced me to Lawvere (in a Parisian pub). In 1968 I audited a course on category theory given by Samuel Eilenberg. In Summer 1969 I attended the Summer Seminar in Category Theory at Bowdoin College, where I attended the lectures by Saunders Mac Lane (where he presented my example of continuous map as an adjunction). By Fall 1969 I was enrolled as a student of Lawvere at Dalhousie University. My best friend was Radu Diaconescu. I did <em>not</em> impress Lawvere much at all, and I went over to be mentored by Barry Mitchell. We became friends over ensuing decades, mostly by telephone. A couple of years ago he said, \"You know, back then you were not as good as you thought you were.\" This sort of hurt my feelings, except that I do not recall thinking myself as good at mathematics. Enthusiastic, way yes, quick-minded, not. I am still enthusiastic. My passion is to categorize my choice of modern theoretical biology, the part of systems biology that leaves genetic reductionism aside, and moves to the realm of biological autonomy. The first step is to take care of adequately explaining micro and macro thermodynamics. Then there is the matter of explicating a recent foundational principle called \"closure of constraints.\"</p>",

I'll assume it is the previous post in the \"Introduce Yourself!\" thread, and in particular the sentence \" It's the only thing that can explain how it is possible for Category Theory to be discussed on Twitter.\" <br>\nI think here is is fundamental to understand the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect\">network effect</a>, which is a very interesting mathematical principle, about the  faster growth in the number of connections on a (telephone,...) network as it adds new nodes, and so the value of the network as a whole. All of silicon valley is built on this. From the internet itself, to the market clout of Microsoft products, to the success of Facebook, etc... It's a mathematical principle they understand and take very seriously. The more users are on a system that is about connections grows, the more value the system gains as a whole, as it is easier to make connections.</p>",

I put all the great stuff I found together as an annotated bibliography. I am a beginner at this and would love to hear thoughts and feedback from people here on it.

Had an exchange almost ten years ago with Catarina Dutilh Novaes, me saying that there would be Viagra ads all over the list of Women in Logic, she saying we'll worry about it when it does and she was right. We haven't had issues, so far. Women in Programming Languages  have their list in GitHub, but  the point here is not to make sure category theorists know how to use github, but to make the old excuse that people don't know women doing CT even more lame. (I don't understand it, as I keep having to remove rubbish from even slideshare comments...)</p>",

This is probably the main reason I thought CT would be of great help: what are the fundamental components of all these things that I like and that seem to pop up in apparently unrelated fields?</p>\n<p>To give a few key words that might help place me (but don't make me an expert on): </p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>cybernetics</em>, which I know is a topic already of interest to some here and one of the main reasons for me to like cross-disciplinary ideas (control theory + info theory + neuroscience), </li>\n<li><em>active inference</em>, in some sense a modern reading of some topics originating in cybernetics (how do we use <del>info theory</del> inference + control to understand what brains do) over which I worked during my PhD (in some ways also after that), and which is potentially interesting for at least another person here :P (even with all of its problems).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is quite likely I'll spend some time just lurking for now, especially in the streams (with questions) for beginners, but in the meantime, nice to meet you all!</p>",

I should say that my ACT talk is somewhat troublesome and I've been working on cleaning it up quite significantly.  I've now got quite a general scheme for describing the structure of active inference systems as an indexed functor from an indexed category of statistical games (describing the statistical part) over polynomials into an indexed category of dynamical systems (of various kinds), also over polynomials.  I don't like to announce things before I'm feeling secure in them, so I haven't said much recently.  But I gave a talk sketching some of this material recently, and the slides are at <a href=\"https://tsmithe.net/papers/20210317-cgt-talk.pdf\">https://tsmithe.net/papers/20210317-cgt-talk.pdf</a> -- that talk didn't cover much of the \"active\" part of \"active inference\" (which is where the polynomials come in), and I'm writing that up at the moment.  I also believe that, in 'nice' cases, the indexed functor I mentioned should have a right adjoint which associates to a dynamical system a \"canonical statistical game\", but I haven't finished working the details of that part out.</p>",

And oh wow! I was just reading <a href=\"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W17-7205.pdf\">your paper on annotations in the SICK corpus</a>- I'm working on an annotation tool for coreference - I'd love to hear how you think about grounding/explicitation of referents for inference, and your work on entailment! Would it be O.K. if I emailed you?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>hi <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"395604\">@Joe Brucker</span> , we actually have 3 papers on SICK( one on entailments, the one in contradictions you're reading and one about \"one-word-apart\" pairs of sentences in SICK). I thought in 2016 that SICK would be an easy place to test the new neural nets emerging from Google at that time, the Parsey McParseface times. but we're still working on it 4 years later! oh well.  </p>\n<p>Katerina and I have these nice demos for our work: GKR Demo--<br>\n<a href=\"http://lap0973.sprachwiss.uni-konstanz.de:8080/sem.mapper/\">http://lap0973.sprachwiss.uni-konstanz.de:8080/sem.mapper/</a> describes our KR system, while Hy-NLI Demo-- <a href=\"http://lap0973.sprachwiss.uni-konstanz.de:8081/gnli/hynli.jsp--\">http://lap0973.sprachwiss.uni-konstanz.de:8081/gnli/hynli.jsp--</a> is an overview of our hybrid--neural and symbolic-- inference system, if you're interested. Katerina just defended her PhD in Konstanz. So to your question, we don't ground things explicitly, we use WordNet and a generic ontology SUMO for our concepts. and sure, please email, I'd love to chat more.</p>",

Offline, I can tell you how some traders get around this haha.</p>\n<p>I'm also thinking it could also be modeled as discrete, would that make it easier? At an operational level, and depending on the asset/exchange/flow, the price may have artificial 'ceilings' and 'floors' from the limit orders and exchange halting. </p>\n<p>The inter-asset/intra-asset self-fulfilling prophecies are all too real, I can still feel the stress of stop-loss slippage.

So it's not something that can be reasonably simulated or analyzed. The best thing you can hope to do is to define some metrics that, for some reason, give approximate predictions for this system</p>",

I started studying simplicial methods in homological algebra because monads are a basic structure in computer science logic and categorical semantics, and I wanted to learn about their history and how they originated. So I went back and read a bunch of the early work on this stuff - Godement's book on sheaf cohomology where he shows that you can use simplicial sheaves constructed by the bar resolution of a monad to give simplicial formulas in sheaf cohomology for the cup product/cross product/Steenrod squares, Barr and Beck's work on acyclic models and homological algebra with respect to a monad, stuff like that. It does seem that wherever you have monads you should be able to define some of the basic concepts of simplicial homotopy theory or cohomology, and I am wondering whether it's possible to give an interpretation of these cohomology groups or homotopy groups in the context of the monads arising in computer science logic or formal semantics (an interpretation that would be interesting to computer scientists, I mean.)</p>\n<p>I'll mention one specific example of a monad I'm interested in. In Bart Jacobs' book on categorical logic and type theory he gives a very interesting argument that basically all the higher level notions of logic (quantification, equality, logical operators) are ultimately determined by the structural rules of weakening and contraction through some adjunctions related to them. These weakening and contraction operations fit together into a comonad in the category of propositions; this comonad is kind of the logical backbone of the category, as all of the other features of the logic are necessarily determined by it. I would be interested in whether you can define homotopy groups with respect to this comonad which are interesting.</p>\n<p>I also want to point out that topos theory has been very influential in categorical logic and type theory, and this also originated in sheaf cohomology theory. It seems like more than a coincidence that both monads and topoi originated in sheaf cohomology specifically and jumped to computer science logic. Surely there is more going on here than the mere coincidence of the same formal structures appearing in both disciplines.</p>\n<p>More recently I've begun to think that a lot of the constructions of simplicial homotopy theory or simplicial methods in homological algebra are best understood in terms of monoidal category theory, as the category of simplicial sets is the free cocomplete monoidal category with distinguished monoid, and the category of simplicial Abelian groups is something similar but with Ab-enriched dropped in appropriately throughout, so I have been trying to work out to my own satisfaction sufficiently \"monoidal\" derivations of many basic notions of simplicial homological algbera.</p>",

I'd be happy to talk about it in more detail for this reason so I can understand the relationship between what I've been doing and the existing literature. Hopefully all this isn't known or out of vogue. But I'll give you an example. Recently I came up with what I think is a satisfactory a priori account of what chain complexes are and why they exist. Given any simplicial set, we can interpret this as a formal schema for gluing together copies of a given monoid in a category and its higher tensor powers, the usual geometric realization of this is the special case where the monoidal product on Top is taken to be the join, and the distinguished monoid is the singleton space. In my opinion this gives a very good motivation for what simplicial sets \"are\" because for any cocomplete monoidal category C with distinguished monoid M there is a unique cocontinuous strong monoidal functor from SSet to C sending the n-simplex to M^{n+1} and preserving the unit and multiplication maps of the monoid. (Here the monoidal product on SSet is Day convolution.) Now we can characterize SAb the same way, if we say that the category C should be Ab-enriched, and tensored over Ab, say that the tensor product Ab\\otimes C -&gt; C is cocontinuous in both variables. So given any simplicial Abelian group X, there is a \"geometric realization\" of X with respect to the monoid M, computed by a coend \\int^{n\\in \\Delta}  X_n\\otimes M^{n+1}, which tells how to glue together M and its higher tensor powers according to the face and degeneracy maps of X. It turns out that if you simply sit down and compute this coend, all the degeneracies of X dissolve and you are left with the Moore normalization of X. Similarly the cosimplicial object n \\mapsto M^{n+1} has a dual kind of Moore normalization M' which is a cochain complex in C, and the original coend simplifies to \\int^n N(X)_n \\otimes M'_n. <br>\nSo, by purely computational motivations, i.e. trying to compute the \"realization\" of a simplicial Abelian group, we are naturally led to replace it by its Moore normalization, and this can give some a priori justification for the notion of chain complex (it is a reduction of a simplicial Abelian group which suffices for the purpose of gluing together monoids in additive categories and their higher tensor powers)</p>",

I graduated from MIT in May of 2020 in AeroAstro focusing on controls, real-time systems, telecommunications and am just about to get started on an Erasmus Mundus Joint Masters Degree in Embedded Computing Systems. Even though I absolutely love math, a calculus proof-based math class broke my spirit in my first year as an undergrad, so I decided to pursue it more as a hobby since then. Now that I'm getting into research I really want to marry math into my papers, and Category Theory has caught my eye. I really love reading Tai-Danae's pieces (including topology from a CT perspective which I'm very excited to read in its entirety), and looking into the Fong-Spivak applied CT books and lectures on YouTube. Since I have a year before I choose a research topic, my main goal is to learn as much CT, and as many examples of application, as I can!

I've become interested in category theory through a pretty circuitous route:  over the past few years, I (with some wonderful, very smart coauthors) have written some papers connecting public-key cryptography (and more powerful cryptographic primitives, like fully homomorphic encryption if you know what that is) with mathematically structured simple primitives (i.e. one-way functions or pseudorandom functions, and again, apologies for the cryptographic terms).  It seems like mathematically structured computational hardness assumptions are required in order to build certain cryptographic primitives (and in some cases, we can prove this explicitly, although we would obviously like to be able to prove more powerful statements in this regard).  However, sometime last year, we (myself and others working on these problems) realized that we didn't have strong enough tools for handling the mathematical structure in the types of proofs we wanted to write about this, and thus needed to learn category theory.  So here I am!</p>\n<p>If anyone is interested in \"computational category theory,\" I'd love to hear your thoughts, and please feel free to reach out.

I took a quick look at your paper.  It looks interesting, but I haven't had time to go through the details.  In the intro, you say, \"To do this, we bypass the problem of modelling cryptographical primitives categorically...\" which is what we have basically tried to do.  Our formulations are probably pretty appalling to properly trained mathematicians though--some of this is due to the difficulty of modelling computational primitives, and much of it is probably due to our inexperience and lack of knowledge of category theory.

I graduated a few months ago from Berkeley, and I hope to apply to a math PhD program this fall.</p>\n<p>I would really like to learn more about CT and computation, the fact of a connection between which is awesome. In particular, just from naively reading nLab I'd be very curious to work through a precise description of the Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence. I've also gotten the idea that categories with various levels of axiomatized structure \"admit various computations\" like taking pullbacks, factoring morphisms...! And they have different \"internal logics\", which I don't understand. I'd really like to have an oversimplified model of the circle of ideas here.<br>\nI've also just found Lawvere's 1969 article ( <a href=\"http://emis.matem.unam.mx/journals/TAC/reprints/articles/15/tr15.pdf\">http://emis.matem.unam.mx/journals/TAC/reprints/articles/15/tr15.pdf</a> ) seeming to abstract the fixed point approach to the halting problem and Gödel's first theorem (and other stuff) to a property of CCC's. This is all absolutely incredible to me and a lot to take in. Is there any \"categorical\" model of computation which is Turing complete/nicely related to the classical ones?</p>\n<p>I guess the question I'm ultimately going to end up asking here is, what should I do next if I want to seriously pursue these topics?

It has been a wild ride since then.  Just came to the understanding that, as George Spencer-Brown wrote, if something is obvious from experience, but very hard to prove, then it is probably very close to an axiom of the real world.  Turns out the Jordan Curve Theorem is hard to prove because it is a statement of the definition of a distinction in the Laws of Form.

I have been applying CT to combinatorics since  1965 when I discovered a notion of morphism for Ford-Fulkerson flows on networks.  After several years of proving Sperner-type theorems for ranked posets (the largest antichain is the largest  rank) using FLOW morphisms, I decided to look for morphisms of other combinatorial problems.  I did not have to look very far: My first paper (1962) had solved the edge-isoperimetric problem on the graph of the n-cube and I realized that the techniques that I and others had used to solve similar problems on combinatorial structures were actually morphismological. The morphisms for those problems were analogs of symmetrization, the transformations that Jakob Steiner had used in 1840 to give the first rigorous proof of the classical isoperimetric problem in the plane. So I called the morphisms for combinatorial isoperimetric problems \"Steiner operations\". In 2004 I published a monograph on Steiner operations entitled, \"Global Methods for Combinatorial Isoperimetric Problems\". Currently I am writing another monograph entitled, \"The Morphismology of Combinatorics\" to summarize what I have learned since1965 about the application of morphisms and the categorial structure they generate to solving combinatorial problems.</p>",

I am also a friend of <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"332609\">@Dean Young</span> , who I see just joined too.</p>\n<p>My main interests are spread all over all the places. Haha... but lately I have been thinking about 'everything classifies something', univalence, holography, modulation, modality (cohesion etc), tangles, cobordisms, groupoidification, species, Goodwillie, Chu and (co)bar stuff, coends, 'tensorality'. Idk, just kind of my palette of ideas, connotations and contexts.</p>\n<p>I have a strong desire to see stuff synthesized, and I contemplate my measures of pleasures in these syntheses. I think about variation–integration in analogy to analysis–synthesis, and I wonder if higher (co)monadic, spherical diagrams and their duals can capture nestings of modalities. I use cooking metaphors a lot, like 'this geometry tastes spicy and slightly under-baked'. (Sidenote: do you think we might benefit from topologizing qualia? It might taste good idk/lol)</p>\n<p>Sorry to make such a long introduction. Like I said, I am really happy to be here! <span aria-label=\"peace sign\" class=\"emoji emoji-270c\" role=\"img\" title=\"peace sign\">:peace_sign:</span>️</p>",

I finished my PhD in the School of Mathematics of the University of Edinburgh a couple of years ago and I am currently the president of the <a href=\"https://semf.org.es/\">Society for Multidisciplinary and Fundamental Research</a> while I continue with my mathematical research and look for postdoc positions. I am currently based between Edinburgh (UK) and Alicante (Spain).</p>\n<p>I first came across category theory due to my work in differential geometry and the mathematical foundations of physics. I was introduced to the subject by Tom Leinster and his students here in Edinburgh. I have recently refocused my interest in category theory due to my current research on higher order systems and, in particular, higher arity structures in mathematics, physics and computer science.</p>\n<p>The main goals of the higher arity research project (which I lead) are outlined in our website that went online recently:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arity.science/\">https://arity.science/</a></p>\n<p>Athough the project as a whole is highly interdisciplinary in scope (we have collaborators ranging from biology to art history), what pertains to category theory, and the reason I am excited to join this online community, is that we are looking for higher arity generalizations of the basic notion of category. This means, in particular, increasing the number of objects related by morphisms in a way that is generally non-sequential and doesn't necessarily conform to an input-output framework. Notions  such as operads and poly/multicategories (and their higher generalizations) are steps in the right direction for the sort of generalizations that we are searching for, but they are still firmly anchored in sequentiality and input-output, i.e. they are all largely formulable in terms of directed graphs, put simply \"they are mostly about arrows\". The idea is to take (directed or otherwise) hypergraphs as a starting point for higher arity analogues of category-like objects.</p>\n<p>There is some work on this topic of higher arity categories from <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF01229967.pdf\">Topentcharov</a> in the 1980s but it doesn't seem that much more has been done in that direction. Any pointers to relevant literature are greatly appreciated. We have rediscovered an example of a known structure called a heapoid (a partial ternary operation satisfying a slight modification of associativity) where our approach seems to clarify things greatly and it paves the way to finding meaningful n-ary generalizations of associativity. We describe this in our recent paper:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05456\">Heaps of Fish: arrays, generalized associativity and heapoids</a></p>\n<p>Any comments or criticisms are most welcome!</p>",

The problem that I see with polycategories is that they are not very \"primitive\" as n-ary structures in the sense that composition is still a binary operation on morphisms. An easy example of a ternary (pre?)category is the class of sets and ternay relations. If we understand composition as a generalization from binary relations, i.e. an operation that takes several relations of a fixed arity and gives another relation of the same arity (the usual case is a pair of binary relations compose to give another binary relation, which in our eyes is the prime example that motivates the usual definition of composition of morphisms in categories), then there are many posibilities. In section 4.3 of our previous paper we identify at least 10 different well-defined composition operations taking trios of ternary relations on sets: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09738\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09738</a>. This means that if there exists a satisfactory definition of \"ternary category\" understood as a collection of objects and ternary morphisms that compose in a particular way, it is far from being unique.</p>",

At the moment, I’m waiting to hear back from a few PhD programs in math I’m waitlisted at, hoping to get some good news soon.</p>\n<p>I’ve been interested in category theory for a little while now, and have been actively digging into it to try to learn more for the past year. I found myself in a weird spot as a math &amp; ES major interested specifically in abstract algebra/topology— I had no idea how I was going to bridge the gap in my interests and apply abstract math to environmental issues. I ended up stumbling into categorical systems theory about a year ago, though, and that changed a whole lot!</p>\n<p>Since then, I’ve been trying to absorb as much category theory as I can outside my coursework. My interests have shifted a little bit away from applied category theory toward higher categories/categorical logic as of recently, but I still love thinking about compositional systems &amp; games!</p>\n<p>At the moment, I’m working on-and-off on a hobby project to “internalize Minesweeper and related puzzles” in the language of category theory, and use fixed points/coalgebras of certain endofunctors to study the various levels of “solvability” that a Minesweeper board (or other puzzle, like a Sudoku board or a jigsaw puzzle) can have. I’m pretty close to something really neat, I think, but I also need time to flesh out how exactly I want to organize all the work I’ve done and communicate it to others.</p>\n<p>The past couple days, I’ve also been messing around with the idea of using nonstandard-shaped globe categories to define nonstandard higher categories. More specifically, instead of just using finite ordinals/omega to shape a globe category, maybe we could also use larger ordinals or non-totally-ordered well-partial-orders. I would like to figure out exactly which well-partial-orders P admit reasonably-shaped globe categories (if it isn’t just all of them), then take models of those globe categories in Set to make P-graphs. Then, I’d like to construct a monad on the category of those P-graphs that gives the free weak P-category’s underlying P-graph on any given P-graph, and finally look at its algebras. Long term goal is to get to the functoriality of this construction over the category of well-partial-orders and monotone maps between them, and take some sort of Grothendieck construction to be able to talk about functors between differently-shaped P-categories.</p>\n<p>That was a lot— got carried away! Wrapping up, I’m happy to be here and I’m looking forward to sharing thoughts &amp; learning more from everyone. Take care!</p>",

I exist in a category theory vacuum here, so it's largely a solo effort, and often feels overwhelming.

My graduate research was focused on analogues of \"smoothness\" in discrete manifolds. Currently, I am working through MacLane as well as trying to figure out the intuition behind the delooping of an object.</p>\n<p>That said, what pushed me over to actually joining this server is a particular question! I'm reading Baez's 2011 \"Division Algebras and Quantum Theory\", but the nLab page on Hilbert Space links to an MO post which appears to demonstrate that Hilbert spaces can only ever be real or complex: <a href=\"https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3625943/can-hilbert-spaces-be-defined-over-fields-other-than-mathbb-r-and-mathbb-c/4184099#4184099\">https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3625943/can-hilbert-spaces-be-defined-over-fields-other-than-mathbb-r-and-mathbb-c/4184099#4184099</a>. So, I'm wondering what I'm missing. The Baez paper describes K-Hilbert spaces over some normed division algebra K, but the positive definiteness of the inner product uses some mysterious order structure on K that I can't quite figure out. The MO post seems to more carefully worry about this order, but then the conclusion seems to be that quaternionic Hilbert spaces don't exist! What's going on here?</p>\n<p>Anyway, apart from the above naïve question, my more general hope is that this chat will seduce me into interesting situations with lots of neat people and beautiful math.</p>",

It will not be for a long time that I can finish due to slow progress (it took months for me to finally sort of understand the basic machinery of category theory, which is essentially still where I am now), but in the meantime I will try to read some of the posts on here and maybe learn something new!</p>",

It's a bit different, but sometimes I reflect that the mathematical structures introduced relatively early on in education (for example in high school) are surprisingly complex. For example, a great deal of focus is placed on the real numbers, and the real numbers have a lot of structure! (In the setting of the real numbers we have an ordering, we can add and subtract, multiply and divide, and we can talk about limits of sequences.) By contrast, the concept of a category seems simpler in some ways (at least to me). So sometimes I wonder if it could be helpful to introduce arguably simpler things like monoids and preorders (and maybe even categories) before focusing so much on the real numbers!</p>\n<p>Anyways, welcome again to the zulip!</p>",

        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"277503\">@David Egolf</span> You're very right! Learning category theory has actually given be a much different perspective on mathematical objects than I had before. It allowed me to realize certain mathematical objects are not made of one cohesive structure, but can be represented as continuously building up more and more structure onto something. For instance, the real numbers as you describe, seem like a logical conclusion if you are building up from natural numbers using recursion (IE, from something like the Peano axioms). However, in category theory, that same construction is some underlying set (the set of real numbers) plus the structure of a topological space (the real line) plus the structure of an ordering/poset (where one number is \"less than\" another number) plus the structure of a field (to add, multiply, subtract, and divide). Euclidean space is another one of these, where one has an underlying set of points (underlying set) PLUS a topology (topological space) PLUS a metric (metric space) PLUS a differentiable structure (smooth manifold) PLUS measures (measureable space) PLUS a way of assigning vectors (vector space) and so on. Decomposing Euclidean spaces in this way really put things into perspective for me of how this seemingly natural structure, where deciding to do various things within it seemed natural and intuitive, was in fact some crazy mathematical convergence of all these concepts.<br>\nAlso, I've read some of your questions, they're quite similar to ones I have, so I look forward to reading more of them!</p>",

        "content": "<p>Hello! <br>\nMy name is Adam and I am a lover of logic, tentatively returning to the world of category theory. </p>\n<p>I came to the world of pure mathematics via philosophy. I did my undergrad at Princeton 2011-2015, where I worked with Hans Halvorson, who works on category theory applications to logic and the philosophy of science. <br>\nI took courses like Formal Logic,  Mathematical Logic, Philosophical Logic, and Set Theory. <br>\nI fell in love with the methods and subject matter of mathematical logic. </p>\n<p>It was empowering for me to learn that a great deal of mathematics can be understood in terms of formal definitions and which statements entail others. An 'intuition' or ability to 'visualize,' while often useful, was not <em>necessary.</em> <br>\nOne can construct a rigorous and accurate proof using only an understanding of the logical structure of definitions and theorems. One can engage 'semantically;' What is true? or 'syntactically;' What can I derive? <br>\nAND the two perspectives are connected. <br>\nThis ‘logical’ perspective allowed me to be successful in standard mathematics courses like Real Analysis, Topology, and Graph Theory, beyond the world of logic and foundations. </p>\n<p>I was encouraged by Hans to take his course in category theory for undergraduates. <br>\nI was further enticed by the promise that recent work in logic used categorical methods, and that category theory was proposed as an alternative foundation by philosophers of mathematics. </p>\n<p>It is a bit bizarre because I entered this course (as well as later pure math courses) with really only a logician's perspective; category theory was another formal theory that could be investigated, so I learned 'synthetic' category theory only, before encountering, say, abstract or linear algebra. <br>\nI first heard the words 'group' and 'homomorphism' and 'vector space' in this course, as examples of concrete categories.<br>\nI wrote a senior (philosophy) thesis on structuralist philosophy of mathematics. </p>\n<p>From 2017-2019 I was a master's student at Carnegie Mellon University, mostly because I was enticed by the work there in homotopy type theory and proof assistants. I took courses on proof theory, automated theorem proving in LEAN, and synthetic homotopy theory. <br>\nAt CMU I tried to contribute to the program on HoTT, with the help of people like Jonas Frey. <br>\nWithout much experience with independent research in mathematics, I was not able to successfully complete a master's thesis. </p>\n<p>At the moment I am working as an adjunct lecturer at a small engineering school in Boston, where I teach courses in Discrete Math. I enjoy the opportunity to show the virtues of the logical perspective of mathematics to aspiring engineers and programmers. <br>\nI can expound at length about the general idea of category theory, but am hopelessly rusty when it comes to actually proving/computing results about it. My hope in joining this community is to have resources and motivation for self-study. </p>\n<p>Generally my research interests are epistemic and methodological questions surrounding the practice of pure mathematics. <br>\nWhat is the epistemic role of a proof? <br>\nWhat is the value of 'purely syntactic' reasoning? <br>\nWhen are two formal theories 'equivalent?' <br>\nWhat do we really accomplish when we establish a soundness/completeness result for a formal theory? </p>\n<p>I do not know if I plan to pursue further academic research in these areas, but I know that questions like these excite me, as does the ability to address them using formal tools. </p>\n<p>Many years ago, I was told that universal and existential quantification can be understood in terms of an adjunction, and for now, understanding that adjunction is my concrete goal. </p>\n<p>... I realize my post here is longer than I intended... and despite some attempts to truncate it, I have decided to publish it at it's current length!</p>",

So the best answer to the question \"is rigor just a ritual\" is to study rigor as a mathematical concept, to quantify it, to abstract it, and to turn it into something new, flexible and beautiful.

This is the program of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_quantum_mechanics\">categorical quantum mechanics</a> (see also <a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/quantum+information+theory+via+dagger-compact+categories\">here</a>).</p>\n<p>Another approach is so called \"topos quantum theory\" where one looks at the category of presheaves on the C*-algebra or von Neumann algebras of operators on a given Hilbert space, <a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Bohr+topos\">which form a topos</a>.  </p>\n<p>(I hope I got this right, I am not an expert on any of this.)</p>\n<p>My project, which i am just starting with, is about yet another approach, probably more closely related to the former of the above mentioned approaches.

The main difference is that, coming from classical (boolean) logic, you either drop distributivity or  the law of excluded middle (lem).<br>\n Dropping distributivity leads to what is traditionally known as \"quantum logic\" and goes back to Birkhoff and von Neumann (1936). This version of quantum logic is more closely related to (monoidal) categorical quantum mechanics.<br>\nAnother approach is to use the internal logic of the aforementioned Bohr topos, which is a Heyting algebra and therefore is distributive, but lem does not hold in this logical system.</p>",

It seems the first way presented of doing QM in CT is just the direct way- to do the usual Hilbert space formulation of QM, but just in the categorical setting of the category of Hilbert Spaces. But the interesting thing here is that many phenomena of QM seem to remain even when you abstract away to the more general setting of dagger compact categories. The other ways seem to leverage the notion of categories, especially toposes, having an \"internal language\" or \"internal logic\" to encapsulate stuff about quantum mechanics. </p>\n<p>I look forward to learning more about this, it sounds fascinating!</p>",

My focus is on the power locales and how we can use them to give a purely locale theory based approach to topos theory. The idea is that the true 'object of study' is a category of locales (suitably axiomatised ...) rather than  an elementary topos, so that the toposes are 'just' the discrete objects. For example we can represent geometric morphisms as adjunctions between categories  of locales and can see the hyperconnected localic factorisation as a relatively trivial categorical construction when viewed in this way.</p>",
