I have found most written diagram chasing proofs to be a big hassle to read because a single big diagram is drawn and you must visualize which parts are drawn at each step of the proof. My idea to solve this would be to have a diagram for each step and indicators in the text to see which diagrams the reader should look at. Obviously, this demands more work from the writer because they have to edit a diagram for each step. Thus, I was thinking that within quiver, there could be a way to put every part of the diagram (objects and arrows) into groups and then quiver generates a diagram for each group displaying only the parts within that group. This way, one could draw the whole diagram on quiver, select the parts of the diagram that should be displayed at step 1,2,etc. and quiver generates a diagram for step 1,2,etc. automatically.</p>\n<p>A better way (imo) to display this would be to have a slideshow instead of many diagrams and inside the text, there are indicators to tell you when to move to the next step. This would be very hard to implement on a pdf I guess, but that could be done as an extension of the embedding capabilities quiver already has in webpages.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Hi <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"276092\">@Nathanael Arkor</span> </p>\n<p>In <a href=\"#narrow/channel/229111-community.3A-general/topic/tikzcd.20creator/near/500527120\">this message</a>, you asked for feedback on Quiver. I'd be happy to share my thoughts here. This will be a rather detailed message, focusing primarily on the user interface and accessibility aspects of Quiver.  </p>\n<h3>A Quick Disclaimer</h3>\n<p>Everything I mention here is, of course, just my personal perspective. If you disagree with any point, that's absolutely fine! I'm also evaluating Quiver as if I were a first-time user, to highlight areas where new users might struggle.  </p>\n<h3>Feedback</h3>\n<p>1) There's nothing in the UI that clearly explains how to create nodes and arrows, which is the core functionality. The top menu doesn't include these options either.  </p>\n<p>2) The top menu is the first thing a user sees, but it doesn't provide the most essential information for getting started. Many of its features might not be needed when creating an initial diagram.  </p>\n<p>3) The keyboard shortcuts listed in the top menu may not be relevant for new users. Perhaps they could be moved to a separate menu for more advanced users.  </p>\n<p>4) The font size in the top menu is quite small, making readability difficult.  </p>\n<p>5) The \"Show Hints\" feature in the top menu isn't self-explanatory. It appears to display keyboard shortcuts, but it's unclear whether they can be used in that context.  </p>\n<p>6) As a new user, I don't immediately understand the purpose of \"Show Queue.\" What is being queued, and why?  </p>\n<p>7) When clicking on a cell, the prompt says \"Add vertex.\" However, this doesn't explain how to actually create the vertex. Since the user has already decided to create a vertex, a clearer prompt like \"Click again to create a vertex\" might be more helpful.  </p>\n<p><strong>Suggestion:</strong> Consider allowing vertex creation with a single click.  </p>\n<p>8) When a vertex is created, an input field appears at the bottom, but it lacks a visible label. As a new user, I didn't immediately realize that this field allows editing the LaTeX content for the vertex. This could make the feature less accessible.  </p>\n<p>9) The same issue applies to the color input field. It lacks a visible label and, when not in focus, has a black font on a black background, making it nearly invisible.  </p>\n<p>10) Since a vertex is created with a double-click, it would be intuitive if another double-click removed it. However, this doesn't happen. Instead, removal requires pressing the \"Backspace\" key or using the \"Delete\" option in the top menu.  </p>\n<p>11) The UI doesn't provide clear guidance on how to create arrows. While it's not difficult to figure out, a brief guide for new users would improve usability.  </p>\n<p>12) The blue background used to indicate focus may not be sufficient for accessibility. Using the browser's default outline would improve visibility, making it clearer when, for instance, a label input field is active while creating an arrow.  </p>\n<p>13) The process of creating an arrow might feel unintuitive to new users because two things open simultaneously: the label input field and the arrow menu on the right.  </p>\n<p>14) The arrow menu presents a large number of options, which can be overwhelming. Perhaps the most commonly used options could be displayed more prominently, with the others accessible via a \"More\" button.  </p>\n<p>15) The contrast in the arrow menu is quite low. Both the text and graphical elements are dark, making them difficult to distinguish against the black background. A white font color would improve accessibility.  </p>\n<p>16) The purpose of the buttons in the arrow menu (arranged in a grid) isn't immediately clear. It took me some time to understand that they control the arrow's tail, line, and tip. Adding visible labels would make this more intuitive.  </p>\n<p>17) The grid layout in the arrow menu can be misleading. It visually suggests that items in the same row are related, but they are actually independent. Perhaps restructuring the menu into three clearly labeled sectionsâ€”\"Arrow Tail,\" \"Arrow Line,\" and \"Arrow Tip\"â€”would help. These sections could be collapsible by default, reducing visual clutter.  </p>\n<p>18) The term \"Level\" is not self-explanatory. Since it actually refers to the number of lines, renaming it to \"Lines\" might make more sense.  </p>\n<p>19) The \"Position\" slider in the arrow menu initially seemed to control arrow placement, but it actually adjusts the label's position. This is confusing because other sliders in that section modify the arrow itself. Clarifying its purpose would help.  </p>\n<p>20) Some buttons in the arrow menu use HTML tooltips (which appear on hover). These are not accessible and are not recommended by the WAI. Visible labels or ARIA labels would be a better alternative.  </p>\n<p>21) The outline for the color input field in the arrow menu has low contrast. With the default color, it appears as a black box on a black background, making it hard to locate.  </p>\n<p>22) Bottom menu: It's unclear what \"Macros\" is for and what kind of URL should be entered there.

A few counter-opinions though:</p>\n<p>3) I like encouraging new users to use keyboard shortcuts; there's nothing intrinsically advanced about a keyboard shortcut, and any and all users may like to see them.  I don't see any drawback to including them on the menu.</p>\n<p>10) Disagree.  I think it's pretty standard that clicks and double-clicks \"open\" or \"run\" things.  Creating a vertex falls into that category for me; deleting one does not.  I can't think of any other UI where a double-click deletes something.  The key on the keyboard is labeled \"Delete\" for a reason.</p>\n<p>17) I like the idea of labeling the columns, but I wouldn't want them to be collapsed by default; having to click extra things to expand to get to the options I want is annoying.</p>",

        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"414434\">@Martin Brandenburg</span>: thank you very much for the detailed feedback! I'll give detailed responses below (I'm on the move, so apologies if they're a little terse).</p>\n<p>1 &amp; 11) When you first open <strong>quiver</strong>, you get a window explaining exactly how to create diagrams. (Though I think it would be helpful to have a button to open this again easily after dismissing it.)</p>\n<p>2) This is the norm for software. When you first open Microsoft Word, for instance, you see all the options from the start. I think it is more confusing to have the interface change over time, as this leads to buttons not appearing in consistent locations, which is counter-intuitive.</p>\n<p>3) I don't understand why you believe keyboard shortcuts would not be relevant/useful for new users? I don't view keyboard shortcuts in any program as being an advanced feature.</p>\n<p>4) I do agree that it would be better to use a larger font size. At the moment, I'm not sure how to address this without relegating some of the options to a sub-menu; there is a trade-off here between discoverability and readability. However, perhaps it would be worth the trade-off to move some of the less common buttons. I'll have a think about it.</p>\n<p>5 &amp; 6) I agree. I've been meaning to write a tutorial to explain how these features work, as they are a little difficult to discover, but as ever there are always other things that end up taking priority. I will try to get to this soon.</p>\n<p>7) I'll experiment with modifying the text.</p>\n<p>Suggestion) This would conflict with the current behaviour to deselect objects/arrows.</p>\n<p>8 &amp; 9) Do you have a suggestion for what might help: perhaps adding something like \"Label:\"/\"Colour:\" to the left of each input?</p>\n<p>10) I don't understand why you believe that the action to delete something should be the same as the action to create something?  I don't think I can think of a single example in software where this is the case. Using backspace or delete for deletion is essentially universal.</p>\n<p>12) Could you explain why you think this? Certainly there is user familiarity with the default browser effect to denote selection, but the blue highlight effect is used consistently in <strong>quiver</strong> and is very visible.</p>\n<p>13) The input field is in the same place for arrows as for objects, and it's hard to ignore the side panel with arrow styles. Could you say how long it took you to understand how to modify arrow labels/styles?</p>\n<p>14) Could you clarify what you mean by \"overwhelming\"? This seems a very strong reaction to having a panel with quite a few options. It doesn't take more than a few minutes to play around with the options to see what they do.</p>\n<p>15 &amp; 21) Probably it would be a good idea to increase the contrast, yes. I shall play around with this.</p>\n<p>16) To clarify, could you say approximately how long it took you? Did you spot the selected arrow changing as you clicked the buttons, or not? It's helpful for me to understand how other people discover <strong>quiver</strong>. The design definitely assumes some experimentation on the side of the user, but my hope was that it was fairly clear what most of the options do by looking at how they affect the selected arrow.</p>\n<p>17) I can see your point about the grid pattern. It would be possible to add collapsible sections, but I would not want to make anything collapsed by default, because I feel this harms discoverability. And once a user has learnt what the buttons do, I feel there is little reason to collapse the sections. I'll have a think about it.</p>\n<p>18) I'll admit I wasn't sure the best word to use for this option. I don't think \"Level\" is ideal. I'm not convinced by \"Lines\" either, though, because arrows typically involve more lines than just the \"body\" lines, so I think this is misleading.</p>\n<p>19) I do think it would help to separate the options affecting the label from the options affecting the arrow itself. This is one of the aspects I plan to revisit in the future (especially with multiple labels per arrow).</p>\n<p>20) ARIA labels could be a good idea, though I would be very happy to hear from someone who uses a screen reader or relies on such accessibility features. I suspect <strong>quiver</strong> is not accessible at all for this use case, in which case ARIA labels are essentially irrelevant.</p>\n<p>22) It would be helpful to add information about this to <strong>quiver</strong> itself, I agree. For now, it's explained <a href=\"https://github.com/varkor/quiver/\">on the GitHub page</a>.</p>\n<p>23) I would be happy to merge a pull request for dark mode if anyone wanted to submit one.</p>\n<p>24) This is certainly true, but it is a lot of work to make a commutative diagram editor work on a small screen, and an extremely small proportion of users will wish to do so. I don't see that there are many use cases. I don't think this is worth the time investment, but I would be happy to merge a pull request if someone felt differently.</p>",
