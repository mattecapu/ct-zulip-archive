        "content": "<p>The most intuitive explanation of an equivalence of categories that I've seen (for me) was \"A functor F : A → B is called an equivalence provided that it is full, faithful, and isomorphism-dense in the sense that for any B-object B there exists some A-object A such that F (A) is isomorphic to B.\" (from \"Abstract and Concrete Categories\").<br>\nThe mental picture I get is that the category B has all the objects of A in it (up to isomorphism), and they are related as they are in A, but we've also potentially got some extra objects. However, these extra objects are just isomorphic to ones from A and so they don't really add anything new.<br>\nAlong these lines, maybe one can cook up some simple example by endowing objects with some extra property that is ignored by morphisms? For example, one could colour sets (every element is red or blue), but not require functions to respect colourings. Then any two sets with the same number of elements would still be isomorphic (even if they have different colourings). It seems intuitively to me like this might give a category equivalent to <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"sans-serif\">S</mi><mi mathvariant=\"sans-serif\">e</mi><mi mathvariant=\"sans-serif\">t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathsf{Set}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6944em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathsf\">Set</span></span></span></span></span>.<br>\nI don't know if this sort of thing would make a good example. I'm just trying to present an intuition that makes sense for me, and might make sense to your audience - the idea that two equivalent categories have essentially all the same things, but some extra copies of those same things might exist in one of them.</p>",
