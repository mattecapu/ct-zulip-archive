The first is the thing defined at <a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/twisting%20cochain\">https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/twisting%20cochain</a> ; the second is the thing defined by Toledo–Tong (I'll attach an image because I'm too lazy at the moment to type out the definition) (but the definition can also be found in eg the slides from a talk I gave, linked further down); and the third is the thing defined by Bondal–Kapranov (<a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/twisted+complex\">https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/twisted+complex</a>). </p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/2ZaodSplxvD9iaNgvO8eGhr0/Screenshot-2021-05-09-at-16.27.19.png\">Screenshot-2021-05-09-at-16.27.19.png</a> </p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/2ZaodSplxvD9iaNgvO8eGhr0/Screenshot-2021-05-09-at-16.27.19.png\" title=\"Screenshot-2021-05-09-at-16.27.19.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/21317/2ZaodSplxvD9iaNgvO8eGhr0/Screenshot-2021-05-09-at-16.27.19.png\"></a></div><p>Somehow these three should all be either equivalent or specific examples of one another. Damien Calaque bestowed upon me a beautiful explanation of how twisting cochains (in the sense of Toledo–Tong) are (strictly) specific examples of twisted complexes, and so this is written down in my thesis, but I don't know how common it is as folklore. I'm interested in this other definition, which I've never really studied before. Is it a generalisation of the Bondal–Kapranov one, or is it a strictly different generalisation of the Toledo–Tong one?</p>",
