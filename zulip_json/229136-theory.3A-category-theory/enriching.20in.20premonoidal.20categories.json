However, then I thought about how that manifests in the 1-category world where associativity is just a property, and I think that while one of the sides of the pentagon comes from sliding parallel boxes past each other, the other four sides are all true in the premonoidal setting (assuming 3-morphism associativity holds), and thus all five vertices are still just equal.</p>",

Anyway, he and Sophie Libkind just recently <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08373\">claimed</a> they have this Kleisli category monoidal but they noticed a gap (which will be updated on ArXiv soon) and so that brought up the question. </p>\n<p>I guess a much shorter and possibly more useful answer is that the motivating examples are Kleisli categories of non-monoidal monads on monoidal categories.</p>",

Virtualization in the first place can be partly motivated by non-associativity of composition, as in the case of double profunctors. I like this motivation better than missing colimits to define the compositions, personally. And then if we’re going to allow for non-associative composites of loose morphisms in that way, it seems quite natural to loosen up associativity composites of cells at the same time.
