I have seen it claimed in various places but cannot figure out what is the right reference for this. It is fairly intuitive visually but I am wondering if there is a careful algebraic proof somewhereâ€¦ I posted the question on MathOverflow too: <a href=\"https://mathoverflow.net/questions/391382/braided-monoidal-categories-as-doubly-degenerate-tricategories\">https://mathoverflow.net/questions/391382/braided-monoidal-categories-as-doubly-degenerate-tricategories</a></p>",
