It was interesting to discover that the strongly cocompact topological spaces coincide with the finite discrete spaces.</p>\n<p>I find that stackexchange questions like this are a good temperature check of the status of a categorical concept. If a question gets comments like \"Cocompactness is not as useful as compactness\", it's a good sign that anyone who has come across this concept has encountered more resistance than they had motivation for looking into it further. So why did I take an interest in cocompactness? That's a <a href=\"#narrow/stream/230087-theory.3A-topos.20theory/topic/cocompactness.20contd.2E/near/219234496\">topic for another stream</a>!</p>",

The compact objects here are the finitely presentable frames. The cocompact objects in Loc then arise by duality. In this sense cocompactness is no less natural than compactness if you are studying geometrical concepts, which are arising from algebraic concepts via Stone dualities.</p>",
