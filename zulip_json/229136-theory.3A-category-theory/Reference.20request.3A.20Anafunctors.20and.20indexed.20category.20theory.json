Does anyone have any information about this?</p>",

I started looking at the email correspondence where I learned this (much of it public, on the categories mailing list in 2011) and sadly I would rather extract the mathematics than point you at the emails themselves. It was a slightly unpleasant experience, as a junior category theorist at the time. This will need a time of concentration to summarise in an appropriate way. I should probably write a blog post.
