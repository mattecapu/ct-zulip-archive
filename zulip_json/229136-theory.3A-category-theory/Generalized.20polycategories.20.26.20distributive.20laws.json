        "content": "<p>The paper \"A unified framework for generalized multicategories\" has at its heart the construction of the horizontal kleisli virtual double category of a monad on a virtual double category; generalized multicategories are monoids in a horizontal kleisli double category on a virtual equipment satisfying a condition (that they're normalized). Another paper \"Polycategories via pseudo-distributive laws\" defines a certain type of generalized polycategory (ordinary and symmetric ones) using a kleisli bicategory construction, but this time it's a two sided kleisli category relative to a distributive law of a comonad over a monad. In fact the situation is even more particular: we have a monad on the vertical bicategory of an equipment and by taking companions &amp; conjoints we get both a monad and a comonad on the horizontal bicategory. </p>\n<p>Because I vaguely knew about this polycategory paper I had thought the construction of the horizontal kleisli category in the Crutwell-Shulman paper would generalize easily to a 2 sided kleisli category relative to a distributive law of a comonad over a monad. But I just tried to work out the details and it seems like it breaks down horribly, the arrows for the comonad point in the wrong direction for us to define 2-cells analogous to how we do it for just a monad. However it does seem like (I haven't checked this carefully) the construction goes through for the horizontal kleisli category of a monad distributing over another monad. But this is kinda strange, since (1) for an ordinary category we need a comonad in the domain and a monad in the codomain to define the 2-sided kleisli category and (2) the Garner paper uses both a comonad and a monad. Maybe (1) is a red herring in that we've already given up on having a composition law in a virtual double category and that's where the requirement comes from. But (2) is still confusing to me. Maybe the way the comonad arises, ie by taking a monad and taking conjoints of its structure maps, means we're not \"really\" working with a comonad at all? I'm not sure.</p>\n<p>If anyone has thought about this or has thoughts on it I'd love to hear</p>",

        "content": "<p>What you want for a virtual-double-categorical version of generalized polycategories is a \"horizontal\" distributive law relating two <em>vertical</em> monads.  As you noted, in an equipment a vertical monad induces both a horizontal monad and a horizontal comonad, and in Richard's construction he's taken the horizontal monad induced by one of the vertical monads and the horizontal comonad induced by the other one.  I guess this is what you need to do if you want to work purely at the bicategorical level, but at the double-categorical level the natural thing is to have two monads.  The subtle bit though is that the distributive law is <em>horizontal</em> although the monads are vertical; this is the modification that allows you to define a two-sided Kleisli double category.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Specifically I was wondering if there are examples that do not fit into this framework (appropriately categorified to handle higher structures, I guess). Eg can we make sense of something like a double category but where the basic cell shape is a hexagon, with three sorts of 1-cells? It seems like this notion of generalized multi/polycategory relative to a distributive law does capture anything where cells have an input and an output and the shape of the inputs/outputs is a reasonably behaved container. But I guess I feel a generalized category should have cells of various dimensions and those cells should have boundaries that are equipped with a partition which for globular things is a partition into an input and an output but eg in double categories the boundary of a 2-cell is a square, with the boundary partitioned into two noncontiguous pairs of 1-cells that all line up correctly</p>",
