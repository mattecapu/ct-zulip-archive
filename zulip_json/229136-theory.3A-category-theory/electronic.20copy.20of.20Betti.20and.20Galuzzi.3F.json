        "content": "<p>I'm looking for a copy of</p>\n<p>Renato Betti and Massimo Galuzzi. Categorie normate. Boll. Un. Mat. Ital. (4), 11(1):66–75, 1975.</p>\n<p>I believe the journal abbreviation is for Bollettino dell'Unione Matematica Italiana. My library claims to have a physical copy, but they need to fetch it from off-campus and I am impatient :) Many back-copies are available from the union itself  <a href=\"http://www.bdim.eu/item?id=BUMI\">here</a>, but unfortunately there's a gap between 1968-1997. It appears to be the same set of issues available on <a href=\"https://eudml.org/journal/10000\">EuDML</a>. The <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/journal/40574/volumes-and-issues\">Springer website</a> only has issues since 2014. My other favorite sources are failing me too.</p>\n<p>The paper was cited by <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01453\">Neeman</a> and purportedly contains a fuller discussion of \"normed categories\", which were alluded to by <a href=\"http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/1/tr1abs.html\">Lawvere</a> but are less well-known than the <a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/metric+space\">Lawvere metric spaces</a> which Lawvere discussed more fully (and famously) in the same paper. A normed category has a set of morphisms for each pair of objects and additionally each morphism is assigned a <em>length</em>  (a real number) subject to some axioms. I'm interested in seeing these ideas fleshed out, hopefully in a way complementary to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10189\">Kubis</a>.</p>",
