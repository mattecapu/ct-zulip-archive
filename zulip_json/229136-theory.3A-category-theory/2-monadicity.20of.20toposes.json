I supposedly know this is true (and the nLab agrees) but the BPS 2-monads paper doesn't have it; they just have monadicity of the 1-category and 2-monadicity of the 2-category over <em>groupoids</em>, which is a common cheat for structures that involve some contravariant operations. I'm interested both in a reference and in some general lore if, say, it's actually easy now to upgrade the 1-monadicity result to 2-monadicity.</p>",
