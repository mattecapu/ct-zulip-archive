This sounds neat, but... how does one do it? We need a choice of colimit for each diagram indexed by a category in C, and closing once doesn't seem like it will do the trick, unless we first extend C to its saturation (in the sense of a maximal class of colimits admitted by any category with colimits in C); indeed, as soon as we have to do this in more than one step, the existence of a choice for the colimits is no longer evident.</p>",
