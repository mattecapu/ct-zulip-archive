For example, you cannot talk about <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">S</mi><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">e</mi><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\"> \\mathbf{Set} </annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6861em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathbf\">Set</span></span></span></span></span>, and so presheaf categories are out of reach as well.</p>",
