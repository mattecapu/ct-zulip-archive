We show that for categories of sets with additional<br>\n  structure (which we define quite formally below) it is not even <br>\n  necessary to change the category: The same category has a different<br>\n  (but isomorphic) tensor product, with which it is a strict<br>\n  monoidal category. The result applies to ordinary (bi)modules,<br>\n  where it shows that one can choose a realization of the tensor <br>\n  product for each pair of modules in such a way that tensor <br>\n  products are strictly associative. Perhaps more surprisingly,<br>\n  the result also applies to such nontrivially nonstrict<br>\n  categories as the category of modules over a quasibialgebra.</p>\n</blockquote>",
