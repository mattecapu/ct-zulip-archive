Actions of monoidal categories seem to have received plenty of attention, which makes searching difficult. I came across a paper of H.E. Porst from 1987 but it's paywalled. Has anyone seen something along these lines, even for slightly specialized cases (eg. groups instead of monoids, or cartesian monoidal categories)?</p>",
