So it could either be an endomorphism of (in Coq notation) <code>ECat@{i j k}</code> with extra constraints <code>k &lt;= j &lt;= i</code>, or it could take input in <code>ECat@{i j k}</code> and yield output in <code>ECat@{max(i,j) max(j,k) k}</code>.</p>\n<p>I suppose I would argue that one should always impose the constraint <code>k &lt;= j &lt;= i</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hmm, I now have serious doubts about the latter. Let's just consider <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> for objects and homs (locally).</p>\n<ol>\n<li>for 1-object categories, we can take <code>i</code> to be 0, and <code>j</code> can be as large as we want</li>\n<li>we can also have discrete categories, with <code>i</code> as large as one wants, and <code>j</code> can be 0.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So it appears to me that they really ought to be completely independent from each other.</p>",
