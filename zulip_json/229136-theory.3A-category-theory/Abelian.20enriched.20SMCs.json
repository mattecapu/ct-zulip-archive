Taking a cue from Wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_category], this would seem to make <strong>C</strong>  a \"preadditive SMC\". This terminology is direct enough as it goes, but these categories seem to have a nice enough structure (seemingly an example of a category of R-modules) that perhaps it has a pithier name or a nice characterisation. Is there standard terminology / a standard result which can be used to describe such SMCs?</p>",
