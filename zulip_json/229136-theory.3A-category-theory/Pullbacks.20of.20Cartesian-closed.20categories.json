If A and B are Cartesian-closed, I was wondering if the pullback is also Cartesian-closed.</p>\n<p>One problem I immediately ran into when trying to prove this was that the pullback is too strict and it's better to work with weak pullbacks to avoid issues with equality when you only have isomorphisms.</p>\n<p>However, I haven't been able to make any progress. Can't think of an obvious counterexample either.</p>\n<p>I'm particularly interested in the pullback of Pos (partially ordered sets and monotone functions) and Conv (convergence spaces and continuous functions) with respect to the forgetful functors into Set. Both of them are Cartesian-closed and I feel that the pullback (call it PosConv, which consists of partially ordered convergence spaces and monotone continuous maps), should also be Cartesian closed.</p>",

For instance, for any categories A and B, consider X = A + B and U and V be the two canonical inclusions, which are faithful. Then, the pullback is going to be empty, and also the version of the pullback where you take isomorphisms instead of equalities.</p>",
