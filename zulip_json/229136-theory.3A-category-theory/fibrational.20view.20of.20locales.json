        "content": "<p>I've been thinking recently about how the \"fundamental theorem of topos theory\" looks from the POV of locales. Suppose L is a locale. Then we can show that for any a ∈ L that the downset ↓ a forms a locale also. Moreover, if we have a ≤ b then we get a geometric morphism ↓ a -&gt; ↓ b where the pullback is described by just taking the meet with a. One way to package up that information is to say something like: The codomain fibration is \"localic\" (made up terminology) meaning that the fibers are locales and cartesian maps preserve the structure. I am wondering if there is any way to make this picture 2-categorical on the entire category of Locales in the sense that we have a fibration associated to each locale but I am unsure if we can say something about that structure when we add locale morphisms.</p>",
