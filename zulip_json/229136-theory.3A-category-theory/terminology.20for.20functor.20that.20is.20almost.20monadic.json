Unfortunately, it appears that <em>functors of descent type</em> have come to mean <em>premonadic functors</em> and <em>functors of effective descent type</em> have come to mean <em>monadic functors</em>, including the left adjoint condition, in the categorical literature. For one example, see Kelly–Power's <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022404993900928\">Adjunctions whose counits are coequalizers, and presentations of finitary enriched monads</a>, but I found many more papers using the same convention (in Berger's <a href=\"http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/VIGRE/VIGRE2011/REUPapers/Berger.pdf\">On some aspects of the theory of monads</a>, both terms appear explicitly).</p>",
