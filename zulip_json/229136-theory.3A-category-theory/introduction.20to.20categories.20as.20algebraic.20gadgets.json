When introducing category theory, I don't want my readers to think at all about size issues in the set-theoretic sense.   But I do want to point out the difference between using a category as a context in which you study objects of some sort, versus treating a category itself as the object of study.    This distinction is psychologically important to beginners.   Too many introductions to category theory focus on the first kind of example, not enough on the second.  As a result, they tend to visualize a category as a misty sort of \"background\" in which objects sit.  I want them to also be able to see a category as something like a tiny ant.</p>",

But they're really important!  So I think a good modern intro to categories has got to talk about enriched categories at some point, so readers can see a ring as a one-object Ab-enriched category.  And I think it's got to talk a bit about locales, so readers can learn to think of topology not in terms of a set of points with a topology has slapped on, but rather a poset of \"opens\".</p>",

I'm interested in the process of generating categories that are helpful for studying it. This might look like viewing the mathematical object itself as a category, but it could instead involve viewing the mathematical object as an object in some category, or as a functor between categories. This could also involve studying the relationships between similar mathematical objects, when each is modelled as an object in some category. Broadly, I'm interested in the process of producing statements in the language of category theory that tell us things about a mathematical object.</p>\n<p>One reason why I think this can be difficult is that a lot of flexibility is available. For each category we deem useful to studying a mathematical object of interest, we can produce many new categories and functors - each of which potentially provide a slightly different angle of study. Learning about examples of how people have navigated this flexibility to produce categories useful for studying the original mathematical objects would be interesting to me.</p>\n<p>Closely related to this, I'm also interested in studying the process of mathematical study, using the language of category theory. It's awesome how category theory can help us draw parallels between theorems in different categories about mathematical objects, but - for example - it would also be exciting to use it to draw parallels between strategies used for constructing or defining interesting objects. To take a particular example, there are quite a few concepts that come together to define a smooth manifold - could one tease apart the process of reasoning that puts all these concepts together, and then state it in more general category  theoretic language that could be applied in other settings?</p>",
