This said, Cauchy completion arises in a reconstruction procedure: given a small category A, inside the presheaf category [A*,Set] there is a copy of _the Cauchy completion of A_, not exactly of A. It's as if trying to recover A from its free cocompletion PA -a much bigger object!- you were forced to extract a \"dust\" made by all the absolute colimits together with the objects of A. This is partly true because of Yoneda lemma: if you can only know an object from what maps into/out of it, then there's no way to remove the dust from A: because every functor will be _at least_ absolute cocontinuous.</p>",
