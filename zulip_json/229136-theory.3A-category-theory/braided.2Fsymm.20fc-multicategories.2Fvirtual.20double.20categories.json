To define commutative monoids we need  a symmetric monoidal category, (or possibly merely a braided monoidal category). Is there a published/folklore definition of what the generalization to a braided/symmetric fc-multicategory/virtual double category should be or do I need to just work out the details myself? Seems like this would be a \"nice place to define generalized groupoids\"</p>",
