This would solve many problems, but I'm worried the switch might just move the problems somewhere else, since a lot of the definitions I use would loosen up to 'up to posetal equivalence'.<br>\nThe issue is nothing new for categorists, and actually trascends my little quid-pro-quo (which can be worked around, tbh). Many 'functors' we define are only define up to equivalence.</p>\n<p>Is anybody aware of some pitfalls of these loose definitions? The only one I can come up with is that one has to employ a lot of (possibly global!) choice to well-define stuff at the set level. But this is a merely aestethical problem, at least to me and my goals.</p>",
