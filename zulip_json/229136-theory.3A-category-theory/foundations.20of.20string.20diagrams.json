In this paper, we combine the ideas in graph theory and category theory to explain why and in what sense upward planarity is a topological property. The main result is that two upward planar drawings of an acyclic directed graph are equivalent (connected by a deformation) if and only if they are connected by a planar isotopy which preserves the orientation and polarization of G. This result gives a positive answer to Selinger's conjectue, whose strategy is different from the solution recently given by Delpeuch and Vicary. \"</p>",

I wondered about your comment; maybe you misread mine.  I know left-to-right is pretty common, it was right-to-left I was asking about (and I don't see that in Peter's article, apart from cases where a \"negation\" or \"star\" operation reverses an arrow).  Does anyone use that?  The other three (obvious) possibilities are common - but this one seems untouched (maybe for a good reason?).
