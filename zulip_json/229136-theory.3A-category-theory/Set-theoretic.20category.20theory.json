There are lots of important categories that aren't small; David mentioned the most obvious one, but there's also the category of groups, the category of monoids, the category of rings, the category of vector spaces, the category of topological spaces, etc. etc.   These are <a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/large%20categories\">[[large categories]]</a>.  If you accidentally defined \"category\" to mean \"small category\" you'd be leaving out all of these.  That would be quite unfortunate.</p>",
