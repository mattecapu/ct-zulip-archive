In particular I don't think that the von Neumann naturals are literally the natural numbers. Moreover, if I adopt the philosophical stance that mathematics is actually 'about real-world computation' (which, to me, seems relatively common among constructive type theorists), then I don't really see how to maintain the idea that there should be a unique natural numbers object. Real-world computation is fundamentally untyped and at a base level one always needs to choose an encoding of something like the natural numbers. One can clearly implement computational systems that attempt to get around this, such as cubical type theory, but this is clearly a high-level conceptual framework being imposed on real-world computation, as evidenced by the high computational complexity of things like Cubical Agda.</p>\n<p>That said, I also don't think it's all that incoherent for a Platonist to literally identify the von Neumann ordinals with the ordinals the way set theorists often do. The von Neumann ordinals have exact structural parity with the ordinals; they don't have any extraneous coding structure the way things like coding the integers as pairs of natural do. As a corollary of this, I also don't think it's incoherent to literally identify the finite <em>ordinals</em> with the finite von Neumann ordinals. Obviously the finite ordinals are a natural numbers object, but depending on how one defines 'finite ordinal,' this is a very slightly non-trivial fact. There's clearly different intensionality between the definitions of the finite ordinal numbers and the finite cardinal numbers.</p>\n<p>In any case, I also don't think book HoTT entirely succeeds at the structuralist philosophy. As far as I can tell, book HoTT doesn't have universe subtyping. This means that it suffers from the same 'hall of mirrors' effect that Russell originally identified as an unsatisfactory aspect of Principia Mathematica. Each type-theoretic universe has its own copy of the natural numbers, the Dedekind real numbers, etc. <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"double-struck\">N</mi><mo>:</mo><msub><mi mathvariant=\"script\">U</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathbb{N}\\mathrel{:}\\mathcal{U}_0</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6889em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathbb\">N</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\"><span class=\"mrel\">:</span></span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8333em;vertical-align:-0.15em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathcal\" style=\"margin-right:0.09931em;\">U</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t vlist-t2\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.3011em;\"><span style=\"top:-2.55em;margin-left:-0.0993em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\">0</span></span></span></span><span class=\"vlist-s\">​</span></span><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.15em;\"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> and <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"double-struck\">N</mi><mo>:</mo><msub><mi mathvariant=\"script\">U</mi><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathbb{N}\\mathrel{:}\\mathcal{U}_1</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6889em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathbb\">N</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\"><span class=\"mrel\">:</span></span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8333em;vertical-align:-0.15em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathcal\" style=\"margin-right:0.09931em;\">U</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t vlist-t2\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.3011em;\"><span style=\"top:-2.55em;margin-left:-0.0993em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\">1</span></span></span></span><span class=\"vlist-s\">​</span></span><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.15em;\"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> are obviously 'morally' isomorphic as objects, but in the context of book HoTT saying that these two objects are 'equal' <em>isn't even a meaningful statement</em>.</p>",

library <a href=\"https://github.com/coq-community/autosubst\">Autosubst</a>. In this library, they literally identify their variable symbols with natural numbers:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Coq\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"c\">(** A type synonym for natural numbers used as de Bruijn indices *)</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">Definition</span> <span class=\"n\">var</span> <span class=\"o\">:=</span> <span class=\"n\">nat</span><span class=\"o\">.</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>This means that it's meaningful to take the factorial of a variable or ask whether a variable is a prime in the context of this library, for instance. Is this actually a problem? No of course not. Moreover, I'm sure that the developers of Autosubst chose to do this to avoid needing to obnoxiously cast naturals to variables all the time. But I feel like this speaks to a broader point which is that a certain amount of junk behavior in a system is sometimes not really a problem and trying to eradicate it <em>entirely</em> isn't even necessarily practical.</p>",

The phrase 'In some cases' and the word 'simply' are doing an incredible amount of work here. As a bit of probably unwanted advice, I'd say that if you really want to convince mainstream mathematicians that they should be interested in HoTT, you should probably deemphasize constructivity. I've met people who <em>like higher category theory</em> but who aren't interested in HoTT because they're under the impression that it's necessarily constructive. And while the HoTT book itself emphasizes that constructivity isn't obligatory, I've also met HoTT people online who insist on statements like 'univalence is incompatible with LEM,' which while true under some readings (specifically interpreting 'LEM' as type-level LEM) is also really misleading (since type-level LEM already implies global choice without univalence, and this is really not what most people mean by 'LEM').</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>and in (iv) the difference is that the HIIT construction does not require first constructing the Dedekind reals, and in particular also works predicatively.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The problem I still have with this is that the Cauchy real construction in the book isn't really using the full power of higher inductive types. It's just a quotient inductive type. Quotient inductive types are compatible with set theory, and moreover it seems reasonable to me that something like CZF + \"quotient inductive types exist\" would be predicative.</p>\n<p>Similarly, a friend of mine pointed out to me that CZF with the regular extension axiom can probably also construct the HoTT Cauchy reals. I think some people might not consider REA predicative, but CZF + REA is still a really weak theory as far as these things go.</p>\n<p>Rathjen and Lubarsky's paper on the regular extension axiom came out in 2003, about ten years before the HoTT book. Did any of the authors of the HoTT book talk to any constructive/predicative set theorists (like Rathjen or Lubarsky) about whether this construction could be done in previously studied constructive set theories (since you said this section is about constructivity, not about predicativity)? Or did the person that wrote this just <em>assume</em> that it couldn't be done the same way someone seemingly just <em>assumed</em> that there's no such thing as a predicative set theory with a proof-theoretic consistency proof?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>it says that set-theoretic axioms <em>can</em> be chosen arbitrarily.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No they can't. They still need to be <em>consistent</em>.

Note the word 'requires.'</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yes, I think it is.  The difference is not in the state of \"we hope/expect X but are not sure about it yet\" but in the difference between the notion of consistency and the notion of computability.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My point is that saying something can be done 'arbitrarily' is pretty strong. I don't think it's really an accurate description of the process of trying to dream up a set theory in practice, and I don't think that process is <em>that</em> different from trying to write down a semantically motivated but also computational type theory, like book HoTT.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yes, that's why I said \"sans axioms\".  My understanding is that these proof assistants are built on a type-theoretic core that is constructive and hence implementable, with classical properties added on top as axioms.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Honestly I have the most experience with Isabelle/HOL at this point, and I don't know how much of the computational content of the ambient constructive type theory really comes through to the end user. It seems like most of the handling of stuff like purely computational equality is done by high-level tactics like <code>auto</code> and <code>simp</code> and by the ATPs integrated via Sledgehammer. We would need someone more familiar with the bowels of Isabelle/HOL to be sure about this, but part of my evidence is that libraries written by the devs themselves, like HOL-Algebra, use Hilbert choice operators pretty freely in basic definitions (such as the inverse function in a group), and choice operators in Isabelle/HOL explicitly don't have computational rules. Another piece of evidence is just that the ATPs Sledgehammer calls are all purely classical and are mostly based on stuff like superposition calculus, which can <em>only</em> prove things by contradiction.</p>\n<p>In general this is something that I don't find convincing in the rhetoric of some type theorists (the idea that the computational content of constructive type theory is <em>necessary</em> for a practical proof assistant). I think that a proof assistant built on purely classical logic with good tactics and ATP integration could probably be about as usable as something like Coq or Lean. The problem in my mind is that developing good tactics is the kind of thing that cost the kind of money that a lot of people who might try to build alternative proof assistants don't have.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It wasn't intended to be.  It was intended as a description of the amount of computation needed in to be able to implement a set theory (even a classical one).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ah, I was misunderstanding then.</p>",

I shouldn't have used the term 'bad faith' for instance. But I do think that even the issues you posted to the HoTT book GitHub page as a result of this argument highlight a lack of academic due diligence when it comes to some of the offhand remarks about set theory in the book. Nearly one single page (the end of page 13 together with page 14 of <code>hott-ebook-13-g2e736d1.pdf</code>) of the introduction contains several errors.</p>\n<p>Returning to what you said here for a moment.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These four numbered points are <em>not</em> \"comparing HoTT to set theory\" in a general way. They are in the section of the introduction about constructivity, and are introduced with the following paragraph:<br>\n[...]<br>\nIn other words, the sole purpose of these numbered points is to argue that <em>constructive</em> HoTT is easier, or more elegant, than constructive set theory, for a mathematician coming from a classical background.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don't buy this as precise explanation of what that section is doing rhetorically; I don't think that's what it's 'solely' doing. The 'circumlocutions' quote in (iii) only really makes sense in the context of <em>classical</em> set theory given that it explicitly talks about cardinality. Both initial cardinals and Scott cardinals don't even work in IZF. (Likewise, when I challenged you on this particular point earlier, you insisted on talking about cardinals rather than ordinals, since cardinals are clearly handled in a more inelegant way in set theory.) This means that in point (iii) at least, the comparison is really more correctly seen as between <em>classical</em> set theory and constructive type theory, not between <em>constructive</em> set theory and constructive type theory. The HoTT book could have made the point here that constructive set theory doesn't seem to be even able to define canonical representatives of cardinalities at all—no locution at all is certainly worse than circumlocution—but it didn't. With no comment about the status of cardinals in constructive set theory from the book, how are we to know that we cannot, 'simply by rephrasing some definitions,' perhaps find a far more elegant description of cardinals in constructive set theory?</p>\n<p>This makes we wonder again about my direct question from earlier, which you did not address:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Did any of the authors of the HoTT book talk to any constructive/predicative set theorists (like Rathjen or Lubarsky) about whether this construction could be done in previously studied constructive set theories (since you said this section is about constructivity, not about predicativity)?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Moving on, I think that point (iv) and the comment about consistency strength are not only both incorrect, but are also somewhat mutually incompatible. IZF can prove the existence of free Cauchy sequence completions of metric spaces and IZF with collection (and therefore of course ZFC) can actually implement the HoTT definition somewhat directly without explicitly relying on embedding into the Cauchy filter completion of the space (although it does not result in a uniquely defined set). In IZF with a designated inaccessible set (satisfying second-order collection), the construction can be done directly and canonically. (I think you would find the second construction ugly to be sure, but the current wording in the book makes it sound like such a feat is literally impossible.) As you pointed out, these seemingly require impredicativity and IZF with collection and/or univereses are pretty strong constructive set theories, so if we require predicativity then yes the idea of higher inductive types yields something new in this context (and that is a valuable insight), but the comment about consistency strength only makes sense if we assume that all set theories are too strong to be predicative.</p>\n<p>So, yes, I do feel comfortable saying that this quote</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Moreover, in univalent foundations this seems to happen more often. For instance:<br>\n[...]<br>\n(iv) In set-theoretic foundations, the definition of the real numbers as equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences requires either the law of excluded middle or the axiom of (countable) choice to be well-behaved. But with higher inductive types, we can give a version of this definition which is well-behaved and avoids any choice principles; see Chapter 11.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>is disingenuous in effect. The phrase 'version of this definition' is vague. It does not make it clear at all that it is actually an inequivalent definition which, moreover, <em>also works in some constructive set theories</em> (drastically contrasting the implication of the previous sentence, which is that in set theory one \"requires\" LEM or countable choice to make a Cauchy sequence definition of the reals work well). There's nothing uniquely set-theoretic about the naive definition of Cauchy reals (after all, it's fairly trivial to write down in HoTT), and there's nothing fundamentally univalent about the free completion definition, especially if the regime of set theories in which this distinction starts to matter most (weak, predicative theories) is implicitly excluded by a comment later on in the same page anyway.</p>",

It was all well and good for Mac Lane to argue with whoever about whether category theory was worthless, having invented it as a rather senior mathematician! The Duskonian attitude only really works if you assume that the arc of academic hiring inevitably bends toward truth (ideally on the timespan of a single career), whereas I think I’m probably not alone on this server in perceiving that category theorists have actually been unfairly underhired, especially in the land of category theory’s birth, for the whole life of the subject, and at least partly as a result of all the constant negative muttering about abstract nonsense. The fact that category theory is now providing a fair number of jobs at private institutes and startups is, if anything, just proof that academic hiring committees have been opposed to category theory for political reasons more than intellectual ones, for generations. I imagine James is feeling similar things when people are excessively negative about set theory.</p>",

Over the last three decades or more, Foundations research in general has not been popular among experts in these key areas, and trying to attributing this to disputes within the foundation fields seems dubious at best.</p>\n<p>After all, a few foundational fields have successfully countered this unfavorable view, and they could only do so by doing things that the core areas found immediately valuable. E.g. the classical model theorists settled relative Mordell-Lang, provided explicit bounds on the density of rational points on transcendental curves, proved a bunch of new graph regularity lemmas, etc. They provided tools that the practitioners of the core fields could and did use frequently: and indeed, combinatorialists and number theorists now hire classical model theorists with some frequency, and care little whether other logicians namecall them or not. Pure category theory has not (maybe could not) make a concentrated effort like that. This does not decrease the worth of category theory and category theorists: I don't think a field's worth should be measured by how many number theory conjectures it settles! But it does explain the hiring gap adequately.</p>\n<p>I don't think any department every hired based on \"diversity of fields\" principle. Quite the opposite. Sure, if a department suddenly lacks expertise in a core area (like having no analysis experts at all), they might hire to fill that void, but usually, they prefer candidates who are already known collaborators, or are expected to become collaborators very quickly. If nobody in a department ever has use for results from Hodge Theory, they won't hire a Hodge Theorist, because there will always be other applicants who fit the department better and could be immediate collaborators, coauthors on grants, etc. This is true even though Hodge Theory is highly regarded among pure mathematicians and is not associated with any negative stereotypes.</p>\n<p>It seems improbable that a department dominated by, idk, stable homotopy theorists would dismiss hiring a category theorist because they consider categories abstract nonsense. However, \"this particular category theorist doesn't do the kind of category theory that helps with our work stable homotopy theory\" is much more likely to come up, and one has to admit, is a perfectly valid observation, and not a \"political reason\".</p>\n<p>In the end, they'll probably hire a candidate some people in the department already know in some respect. This pattern holds across all fields: familiar candidates are favored over outsiders, unless filling a very glaring gap is necessary. And for better or worse, most departments are dominated by people from the core areas, who do not use category theory, or any kind of foundations research. By itself, this does not even imply bias; after all, they same people are often eager to jump on new tools if they think it'd help with their work. But even if there is bias, it's certainly not caused by academic conflicts within foundations.</p>\n<p>There could be evidence that would change my mind -- it would involve examples of math departments that are dominated by foundations, but for mysterious reasons refuse to hire from certain areas. In those situations, intra-foundations conflict would look like the most plausible culprit. E.g. if Leeds had no category theorists at all, I'd certainly be alarmed. But that's not what I see: despite all conflicts, reverse mathematicians, proof theorists, category theorists, set theorists, model theorists seem to all flock together whenever the opportunity to do so arises.</p>\n<p>Moreover, while category theory has found applications in the private sector, this also doesn't show that there was bias against it in academia.</p>\n<p>One could compare with automata theorists. It was not easy and is still not easy to get a job as an automata theorist in a CS department (it's impossible to get one in a math department).</p>\n<p>But Amazon hired automata theorists in large numbers in Cambridge. Alexa's ability to understand human speech, a decade before LLMs, was largely a result of their work. It's a remarkable achievement. Is this evidence that automata theorists were underhired?</p>\n<p>Absolutely not. The research that contributed to Alexa</p>\n<p>a.) required the scientists to command a very large number of subordinate research engineers to make this a reality; far larger than any academic department would be willing or able to hire (and even if they were willing, research engineers like to work for research engineer salaries, way above academic pay tables).<br>\nb.) had enormous impact, but produced very little content suitable for academic publication, far less than targeted foundational research would (and at far higher cost!). Alexandra Silva's academic output alone far exceeds anything that came out of Amazon's large team.<br>\nc.) was not feasible within an academic setting. Even if Amazon had the inclination to fund the same researchers while they still worked in academia, the resources required to do this far exceed anything managable via Standard Innovation Vouchers or other industry grants/gifts. And that's before noting that academic overheads are massive (50+%!) and these positions do not allow researchers to focus solely on research due to other academic duties like administration, occasional teaching, and supervision.</p>\n<p>All in all, this sort of application is not right for academic settings, and it would be very difficult to argue that computer science departments significantly missed out by not hiring more automata theorists, especially compared to possibly hiring fewer experts in fields like security, databases, or programming languages.</p>\n<p>The ambitious industrial applications of category theory also require substantial investment (in a recent high profile case $30mil+), large teams of engineers, and will yield limited academic publications over an extended period. So while category theory has found applications in industry, I don't find this convincing evidence that math academia is somehow biased against it.</p>\n<p>(I'm coming from a place of experience w.r.t. industrial research: the work we did at CSIRO for Hensoldt and Boeing was more impactful than my academic work. But it also yielded a grand total of 0 publications. Even if I could have found a university that tolerated me producing no publications for 3 years while also not doing any teaching or admin whatsoever, they would not tolerate me also hiring a research assistant and a bunch of students to help me, who also produce no publications in the same time period)</p>",

To be clear, I didn't mean at all that <em>intra-foundations</em> arguments have led to low academic hiring of category theorists. I mean instead to point to an attitude of mathematicians in the \"core\" fields looking down on the area. So, this might be off topic and I'll try to constrain myself to one more reply. </p>\n<p>Anyway, it's impossible to definitively settle this kind of question, but I remain quite convinced that the fact that category theory has had a continuous advance in its involvement in and relevance to, first, such prototypically core fields as algebraic geometry and topology, and later to nearly every part of pure math, and more recently to applied fields, all the while with the overwhelming majority of departments not so much as offering a course in the field, let alone employing a specialist, is substantially a result of bias. One of the most important books of the century so far for topology is literally called <em>Higher Topos Theory</em>, but it was written by someone who was not trained by category theorists, does not describe himself as a category theorist, and is not conceptualized by the community as a category theorist; the most famous mathematician of my generation is engaged in a program of finally invading analytic geometry with category theory; of the leading category theorists in the US, I can think of exactly one who is tenured at a math department of an R1 university (though I have no reason to believe Mike couldn't get such a job if he wanted to.) At the Topos Institute we've thus far been able to support ourselves doing work that continuously produces public academic outputs with no mass employment of engineers whatsoever, entirely on grant money, making us an example I think is pretty much unique among mathematical research institutes using tools traditionally identified with pure math. There is no bound to the amount of evidence one can prefer to explain away, but I would be completely at a loss to name another field of math with such a combination of usefulness to other fields both pure and applied and an almost absolute lack of hiring into the most traditionally desirable postiions.</p>",

Indeed I use some of the software maintained by Evan et al. there, and follow the tons of great logic research coming out of there. I think all of it is certainly <em>R1 department quality</em> or above! However, I don't think much or any of it concerns the <em>topics</em> associated with R1 departments.</p>\n<p>And landing a job in an R1 department, or any academic department for that matter, depends on previous collaboration with people from those departments on their specific research topics. This approach seems entirely appropriate and unbiased to me, even if it means that departments' topics change extremely slowly, and thus the fields represented at R1 institutions change very slowly.</p>\n<p>You write:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is no bound to the amount of evidence one can prefer to explain away, but I would be completely at a loss to name another field of math with such a combination of usefulness to other fields both pure and applied and an almost absolute lack of hiring into the most traditionally desirable postiions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Does a self-styled category theorist who made significant contributions to derived algebraic geometry really have a harder time getting hired than a self-styled homotopy theorist with the same contribution? While open to persuasion (perhaps in another thread?), I harbor very serious doubts. By all means, call me out if I dismiss or explain away evidence for this, but I don't remember encountering any evidence that needed to be explained!</p>\n<p>The impact of category theory on pure mathematics is clear. And departments or institutes shouldn't recruit from different fields (no matter how adjacent) when they have a lineup of familiar collaborators to recruit. The category theorists who impacted the relevant fields are presumably among those familiar collaborators, and are therefore part of the same hiring pipeline. Category theorist or not, Lurie himself certainly was, and his early, brief stint in logic did not seem to disadvantage him. The right way to change this seems to be by make contributions to R1 deparment topics, getting people into R1 departments, then once they have tenure and can branch out, they can invite the rest of the category theorists in (again, seems to have worked for model theorists). Even better is to make alternative \"most desirable positions\" and I think category theorists are doing amazing work on that at the moment!</p>\n<p>I 100% think that R1 departments should have more category theorists. And more set theorists for that matter. I just don't think the current state arose because of bias against category theory (and certainly not bias that could have been averted if we had fewer intra-foundations conflicts, which was the original point I wanted to make).</p>",

So for instance if there is a definable class equivalence relation that only has set-many equivalence classes, then there will be a rank at which you have seen inhabitants of each equivalence class. This feels to me to be very similar to the phenomenon that Friedman used to show that IZF doesn't have the existence property. My intuition about the issue is that while you can grab ranks of elements of a proper class, you can't really settle on some 'canonical' choice of 'sufficiently low' rank.</p>\n<p>In particular though, this might mean that there can be class equivalence relations in IZF with no 'Scottification' if they don't have set-many equivalence classes.</p>",

The big problem is when type theorists get caught up on computational aspects of implementing type theory as a programming language or proof assistant such as decidable judgmental equality or canonicity or normalisation. All of a sudden, axioms like propositional resizing (impredicativity), excluded middle, UIP, univalence, choice, and replacement become problematic and cannot be used or else some important computational property breaks like canonicity. </p>\n<p>This is why many type theorists are not just constructivists but also predicativists and reject the set of truth values/subobject classifier/type of all propositions as well; it has nothing to do with logic and everything to do with the axiom not interacting well with computation. It's also why type theorists spent so much time developing cubical type theory and are now developing higher observational type theory, so that they can make univalence behave well with computation. </p>\n<p>If tomorrow a dependent type theory lands on Earth which has LEM and satisfies all the desirable computational properties of a type theory such as decidable equality, canonicity, normalisation, etc, then it is very likely type theorists will be more accepting of LEM because a major roadblock for acceptance has been removed.</p>",

I said it was an explicitly stated editorial agenda, which I think is pretty hard to argue with when you have statements like 'In particular, the nLab has a particular point of view, which we may call the nPOV, the higher algebraic, homotopical, or n- categorical point of view.' and 'So at the nLab, we don’t care so much about being neutral.'</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It's just that there are things where n- and ∞-categories <em>really do help</em> and when the nLab started that approach really wasn't known or being emphasised.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm not debating that, but that's also not what the page says. The page makes some concessions to the idea that other points of views may be valid, but then it does also contain the quote I mentioned earlier.

However, the <code>Prop</code> for the universe lies in the next universe up, so is inaccessible to anybody working inside of that universe. In addition, it is impossible to prove that any two universes' <code>Prop</code> are equivalent to each other.

Classical mathematical logicians who are interested in working in weak systems (like people studying weak arithmetic or reverse mathematics) often work with systems in which full induction on the natural numbers isn't provable. In basically all but the very weakest type theories you still have full induction on the natural numbers.

Neutral constructive mathematics arose out of trying to find a common minimal basis for the main schools of constructivism at the time (Bishop's constructivism, Russian constructivism, Brouwer's constructivism, etc). All of them worked in an impredicative set theory with power sets defined in intuitionistic first-order logic, but all accepted different axioms which contradicted with each other, as well as weaker versions of the axiom of choice. It was in this atmosphere that the idea of \"neutral\" constructive mathematics developed, one which none of the weaker choice axioms or the additional axioms would hold, so the theorems in neutral constructive mathematics can be proven in all the main schools of constructivism as well as in classical mathematics. Since every single one of the relevant main constructive schools accepted impredicativity/power sets, in the end neutral constructive mathematics became synonymous with working in IZF/IBZ or in an elementary topos or in intuitionistic higher-order logic. So neutral constructive mathematics really should be called neutral <em>impredicative</em> constructive mathematics from the perspective of predicativists.</p>",

If you look at <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/0905.1680#section.7\">section 7 of \"Is set theory indispensable?\" for instance</a>, it seems like his argument that ZFC is probably not arithmetically sound is more or less 'I find it hard to believe that it is.' He also at times has made the case that while it's coherent to imagine exhaustively searching a countable collection (thus justifying classical reasoning about the naturals), it is not coherent to imagine exhaustively searching an uncountable collection. (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/0905.1677#subsection.3.2\">See section 3.2 of \"The concept of a set\" for instance.</a>) There's certainly a difference between these and a fair amount of philosophical subtlety, but I don't see where he's getting his extreme confidence in classical reasoning about the naturals and extreme distrust of classical reasoning about uncountable objects. I actually think ordinal Turing machines provide a pretty clear mental picture of <em>a</em> context in which one is in some sense mechanically searching an uncountable collection of objects, in contrast to his statement 'This is because we have no clear conception of what it would be like to look through all real numbers, or all countable ordinals, even if supertasks were allowed.'</p>",

The fact that (under the most commonly used encoding of natural numbers) 2 is an element of 3 isn't really a practical impediment to formalizing mathematics in ZFC. The only real problem with it is aesthetic, but this is sometimes presented by itself as conclusive evidence of the insufficiency of set theory for formalizing mathematics.</p>\n<p>This kind of criticism starts veering into territory that is implicitly hostile to really fundamental ideas in classical mathematical logic, like implying that things like the axiom of foundation are 'artifical.' The cumulative hierarchy is a good way of thinking about the large-scale behavior of well-foundedness. It's a good way of judging the strength of closure properties and consistency strength more generally. We saw this way back at the beginning of this conversation when I answered Mike's question about whether every set being in a Grothendieck universe is enough to imply replacement. But it's hard to accept the fact that it is useful if you're trying to maintain that it's a fundamentally 'artificial' way of thinking about sets, which seems to me to be Mike's position, for instance.</p>\n<p>I feel like it's possible to make these criticisms in a more nuanced way. In Barwise's book <em>Admissible sets and structures</em>, Barwise also complains about most of the issues Mike brought up with regards to set theory (with the notable exception of constructivity). He primarily works with KPU, a weak, predicative set theory with urelements (that don't necessarily all live in one set). He doesn't even take the axiom of infinity as a given (which makes his life harder in places, as he points out). <a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/0IUYpfaIiFBaCF7w6n5Izer8/image.png\">Near the beginning of the book he makes some pretty similar criticisms to the ones I'm talking about here.</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/0IUYpfaIiFBaCF7w6n5Izer8/image.png\" title=\"Near the beginning of the book he makes some pretty similar criticisms to the ones I'm talking about here.\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/21317/0IUYpfaIiFBaCF7w6n5Izer8/image.png\"></a></div><p>But then he also spends the entirety of a 400+ page book working with a well-founded material set theory because it <em>can actually be a useful way of organizing things</em>. He uses things like transitive closures and Mostowski collapse frequently. He spends a lot of time working with ranks of sets, despite the fact that it's an 'evil' concept that isn't easily visible in the corresponding category of sets.</p>\n<p>Obviously I can't reasonably expect people to not make off-the-cuff remarks like calling ZFC 'wacky,' but I also need to be free to criticize that kind of thing because it's often justified in really tenuous ways and because it is legitimately hostile.</p>",

That being said, when <em>using</em> a system of mathematics, not being able to express 'nonsense' statements can also be viewed as an advantage. This is like how many people prefer strongly typed programming languages even if they need to sacrifice some expressivity.

Maybe the following distinction is useful (it has probably been made before somewhere?): </p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Foundations to do mathematics <em>in</em>:  this is about the UI/UX of mathematics, about the correspondence between formalism and concepts. Does the formalism reflect well how we do mathematics in practice? How suitable is the formalism for the computer implementation of mathematics in a proof assistant? What concepts can the formalism <em>conveniently/natively</em> express (e.g. univalence/structuralism in HoTT, infinitesimals/differentiation in SDG, continuity principles in synthetic topology etc.)? </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Foundations to study the (meta-)mathematics <em>of</em>: This is about the CPU of mathematics, what its powers and limitations are. How different chip architectures relate. For example, what relative consistency results can we prove between theories? E.g. independence of CH, relative consistency of “all subsets of the reals are Lebesgue measurable”, equiconsistency of Lean’s type theory with ZFC+countable many inaccessible cardinals etc. etc. What general tools and concepts can we develop to find such proofs? E.g. Gödel’s constructible universe, forcing, large cardinal axioms etc. etc.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>My point is that \"junk theorem arguments\" are entirely about 1. and not about 2. Theorems like <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn><mo>∈</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">0 \\in 1</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6835em;vertical-align:-0.0391em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">0</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">∈</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">1</span></span></span></span> are not meaningful to the vast majority of mathematicians (an empirical fact!) and this is just a particularly simple example of how ZFC-as-a-formalism does not reflect mathematical practice well and deserves criticism as a foundation in the sense of 1. (and in this sense only). This says nothing about how useful ZFC is for 2. One can both agree that ZFC deserves criticism as a foundation in the first sense, and also agree that it is indispensable as a foundation in the second sense, and, for the current lack of evidence to the contrary, maybe always will be indispensable for that purpose.</p>",

People sometimes imply that there's no reason why it would make sense to bother making a proof assistant fundamentally based on set theory, but the metamathematical content of 2 can feed back into 1. For instance, in a correctly designed proof assistant based on set theory, we'd know how to programmatically convert verified ZFC proofs of certain low-complexity statements into verified ZF proofs of the same statement using Shoenfield absoluteness. This is the kind of technology nobody's really bothered to implement 'natively' in type theories, and which does actually seem difficult to do cleanly in that context.</p>\n<p>Secondly, I think there's more in common type theories that don't line up with mathematical practice than advocates of type theory seem to be willing to admit. The issue of definitional vs. propositional equality is the primary one. This is just philosophically ugly and absolutely results in headaches in actually working with these kinds of systems (cf. \"dependent type hell\"). The propositions-as-types philosophy, while a really beautiful idea, also isn't really how most mathematicians think. Also a fair number of specific junk theorem arguments people use in regards to 1 apply equally well to some of the stuff that goes on in type theory, as I talked about before.</p>\n<p>Finally, I don't agree with the assertion that <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn><mo>∈</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">0 \\in 1</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6835em;vertical-align:-0.0391em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">0</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">∈</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">1</span></span></span></span> is not meaningful to the majority of mathematicians \"as an empirical fact!\" because that's the standard set-theoretic coding of <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn><mo>&lt;</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">0 &lt; 1</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6835em;vertical-align:-0.0391em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">0</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">&lt;</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">1</span></span></span></span>, which is absolutely a meaningful fact to all mathematicians.

Raw ZFC-based set theory doesn’t, you have no way to automatically “detect nonsense” as we seem to be able to do intuitively.</p>\n<p>The other point of the “<span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn><mo>∈</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">0 \\in 1</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6835em;vertical-align:-0.0391em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">0</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">∈</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">1</span></span></span></span> argument” that I see is perhaps too obvious for you to also see: ZFC encodes everything as sets. This is not a problem in itself, but I think it’s completely reasonable to feel at odds with the ontology of “everything is a set” and hence prefer something like ECTS as a foundation-to-do-mathematics-in, for conceptual reasons. But, of course, that’s just a choice you have to make based on what you find conceptually clear.</p>",

The system will let you name type synonyms and might be set up to avoid those kinds of collisions. But to me this is where there's really a double standard at play. When set theory is being criticized in this way, it isn't allowed to implement <em>any</em> amount of vernacular or elaboration, despite the fact that even set theorists do this regularly and proof assistants like Mizar implement a fair amount of elaboration on top of set theory. The double standard is that type theory with practical elaboration and implementation of vernacular is being compared to set theory with a level of elaboration chosen by the critic specifically to make set theory look bad, rather than an earnest attempt to implement a usable system on top of it. A proof assistant based on set theory with good UX would feel a lot closer to mathematical practice than literally writing out type-theoretic proofs in natural deduction.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Even lower-level languages like C do have types.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sure but x86 and ARM don't have types because there are contexts in which the added complexity of having a type system actually interferes with other goals (such as physically building a machine that correctly implements the language on bare metal), and as I argued earlier in this conversation I actually think that having a really low-level proof assistant kernel, such as one based on set theory, might make sense <em>even for practical use</em> (as opposed to just metamathematics) from the perspective of trust. Type theory has an objectively worse track record than set theory with inconsistency. Coq and Lean have both added things to their kernels that ended up being inconsistent and Agda is currently suspected to be inconsistent.</p>",

This means that I might have finite representations of <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"double-struck\">Z</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">/</mi><mn>4</mn><mi mathvariant=\"double-struck\">Z</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathbb{Z}/4\\mathbb{Z}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathbb\">Z</span><span class=\"mord\">/4</span><span class=\"mord mathbb\">Z</span></span></span></span> and <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi mathvariant=\"double-struck\">Z</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">/</mi><mn>2</mn><mi mathvariant=\"double-struck\">Z</mi><msup><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">(\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1.0641em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mopen\">(</span><span class=\"mord mathbb\">Z</span><span class=\"mord\">/2</span><span class=\"mord mathbb\">Z</span><span class=\"mclose\"><span class=\"mclose\">)</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.8141em;\"><span style=\"top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> living on the same type, along with the four suites of cards and the four seasons.</p>\n<p>A reasonable response to that point is that in an actual proof assistant, there's a certain amount of intensionality built into the user interface. The system will let you name type synonyms and might be set up to avoid those kinds of collisions. But to me this is where there's really a double standard at play. When set theory is being criticized in this way, it isn't allowed to implement <em>any</em> amount of vernacular or elaboration, despite the fact that even set theorists do this regularly and proof assistants like Mizar implement a fair amount of elaboration on top of set theory. The double standard is that type theory with practical elaboration and implementation of vernacular is being compared to set theory with a level of elaboration chosen by the critic specifically to make set theory look bad, rather than an earnest attempt to implement a usable system on top of it. A proof assistant based on set theory with good UX would feel a lot closer to mathematical practice than literally writing out type-theoretic proofs in natural deduction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sure, I don’t think I really disagree with anything you write here. All I wanted to point out earlier was that the “junk theorem arguments” about ZFC are not completely invalid in every context. They do have a point, and it’s about the conceptual content of foundations. The fact that everything is a set in ZFC, with “everything” forming the cumulative hierarchy, is the conceptual content that informs the axioms of ZFC. An argument that points out a discrepancy between this concept of a set and the structuralist one should be allowed. I’m just writing this because you seem to argue that it’s a bad (even bad-faith) argument, always, in any context, as a result of “double standards”. One can also make such “junk theorem” arguments about type theory, of course, like your example of a prime number being a pair of a natural number and a proof that it’s prime. This clarifies conceptually how type theory treats what would be just “subsets” in mathematical English. These are a simple but fair points both ways, illustrating the conceptual differences between different foundations. Everyone can then decide for themselves which concept of a set/type/etc. they prefer to think about. (E.g. I personally tend to think of bare sets as “discrete spaces” up to bijection, and not as sets of sets of sets ….) I’m most probably still not telling you anything new here, I’m sorry for that, but I do hope that clarifies what I wanted to say earlier.</p>",
