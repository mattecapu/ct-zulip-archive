        "content": "<p>Hello!</p>\n<p>I wanted to give a bit of an overview of the progress on the unproven claims of the Gaitsgory-Rozenblyum  book. To summarize, it seems to me that they are all proven except for one (but which should be soon).</p>\n<p>In what follows, I will refer to works that use a priori other definitions of the Gray tensor product that the one of Gaitsgory-Rozenblyum. However, as was mentioned earlier, Fernando proved that the Gray product in the Gaitsgory-Rozenblyum version is the same as in the Gagna-Harpaz-Lanari version. Moreover, even though I don’t think it’s clearly written in the literature (which is unfortunate, I admit), the Gagna-Harpaz-Lanari product is equivalent to all the other definitions I know.</p>\n<p>There were 8 claims for which the proofs were missing.</p>\n<p>• Propositions 3.2.6 and 3.3.9 concern the Gray tensor product (commutation with colimits and associativity). They should therefore follow from the comparison between the definition by Gaitsgory-Rozenblyum and the one by Gagna-Harpaz-Lanari, since Gagna-Harpaz-Lanari demonstrate that their version satisfies these properties (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14495\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14495</a>)</p>\n<p>• Proposition 3.3.5 discusses the fact that the iterated Gray product of simplices is an (strict) 2-category. To my knowledge, this result is not stated as such in the literature. However, I think one can deduce it quite directly from the results of Campion and Maehara presented in their article <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05965\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05965</a></p>\n<p>• Then there are Theorems 4.1.3, 4.3.5, 4.3.8, and 5.2.3 which discuss the square functor and its variants. The first was proven by Fernando (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12746\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12746</a>), and the last three in my latest preprint (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19242\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19242</a>)</p>\n<p>• Finally, there is Proposition 4.5.4 which gives yet another definition of the Gray tensor product.<br>\nIt should appear in a forthcoming article written with Jaco Ruit, but also in the new version of Fernando’s paper.</p>\n<p>It is very possible that I forgot to cite some works, and I apologize in advance. Let me know if this is the case !</p>",

(It is a left Quillen bifunctor with respect to Ara's model structure, and the induced oo-bifunctor agrees with the one defined by Day extension in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05965\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05965</a>; please see Remark 3.4 of that paper.) Although this tensor product is not associative up to isomorphism, it is associative up to homotopy in the best possible sense I can think of. (This is Corollary 7.11 of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.11757\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.11757</a> that Félix mentioned; \"cell(...)\" there is a subclass of the trivial cofibrations.) In particular, [n_1,...,n_k] in Proposition 3.3.5 of Gaitsgory-Rozenblyum can be computed by simply applying the k-ary Gray tensor product (Definition 3.1 of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.11757\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.11757</a>) to the representable Theta_2-sets corresponding to [n_i]'s, but this is <em>defined</em> to be the nerve of the corresponding 2-categorical Gray tensor product.</p>",
