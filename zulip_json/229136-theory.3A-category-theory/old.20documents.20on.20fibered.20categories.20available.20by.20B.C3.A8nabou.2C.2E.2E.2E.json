Roisin's notes of Bénabou's famous 1980 course at Louvain-la-Neuve</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www2.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de/~streicher/FibCatTexts/jb_chapitre1.pdf\">jb_chapitre1.pdf</a> is a copy of Chapter 1 of his never finished book \"Des Catégories Fibrées\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In 2 folders at the same place you find copies of the Theses of <a href=\"https://www2.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de/~streicher/FibCatTexts/CeleyretteThese\">Celeyrette</a> and <a href=\"https://www2.mathematik.tu-darmstadt.de/~streicher/FibCatTexts/MoensThese\">Moens</a>. The first one was directed by Jean himself and the second heavily influenced by Jean's 1980 course.</p>\n<p>The copies are partly of moderate quality but readable with a bit of good will. Would be great to have them typed within TAC Reprints series!</p>\n<p>Jean's work was very influential but not easily available. Hope these copies make it easier for younger people to form their own opinion about seminal work overshadowed by controversies in the past...</p>\n<p>I am grateful to Jonathan Weinberger for helping me to prepare the copies.</p>\n<p>Thomas Streicher</p>",

For the LNM, authors had to submit a “camera-ready copy”, and I'm not an expert in typewriters, so I can't say for sure which machine was used, but the use of subscripts and special characters suggests the Selectric. (Still some things had to be added by hand.)
