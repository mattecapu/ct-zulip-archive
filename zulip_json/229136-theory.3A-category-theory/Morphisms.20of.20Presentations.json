        "content": "<p>Hi,</p>\n<p>It's standard to speak of presenting structures by generators and relations (<a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/generators+and+relations\">https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/generators+and+relations</a>).  However I find scarcely any mention in the literature of morphisms between such presentations (rather than morphisms between the structures they generate).  I found it surprising that category theorists would discuss a kind of thing but then refrain from discussing morphisms between things of that kind.  Is this in the literature and I'm just not finding it?  Or is there some deeper reason that morphisms of presentations are not discussed?</p>\n<p>Here are the mentions/non-mentions I am aware of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The definition of CondGraph on p. 178 of \"Handbook of Categorical Algebra, vol. 1\" by Borceux.  However, here generating arrows must be sent to generating arrows, rather than arbitrary paths comprised of generating arrows</li>\n<li>Definition 8 of \"derived theory morphism\" in \"What is a Derived Signature Morphism?\" by Mossakowski et al. -- 2005</li>\n<li>Definition 4.32 in \"Algebraic Databases\" by Schultz et al. -- 2016.  The clearest example of what I am looking for</li>\n<li>\"Foundations of Algebraic Specification and Formal Software Development\" by Donald Sannella and Andrzej Tarlecki (2012) discusses gives bibliography for \"signature morphisms\" and \"derived signature morphisms\" at the end of chapter 1, which are still not exactly what I am talking about as \"signatures\" are just generators with no relations.</li>\n<li>Chapter 3 of \"Locally presentable and accessible categories\" by Adamek and Rosicky (1994) discusses \"Equational Presentations\" but not morphisms between them</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also relevant would be literature about morphisms between presentations of categories by generators or relations, or between sketches, or insight into why there is not such literature.</p>\n<p>For what it's worth, the reason I am inclined to discuss morphisms of presentations is that in computing, the presentation is the data that is stored, so if you want to describe morphisms, you must use presentations as objects -- you do not have access to the \"object itself\" generated by the presentation.</p>\n<p>P.S. I also sent this to the categories mailing list but it was not approved (yet?)  So if it is, then the post in <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"410322\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/410322-community.3A-mailing-list-mirror\">#community: mailing list mirror</a> should be cross-referenced to this</p>",

The word \"presentation\" is typically used in universal algebra to mean a signature together with a set of equations between terms derived from the signature. However, the nLab page for \"generators and relations\" describes a more abstract notion. The examples you give suggest you are after a description in the former style, but linking the nLab page suggests you are after a more abstract description. Which are you referring to?</p>",
