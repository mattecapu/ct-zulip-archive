        "content": "<p>There is a variant on the usual yoneda lemma where we do it relative to a category: say we have a functor <code>F : C -&gt; D</code> and <code>c : C</code>, <code>d : D</code> then we get a natural bijection between morphisms <code>F c -&gt; d</code> and <code>Nat[Hom(-, c), F ↓ d)</code>. One can recover the usual Yoneda lemma as a special case by writing a presheaf <code>P : C^op -&gt; Set</code> as <code>P~ : C -&gt; Set^op</code> and then taking <code>D = Set^op</code> and <code>d = *</code> in which case we get that <code>P~ ↓ *</code>  is the same as <code>P~</code>. This is also very related to the usual set-up for the limit/colimit formula for pointwise kan extensions. I am wondering if there are some more general povs from which to understand this sort of relative construction?</p>",
