Apparently, someone has taken the ZFC axioms, performed a long string of logical deductions, and arrived at a contradiction. The work has been checked and re-checked. There is no longer any doubt. How would you react? In particular, how would you feel about the implications for your own work? All your theorems would still be true under ZFC, but so too would their negations. Would you conclude that your life’s work had been destroyed?<br>\nI believe that most of us would be interested but not deeply troubled. We would go on believing that our theorems were true in a sense that their negations were not. We are unlikely to feel threatened by the inconsistency of axioms to<br>\nwhich we never referred anyway. In contrast, the ten axioms above are such core mathematical principles that an inconsistency in them would be devastating.

It is not easier to teach ETCS informally than it is to teach ZFC informally (which we can just call \"naive set theory with handwaving about proper classes\"). We can teach a formalism informally with the emphasis being on using it and showing how to practically carry out deductions in a way compatible with the framework, allowing students to build intuition for when an argument can and cannot be carried out in the formalism and learning to use it as a mental frame of reference for what is a rigorous argument. Or we can teach a formalism more formally with the goals being to show students that there are objective standards for rigorous mathematical proof that can be checked in a mechanical, algorithmic way, and that this formalism is in fact adequate to express these arguments, and allowing them to actually <em>see</em> that mathematics can be translated into the formalism, rather sketching it.</p>\n<p>Both ETCS and ZFC are equally suitable for either of these approaches. I do not believe that    it is easier to informally present ETCS than informally present ZFC.</p>\n<p>Honestly I'm not sure what the formalism is that he will present to the students because ETCS is a first order theory and he uses language suggestive of first order dependent type theory.</p>",

The implication is that material set theory axioms are weird, cryptic and esoteric, so that an inconsistency in ZFC would be unlikely to imply problems in our basic conceptions of mathematical reasoning, it is just formal symbol soup disconnected from mathematical reasoning and so an inconsistency would probably be unproblematic. On the other hand structural set theory directly reflects how mathematicians think and is necessarily much more likely to be consistent.</p>",

The idea of having a more segmented foundational system in which you do things like treat ordered pairs as primitive is older than set theory itself. Russell and Whithead had binary relations as primitive in <em>Principia Mathematica</em> and they arguably invented type theory in some form (although it has of course changed considerably since then). Similarly, Bourbaki had ordered pairs as primitives in one of their presentations of set theory (although, amusingly enough, one of their systems was eventually shown to be unable to prove the existence of <em>unordered</em> pairs).</p>\n<p>Likewise, while it's obviously dumb to go so far as to say that the finite von Neumann ordinals are what the natural numbers 'actually are', they <em>are</em> natural, especially in the context of infinite ordinals. It's a highly non-trivial structural fact about well-ordered sets that (classically) the well-order types are themselves well-ordered by initial segment. A relatively 'univalent' mindset then suggests the idea that it would be nice if we could <em>literally</em> represent a well-order type as the collection of smaller well-ordered types, and at that point what you're thinking of is precisely the von Neumann ordinals.</p>",

For instance, if we were designing a proof assistant for 'finitary' mathematics around the consistency strength of PA, we certainly wouldn't have PA be the exposed end-user theory and we might not even really use it for the kernel either. But I also think there's a reason that metamathematics of arithmetic research doesn't work with finitary set theories that often. It's because the global structure of natural numbers-like objects is a bit easier to reason about. Things like cuts are pretty simple to visualize. The fact that coding stuff in PA results in far worse junk theorems than ZFC is irrelevant.</p>",

If you'll forgive me for possibly putting words in your mouth, I feel like one of the core points you and Leinster are arguing is something to the effect of 'The non-categorical structure present in ZFC isn't really relevant to everyday mathematics.' Obviously for the sake of friendliness, Leinster isn't phrasing ETCS in directly categorical terms, but I feel it's pretty clear that the formalism is motivated by category theory. The thing is that I don't find this point (which, again, maybe you don't agree is one of the things you're saying) entirely convincing.

        "content": "<p>I can see now that I was wrong in that I was pretty considerably overestimating how difficult these things would be to formalize in ETCS+R, but I feel like there's one of your points that I still disagree with pretty strongly, although of course I could be wrong here too.</p>\n<p>You and Leinster both allude to the possibility that pure set theory research itself might be better done in a more categorically motivated framework like ETCS. For instance you said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Certainly current set theorists find ZFC easier; but how much of that is intrinsic, and how much of that is just that it's what they're used to and what all the literature uses? I don't think we can really say.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The thing is that I feel like there is enough evidence regarding this point to reasonably come to the conclusion that, no, set theorists are not just working in ZFC because of historical inertia. A huge amount of the truly technical work in set theory has to do with really detailed 'fine structure'; you think about building set-theoretic universes 'brick by brick.' This pretty naturally involves <em>more precisely structured</em> versions of the cumulative hierarchy, stuff like L, L[R], and fancier versions of L that are able to accommodate larger large cardinals. This is what eventually leads into things like the inner model program and mice and such.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that L and other inner model constructions aren't only relevant in the context of ZFC; they're an important notion in basically all ZF-like set theories, even ones weaker than ETCS, such as KP. So even if we accept Leinster's point that ETCS doesn't really need replacement or pass to working in something like a classical type theory with no global replacement, it doesn't change the relevance of L-like constructions to metamathematics. Absoluteness arguments involving small extensions of L are how you show that certain broad classes of classical theorems don't need the axiom of choice. Removing appeals to choice from theorems is something that you obviously care about and a decent amount of non-set-theorist mathematicians also care about. People write papers about 'dezornifying' well-known results seemingly without knowing about existing general theorems in set theory that could accomplish the same end.</p>\n<p>Lawvere's paper on ETCS was published in 1964, <em>60 years ago.</em> Gödel's L construction was already 26 years old at that point. The construction of L is not an intensely technical thing. It's routinely taught as part of one-semester intro graduate set theory courses. I get the impression from this conversation that in the last 60 years no significant work has been published on trying to smoothly run the construction of L or other inner models in ETCS or some other more categorically motivated framework, otherwise you would certainly know about it and would have mentioned it earlier. Lawvere's original paper and the nLab article on the constructible universe don't mention anything like this either. Why hasn't there been more work on translating basic, fundamental ideas in the field of set theory to a structural framework? Is it just lack of interest? The thing is that I feel like a graduate student or particularly advanced undergradute could write down the construction of L in ETCS. It's really not that hard. It's just that the resulting thing would need to pass through a ZF-like construction and many basic properties of L are proven with exceedingly materialistic methods, such as the condensation lemma. None of this seems very categorically natural, and, in fact, I don't think it is <em>categorically</em> natural. I think it's a different kind of fundamental structure, and at the moment it seems to me that it <em>is</em> obfuscated, to some extent, by the big-pile-of-stuff ontology of categorical frameworks like ETCS.</p>",

But I'm not ready to throw in the towel just yet.</p>\n<p>L and its ilk are, to me, one of the most mysterious objects in mathematics.  On the one hand, as you say, the only way we know how to construct them is heavily material.  But on the other hand, they clearly have a structural <em>meaning</em>: the category of sets and functions in L is distinct from the category of sets and functions in V, and because ZFC is equivalent to ETCS+R, the category of sets and functions in L carries all the same information as L itself.  So it seems contrary to reason to me that there would be no way to achieve the same or a similar construction directly structurally.</p>\n<p>This is especially true since practically <em>everything else in mathematics</em> is structural.  If you're right, then set theory would be effectively <em>unique in all of mathematics</em> in depending on non-structural properties.  It just seems highly unlikely to me, <em>a priori</em>, that any one area of mathematics would be different from the rest of mathematics in this way.</p>\n<p>I also feel like there's a mathematical reason to care, namely that once you pass to weaker theories, the structural ones are no longer <em>equivalent</em> to the material ones, only mutually interpretable.  So, for instance, it's not clear to me how to use L-like constructions, with the extant understanding of them, to say things about a non-boolean topos or pretopos.</p>\n<p>I agree that, as you say, the current definitions of inner models are exceedingly materialistic and would would highly unnatural and awkward if simply passed across to ETCS.  But it's not clear to me that this is an argument against the possibility of achieving something equivalent with a <em>different</em> construction that <em>would</em> be more natural in structural set theory.  As you say, in the past 60 years no one has done it.  But how many people have really tried?  Mathematics is full of things that could have been discovered decades earlier than they were, if anyone had thought of them, but it just happens that nobody did.</p>",

I don't remember the exact story, but I seem to recall hearing that Gödel himself thought about the construction as being somehow about the interplay between the impredicativity of the ordinals and this very explicit, almost constructive, definable powerset operation. (I think he might have explicitly cited constructive mathematics as inspiring the construction.) In some sense I feel like it's maybe analogous to Turing completeness or Gödel's original arithmetization of syntax in that there's something significant about the fact that a system doesn't need to have certain kinds of structure to be explicitly present in order to be able to code that structure indirectly.</p>\n<p>Even though people have written down the definition and looked at it, I don't yet feel like I really understand what's going on with L in constructive set theory (and by extension in non-Boolean toposes). I'm pretty sure it doesn't admit the same kind of ordinal computation picture, since that relies on the kind of case splitting you really can't do with arbitrary ordinals constructively. I actually asked Rathjen if he knew of any choice-like structural consequences of V=L over IZF or CZF and, if I recall correctly, he said he didn't know any without extra assumptions like LEM for bounded sentences.</p>",

If you're right, then set theory would be effectively <em>unique in all of mathematics</em> in depending on non-structural properties. It just seems highly unlikely to me, <em>a priori</em>, that any one area of mathematics would be different from the rest of mathematics in this way.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Anyway, I guess that broadly it's kind of hard for me to come away from conversations like this without the feeling that some of the animosity set theorists (and classical mathematical logicians more broadly) feel towards category theory isn't <em>entirely</em> unjustified.</p>\n<p>Since Mac Lane and Lawvere, people have been insinuating or outright stating that set theorists are 'doing set theory wrong' because they're not using more category theory (or, more problematically in my opinion, that what set theorists are doing is 'meaningless' because it doesn't seem categorically natural). But, as we have just discussed, people who are interested in doing set theory 'correctly' haven't come up with a satisfactory explanation of the 'real meaning' of a nearly 90-year-old theorem for more than half a century. This is Chapter VI of Kunen.</p>\n<p>You implied that if L really is 'non-structural,' then it would make set theory unique in mathematics, but I think that 'essentially non-structural' properties are maybe more common in classical mathematical logic than you're implying. For starters, as I said, L is just the absolute beginning of set theory. Since it is actually canonical it seems maybe more amenable to categorical analysis, but fancier inner models like L[U] aren't going to be the initial object in some category because they're not unique.</p>\n<p>There's a really concrete example of this in computability theory. The Friedberg–Muchnik theorem (i.e., that there is a c.e. set with Turing degree strictly between <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mn mathvariant=\"bold\">0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathbf{0}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathbf\">0</span></span></span></span> and <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msup><mn mathvariant=\"bold\">0</mn><mo mathvariant=\"normal\" lspace=\"0em\" rspace=\"0em\">′</mo></msup></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathbf{0}&#x27;</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.7519em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathbf\">0</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.7519em;\"><span style=\"top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\">′</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>) is proven with a priority argument which involves <em>in a seemingly essential way</em> picking some specific enumeration of Turing machines. It's widely conjectured among computability theorists that there is no 'natural construction' of an intermediate Turing degree, something which doesn't rely on a particular choice of enumeration. The impression that Andrej Bauer gave me when we talked about this is that nobody knows how to give a presentation of priority arguments in terms of synthetic computability. Priority arguments are the <em>absolute core</em> of computability theory. And, again, the Friedberg–Muchnik theorem was published in 1956/1957, nearly 70 years ago. Andrej's original paper on synthetic computability theory isn't nearly as old as Lawvere's paper on ETCS, but it's still coming up on 20 years at this point.</p>\n<p>But also, I don't know, to me Turing completeness itself is something of a 'non-structural' phenomenon. There doesn't seem to be a candidate for a canonical model of computation, but there's still a level of 'richness' at which all models of 'explicit' finitary computation become equivalent. And it feels like maybe L could be a similar kind of phenomenon. What's going on in the construction of L is that if you take some sufficiently rich 'explicit' way of constructing sets in a really slow, careful, brick-by-brick way and iterate it along an impredicatively long 'large ordinal,' you get something that seems internally like a 'full' universe of sets and, moreover, any two constructions of this end up being equivalent. It may very well be the case that there just is no canonical 'god-given' model for that slow, careful construction.</p>",

In a historically revisionist way, set theorists discovered that a certain quotient-inductive type is sufficiently rich to reflect the behavior of a huge amount of the rest of mathematics (especially in the context of a strong, impredicative classical theory with choice). Moreover, by studying 'the combinatorics of well-founded trees' as some people dismissively phrase it, they're able to very precisely build models of ETCS+R that satisfy or don't satisfy a huge variety of statements, as well as doing other impressive stuff such as automatically removing choice from the proofs of various theorems. </p>\n<p>To me this could be seen as directly analogous to discovering that untyped lambda-calculus is Turing complete. Type theorists spend a lot of time thinking about really detailed specifics of the behavior of lambda-calculus and variants thereof because they decided it was a good framework to think about these things, but untyped lambda-calculus isn't what computation <em>is</em>. Term normalization isn't what computation <em>is</em>.

The ordinals (in the sense of isomorphism classes of well-ordered sets) have a pretty clear rigid global structure (since they are themselves well-ordered up to isomorphism by initial segments). Since we have choice, any small configuration of sets is isomorphic to a configuration of subsets of finite sequences from a fixed well-ordered set, which you can then think of as a configuration of finite sequences of ordinals. If we have just a little bit of replacement, the ordinals are closed under Gödel's ordinal pairing function, which is arbitrary but very absolute in the set-theorist's sense. Using this (and possibly some other tricks involving Cantor normal form) we can code these arbitrary configurations as just sets of ordinals. So in this way you arrive at the idea of representing set theory sort of as the theory of 'second-order ordinal arithmetic' (but with the stipulation, provided that we have a little bit of replacement, that sets of ordinals are bounded).</p>\n<p>Second-order ordinal arithmetic is a decently nice theory and set theorists do sometimes say that this is what ZFC 'really is' (i.e., the theory of ordinals and sets of ordinals), but one annoying thing about it is that it's even more material than ZFC. You have no native representation of sets of sets of ordinals. The power set axiom itself is quite a pain to actually even state (although the flipside is that choice is of course automatic in this context). One thing also I think should be noted is that L has to me a pretty clear description in this context as being the smallest family of sets of ordinals closed under some very basic closure conditions that any model of this theory (with the same ordinals) must have. In the presence of enough replacement, this smallest family is then itself a model of the theory.</p>\n<p>So, now, assuming we have, say, full replacement, one thing we could do at this point is flesh the theory out into a fuller classical almost Principia-style 'type theory' (although it's not going to be quite like most MLTT-style type theories). We have a set <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>O</mi><mi>α</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">O_\\alpha</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8333em;vertical-align:-0.15em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.02778em;\">O</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t vlist-t2\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.1514em;\"><span style=\"top:-2.55em;margin-left:-0.0278em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal mtight\" style=\"margin-right:0.0037em;\">α</span></span></span></span><span class=\"vlist-s\">​</span></span><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.15em;\"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> for each ordinal <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>α</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\alpha</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.4306em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.0037em;\">α</span></span></span></span>, which is just a canonical choice of a well-ordered set of that length. Then we have power sets, function sets, and products and coproducts of families indexed by sets in a sufficiently explicit way (i.e., first-order definable). All of these constructors were there already up to isomorphism, but now we're more explicitly tracking the 'provenance' of various sets, which is useful for thinking about the interplay between the power set operation (and the other constructors) and the ordinals, which is in some sense the heart of what makes different set-theoretic universes (with choice, etc.) 'actually different.' For instance, CH is a statement of this kind. In particular though, we're going to assume that all sets are built using these constructors. This gives us a good induction principle to prove things about arbitrary sets. Since we already know every set is isomorphic to some <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>O</mi><mi>α</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">O_\\alpha</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8333em;vertical-align:-0.15em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.02778em;\">O</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t vlist-t2\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.1514em;\"><span style=\"top:-2.55em;margin-left:-0.0278em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal mtight\" style=\"margin-right:0.0037em;\">α</span></span></span></span><span class=\"vlist-s\">​</span></span><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.15em;\"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> (since we have choice), if our goal is to track this interplay carefully, we want to have an explicit description of where everything is coming from.</p>\n<p>At this point though, I am obviously going to point out that well-founded trees have naturally popped up in what we're talking about. We started from ordinals, which are of course closely related to well-founded trees, but then we've added explicit bookkeeping for these set-generating operations, which also naturally have the structure of well-founded trees (since we're assuming all of the sets are generated by our constructors). Well-founded trees are very natural in the context of induction on infinite structures, and by assuming choice, we've made it so that 'everything is controlled by induction' in some sense. So at this point, I feel like it's reasonable to conclude that thinking about well-founded trees might be a natural way of understanding the combinatorial behavior of a universe of sets.</p>\n<p>This thing I've described might at this point be a decently 'usable' theory, depending on how you implement in precisely. One could probably make a reasonable proof assistant based on it (maybe with some more inductive constructions thrown in explicitly). I would also argue that this is maybe a decent approximation of what mathematicians who are 'working in ZFC' are 'actually working in.' But if our goal is to do metamathematics, I still maintain there's some value in minimizing primitives. (Obviously we started from a theory with fewer primitives, but not all ways of minimizing primitives are equally useful.) Even type theorists do this. System F doesn't explicitly have inductive types, for instance. Some of the things I described are obviously redundant since we're working with classical sets. Functions can obviously be coded as subsets of the product, but products themselves can also be coded in terms of power sets of coproducts. And maybe this is where I might lose you if I haven't already, but if you whittle this down enough you get to the point that the only thing you <em>really</em> need is iterating power sets along the ordinals (with coproducts at limit ordinals). This suggests a 'slightly typed' von Neumann hierarchy: <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>U</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>=</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">∅</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">U_0 = \\varnothing</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8333em;vertical-align:-0.15em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.10903em;\">U</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t vlist-t2\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.3011em;\"><span style=\"top:-2.55em;margin-left:-0.109em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\">0</span></span></span></span><span class=\"vlist-s\">​</span></span><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.15em;\"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">=</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6633em;vertical-align:-0.0817em;\"></span><span class=\"mord amsrm\">∅</span></span></span></span>, <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>U</mi><mrow><mi>α</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub><mo>=</mo><mi mathvariant=\"script\">P</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><msub><mi>U</mi><mi>α</mi></msub><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">U_{\\alpha + 1} = \\mathcal{P}(U_\\alpha)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8917em;vertical-align:-0.2083em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.10903em;\">U</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t vlist-t2\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.3011em;\"><span style=\"top:-2.55em;margin-left:-0.109em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal mtight\" style=\"margin-right:0.0037em;\">α</span><span class=\"mbin mtight\">+</span><span class=\"mord mtight\">1</span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"vlist-s\">​</span></span><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.2083em;\"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">=</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathcal\" style=\"margin-right:0.08222em;\">P</span><span class=\"mopen\">(</span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.10903em;\">U</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t vlist-t2\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.1514em;\"><span style=\"top:-2.55em;margin-left:-0.109em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal mtight\" style=\"margin-right:0.0037em;\">α</span></span></span></span><span class=\"vlist-s\">​</span></span><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.15em;\"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"mclose\">)</span></span></span></span>, and <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>U</mi><mi>λ</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><msub><mo>⨁</mo><mrow><mi>α</mi><mo>&lt;</mo><mi>λ</mi></mrow></msub><msub><mi>U</mi><mi>α</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">U_{\\lambda} = \\bigoplus_{\\alpha &lt;

This is basically a transfinite version of TST (Théorie Simple des Types, which was itself constructed to be a version of Principia Mathematica with fewer primitives) and is <em>really</em> close to the actual von Neumann hierarchy in ZFC. In some sense the only real difference is the absence of 'subtyping.'</p>\n<p>At this point I think the motivation for going to the actual von Neumann hierarchy is a maybe a little bit harder to state, and yes, possibly a bit historical. (Although I'll be quick to point out that Coq itself has universe subtyping in its own 'cumulative hierarchy,' so I don't think it's prima facie a ridiculous design decision.) I think there are still some arguments for the 'von Neumann hierarchy with subtyping,' but I think I need to spend some time thinking about what things like measurable cardinals and the condensation lemma look like in this picture I've painted.</p>",

To me this is sort of similar to thinking about algebraic varieties up to birational equivalence. It's an easier-to-resolve, coarser version of a question, like a useful first sanity check.

        "content": "<p>Hi all. I'm coming late to this thread but thought I should say something.</p>\n<p>The course I'll be teaching in Edinburgh this autumn, Axiomatic Set Theory, is principally for undergraduates in their last two years. As John says, it'll be a rigorous development of set theory based on the ETCS axioms, but I'll neither assume nor teach the notion of category. The tentative chapter/week headings are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Introduction</li>\n<li>The axioms, part one</li>\n<li>The axioms, part two</li>\n<li>Subsets</li>\n<li>Relations</li>\n<li>Coproducts and families</li>\n<li>Number systems</li>\n<li>Well-ordered sets</li>\n<li>The axiom of choice</li>\n<li>Cardinal arithmetic.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I'm really excited to be teaching this course, because as far as I know, nothing like it has ever been done before.</p>\n<p>Plus, lots of people -- even category theorists and set theorists -- don't realize it <em>can</em> be done! For example, two people I know who are knowledgeable in both subjects assumed I'd have to get into toposes, and didn't realize it's possible to do everything in a completely elementary way. I want the world to know!</p>\n<p>I like to explain this point by analogy with number theory and rings. If you're going to teach an introductory number theory course, you have a choice. You could say \"the integers form a ring, number theory eventually needs rings other than the integers, and rings are important throughout mathematics anyway, so I'm going to begin my course by introducing rings and then specialize to the integers\". Alternatively, you could say \"basic number theory doesn't require the general notion of ring, so let's just talk directly about addition, subtraction and multiplication of integers without ever mentioning rings\". Both kinds of course are valuable. The first is like teaching ETCS via the general notion of category, more or less as in Lawvere and Rosebrugh's book <em>Sets for Mathematics</em>. The second is like my course: no categories, just sets and functions done directly.</p>\n<p>I'll say almost nothing in the course about membership-based set theories such as ZFC. I'll have to say <em>something</em>, as we're not in a cultural vacuum: some students will already have had some contact with ZFC, and I'll need to address the usual questions. But it'll be kept to an absolute minimum.</p>\n<p>On some other points...</p>\n<p>I have the same respect for set theory research as I do for any other branch of mathematics. It's a subject full of strange and wonderful things uncovered by brilliant people. What separates set theory from, say, differential geometry or harmonic analysis or semigroup theory is the claim that set theory -- specifically, ZFC -- has a special, central role in the whole of mathematics. Such a claim becomes the business of all mathematicians.</p>\n<p>I believe it should be possible to discuss and debate such claims in a calm and constructive way. In fact, I know it <em>is</em> possible: when I wrote a <a href=\"https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2012/12/rethinking_set_theory.html\">blog post</a> to accompany what was to become my <em>American Mathematical Monthly</em> article <a href=\"https://maa.org/press/periodicals/american-mathematical-monthly/american-mathematical-monthly-%20contents-may-2014\">Rethinking set theory</a>, there was a fantastic conversation of 200+ comments, involving widely different viewpoints, that was extremely civil and enlightening.</p>\n<p>Personally, I've said just about all I want to say about the mismatch (as I see it) between sets as treated in membership-based set theories like ZFC and sets as used in practice by the vast majority of mathematicians. (In a nutshell, it's not so much the ZFC <em>axioms</em> that are the problem, it's the very set-up: that elements of sets are always sets, and that one can always legitimately ask whether one set is an element of another.) I have no desire to have that conversation again. Right now, I'm much more interested in demonstrating what set theory looks like when you develop everything in ETCS.</p>\n<p>Regarding my past writings, nothing I've written about sets is intended to be hyperbolic. If something I've said looks like hyperbole, please consider that it's probably my genuinely held opinion, however much you might think it's impossible that anyone could really believe it. Of course, I'm as human as anyone and may sometimes have slipped up. I'm acutely aware of how sensitive these matters are (look at the first few paragraphs of <a href=\"https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2012/12/rethinking_set_theory.html\">that blog post</a>), I know how deep a personal attachment every mathematician has to their own research area, and I have no desire to hurt or antagonize anyone. So I work hard to avoid overstatement. I want to produce light, not heat -- although I'm aware that sometimes it's impossible to have one without the other.</p>\n<p>And this respect for differing views should go in all directions. In particular, grand claims are made for the place of ZFC in mathematics, and it's natural and healthy for those claims to be challenged. I would hope that those who advocate for the special role of ZFC (and its friends) would welcome these challenges as an opportunity to reflect and engage constructively, as people like François Dorais did in that really productive n-Café thread, and as in some of the conversation going on here right now.</p>\n<p>I also hope that everyone, regardless of viewpoint, will agree that it's worthwhile to at least <em>see what happens</em> when you try to develop axiomatic set theory based on ETCS, without reference to categories, in a way that works for undergraduates. Maybe it will be a disaster, maybe it will all work out wonderfully, or, most likely, it will be somewhere in between -- but in any case, it'll be food for thought.</p>",

I'm coming late to this thread but thought I should say something.</p>\n<p>The course I'll be teaching in Edinburgh this autumn, Axiomatic Set Theory, is principally for undergraduates in their last two years. As John says, it'll be a rigorous development of set theory based on the ETCS axioms, but I'll neither assume nor teach the notion of category. The tentative chapter/week headings are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Introduction</li>\n<li>The axioms, part one</li>\n<li>The axioms, part two</li>\n<li>Subsets</li>\n<li>Relations</li>\n<li>Coproducts and families</li>\n<li>Number systems</li>\n<li>Well-ordered sets</li>\n<li>The axiom of choice</li>\n<li>Cardinal arithmetic.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I'm really excited to be teaching this course, because as far as I know, nothing like it has ever been done before.</p>\n<p>Plus, lots of people -- even category theorists and set theorists -- don't realize it <em>can</em> be done! For example, two people I know who are knowledgeable in both subjects assumed I'd have to get into toposes, and didn't realize it's possible to do everything in a completely elementary way. I want the world to know!</p>\n<p>I like to explain this point by analogy with number theory and rings. If you're going to teach an introductory number theory course, you have a choice. You could say \"the integers form a ring, number theory eventually needs rings other than the integers, and rings are important throughout mathematics anyway, so I'm going to begin my course by introducing rings and then specialize to the integers\". Alternatively, you could say \"basic number theory doesn't require the general notion of ring, so let's just talk directly about addition, subtraction and multiplication of integers without ever mentioning rings\". Both kinds of course are valuable. The first is like teaching ETCS via the general notion of category, more or less as in Lawvere and Rosebrugh's book <em>Sets for Mathematics</em>. The second is like my course: no categories, just sets and functions done directly.</p>\n<p>I'll say almost nothing in the course about membership-based set theories such as ZFC. I'll have to say <em>something</em>, as we're not in a cultural vacuum: some students will already have had some contact with ZFC, and I'll need to address the usual questions. But it'll be kept to an absolute minimum.</p>\n<p>On some other points...</p>\n<p>I have the same respect for set theory research as I do for any other branch of mathematics. It's a subject full of strange and wonderful things uncovered by brilliant people. What separates set theory from, say, differential geometry or harmonic analysis or semigroup theory is the claim that set theory -- specifically, ZFC -- has a special, central role in the whole of mathematics. Such a claim becomes the business of all mathematicians.</p>\n<p>I believe it should be possible to discuss and debate such claims in a calm and constructive way. In fact, I know it <em>is</em> possible: when I wrote a <a href=\"https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2012/12/rethinking_set_theory.html\">blog post</a> to accompany what was to become my <em>American Mathematical Monthly</em> article <a href=\"https://maa.org/press/periodicals/american-mathematical-monthly/american-mathematical-monthly-%20contents-may-2014\">Rethinking set theory</a>, there was a fantastic conversation of 200+ comments, involving widely different viewpoints, that was extremely civil and enlightening.</p>\n<p>Personally, I've said just about all I want to say about the mismatch (as I see it) between sets as treated in membership-based set theories like ZFC and sets as used in practice by the vast majority of mathematicians. (In a nutshell, it's not so much the ZFC <em>axioms</em> that are the problem, it's the very set-up: that elements of sets are always sets, and that one can always legitimately ask whether one set is an element of another.) I have no desire to have that conversation again. Right now, I'm much more interested in demonstrating what set theory looks like when you develop everything in ETCS.</p>\n<p>Regarding my past writings, nothing I've written about sets is intended to be hyperbolic. If something I've said looks like hyperbole, please consider that it's probably my genuinely held opinion, however much you might think it's impossible that anyone could really believe it. Of course, I'm as human as anyone and may sometimes have slipped up. I'm acutely aware of how sensitive these matters are (look at the first few paragraphs of <a href=\"https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2012/12/rethinking_set_theory.html\">that blog post</a>), I know how deep a personal attachment every mathematician has to their own research area, and I have no desire to hurt or antagonize anyone. So I work hard to avoid overstatement. I want to produce light, not heat -- although I'm aware that sometimes it's impossible to have one without the other.</p>\n<p>And this respect for differing views should go in all directions. In particular, grand claims are made for the place of ZFC in mathematics, and it's natural and healthy for those claims to be challenged.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hi, Tom. As I am responsible for some of the harsh language in this thread I apologize for the vitriol. I think your book on higher categories and higher operads is excellent and I found a lot of value in it. I will try to be less astringent in the future. I hope your class goes well.</p>",

Near the end, when discussing possible downsides for a student going into set theory learning ETCS first, you say</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A second disadvantage is that any student planning a career in set theory will need to learn ZFC anyway, since almost all research-level set theory is done with the iterated-membership conception of set. (That is the current reality, which is not to say that set theory <em>must</em> be done this way.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Obviously your article isn't about research into pure set theory, it's about trying to improve the relationship between set theory and the rest of mathematics. As Mike pointed out, what you're doing could be a nice bridge for non-set-theorist mathematicians to engage with set theory more. And, to be clear, mathematicians and set theorists should stop saying that ZFC is 'the foundation of mathematics,' and set theorists should broaden their horizons, but by presenting no substantive devil's advocate argument for why set theorists might not really get that much out of ETCS, you rhetorically leave open the implication that there might be no good reason at all that set theorists tend to study material set theories rather than structural set theories. This is obviously possible prima facie, but as I've been discussing with Mike, I feel like there's pretty ample evidence at this point that there is more to the fact that set theorists haven't switched to ETCS(+R) than just cultural inertia.</p>\n<p>When you put out <em>Rethinking</em> in 2012, Lawvere's paper on ETCS was already 48 years old. Gödel's L construction, one of the first spectacular results of set-theoretic metamathematics, was 74 years old. As we are currently discussing <em>right now</em>, it's an open research problem to find the 'correct' categorical presentation of L. L is an extremely important tool in set-theoretic metamathematics (and it shows up a surprising amount in computability theory and reverse math too). It really is no exaggeration to say that it is the beginning of the story of modern set theory research. For instance, it plays a major role in Saharon Shelah's 1974 proof that the Whitehead problem is independent of ZFC (and therefore independent of any theory ZFC can 'reasonably' interpret, such as classical HoTT).</p>\n<p>How would you propose presenting Solovay's 1970 construction of a model in which all sets of reals are Lebesgue measurable? The standard presentation of this construction involves passing to a HOD-like inner model, and HOD is even more tied up in the iterative-set concept than L is. This is a pretty big result in set theory that mathematicians <em>outside of set theory</em> care about; it's not an esoteric question about premice and fine structure of large cardinals. If a student asks about this result in your class, what are you going to say? \"Sorry, we haven't been able to crack that nut yet, just give us a few more decades\"?</p>\n<p>To give another example, consider <a href=\"https://api.repository.cam.ac.uk/server/api/core/bitstreams/c25d3d5b-f0bb-4842-9f7e-f8d81afe57be/content\">this type theory paper</a> by Fiore, Pitts, and Steenkamp. In order to establish the expressiveness of quotient-inductive types, this paper cites Blass's result that (under some large cardinal assumptions) it is consistent with ZF that there is an infinitary equational theory with no initial algebra in ZF. Blass's result relies in an essential way on Gitik's famous 1980 result of the consistency of all uncountable cardinals being singular (relative to some large cardinals). This is a pretty technical class forcing result that frankly type theorists and categorical logicians don't seem to be even remotely equipped to prove. (And to be clear, that's obviously fine; type theorists and categorical logicians have their own stories that they're exploring. Set theorists aren't remotely equipped to prove plenty of things too.) But the only formal work I can find about class forcing over toposes is talk notes by David from 2018 about trying to make topos class forcing work and I get the definite impression from those notes that it's just very hard and unclear how to proceed. Maybe David will let us know if he's made more progress on this, but as far as I can tell nothing more has really been written about it.</p>\n<p>For me, it's hard to not sit back and feel like it's somewhat intuitively obvious why these things are so difficult. With toposes in particular, some of it has to be working constructively, but a big part of the difficulty is that ETCS and topos theory eschew most of the global 'scaffolding' that is present in ZF-like set theories. What makes L-like constructions a complete pain in more structural theories like Z and second-order arithmetic is that you need to locally build this scaffolding everywhere, instead of having it all in one uniform structure. This scaffolding might not be categorically natural, but it's extremely useful for doing detailed global constructions like inner models and class forcing. One could almost think of models of ZFC as a 'normal form' for models of ETCS+R. Admittedly this scaffolding doesn't <em>need</em> to take the form that it does in ZFC, as I already discussed, but it is still seemingly fundamentally at odds with the categorical mindset, since when you build a set-theoretic universe 'brick-by-brick,' you build many redundant isomorphic copies of the same set which nevertheless 'live at different places in the scaffolding.'</p>\n<p>Given the general stigma against set theory in mathematics and the frankly toxic rhetoric coming from some of the people criticizing set theory and set theorists and given the fact that an extremely common element of that criticism is the very same junk theorem argument you hold up as the fatal flaw of ZF-like theories, I feel like you have some amount of academic responsibility to address these points when criticizing the main object that set theorists are studying, regardless of the legitimacy of the junk theorem argument in the context of practical usability. Despite working with a system riddled with 'nonsense' like <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>∈</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">2 \\in 3</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6835em;vertical-align:-0.0391em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">2</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">∈</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">3</span></span></span></span> and despite not using the 'correct' understanding of forcing, nobody seems to be able to get as far with these kinds of classical metamathematical questions as set theorists studying ZF-like theories. One can always say 'well it doesn't <em>need</em> to be this way, set theorists could be working in a different system, they could be using toposes or ETCS,' but after some number of decades of struggling to translate basic tools of pure set theory research, I feel like maintaining this edges into the territory of not respecting the intellectual autonomy of the field.</p>",

        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"645679\">@James E Hanson</span>  -- thanks very much for your considered response (and please, call me Tom).</p>\n<p>Again, I think this is a matter of differing viewpoints rather than bad faith. You quoted from the paragraph of my paper where I was discussing potential disadvantages of teaching ETCS:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>almost all research-level set theory is done with the iterated-membership conception of set. (That is the current reality, which is not to say that set theory <em>must</em> be done this way.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The parenthetical comment was mainly to clarify that the \"is done\" of the previous sentence wasn't intended to be normative. In other words, I didn't want to give the impression that just because set theory research <em>is</em> done a certain way, it necessarily follows that it <em>has to be</em>. I was just making the mild statement that I'm not taking a position on the matter.</p>\n<p>If I'd thought it was established beyond reasonable doubt that set theory research could only be done in an element-based way, then I guess I wouldn't have added that parenthetical sentence. But I wasn't convinced of that, and I'm still not, which is where our views differ.</p>\n<p>(Also, if I'd known of a good source making the kind of argument you're making here, then I should perhaps have cited it; but I didn't.)</p>\n<p>I think you know the following, but just to be extra clear for anyone else reading: I don't claim that all set theory <em>can</em> be done nicely in a structural way. I simply don't know. I think it's an interesting question well worth exploring. You may be absolutely right, and it may be that research-level set theory really isn't viable without adopting a membership-based or material viewpoint. But I, personally, am not yet convinced of that.</p>\n<p>So, why am I not convinced?</p>\n<p>First, because human beings are ingenious, and I think it's rash to rule out a possibility. Maybe there's even a fantastic way of doing set theory that's neither material nor structural, but unlike anything any of us have thought of.</p>\n<p>Second, from the results on the close relationship between ZFC and ETCS+R, we know that any argument about ZFC <em>can</em> be turned into an argument about ETCS+R. (Thank you, by the way, for correcting my usage of \"biinterpretable\".) The question then becomes the more subjective one of whether it seems \"natural\" or \"helpful\" to do things in ETCS+R.</p>\n<p>Of course, not all of set theory is about ZFC. There must be many questions in set theory research that no one would claim can be helpfully addressed in a structural way, because they're specifically element-based in nature. The directions taken in set theory research, the questions asked and the problems regarded as important by its practitioners, have surely been shaped by the dominant material viewpoint. Different directions would have been taken and prioritized if the structural viewpoint had been dominant. And that's another sense in which I'm not convinced that set theory research can't be done structurally: if it were, we'd be asking and answering different questions.</p>\n<p>I'm entirely open to the possibility that you're right: that there are results in set theory, of direct relevance to parts of mathematics outside logic, where the material approach is really the only sensible one. You mention Solovay's result on Lebesgue measurability and Shelah's on the Whitehead problem. Personally, I've never read their proofs, so I'm in no position to pronounce on whether or not they could be done in a nice structural way. That's why I'm keeping my mind open and remaining noncommittal.</p>\n<p>(Incidentally, I'd give them same \"I don't know\" answer to a student, in the unlikely event that anyone asked. I should emphasize that my course is for undergraduates and so relatively basic.

My own little contribution was to spend a couple of months learning some stuff about large cardinals (new to me at the time), understanding everything structurally, then writing up my understanding in a <a href=\"https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2021/07/large_sets_13.html\">series of blog posts</a>. The first one <a href=\"https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2021/06/large_sets_1.html\">begins like this</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My primary interest is not actually in large cardinals themselves. What I'm really interested in is exploring the hypothesis that everything in traditional, membership-based set theory that's relevant to the rest of mathematics can be done smoothly in categorical set theory. I'm not sure this hypothesis is correct (and I suppose no one could ever be sure), which is why I use the words \"hypothesis\" and \"explore\". But I know of no counterexample.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm well aware that everything covered in that series would be regarded as utterly basic by a set theorist, but that was as much as I had the energy to learn (and 13 posts seemed like enough). It would be excellent if someone else, ideally someone with a more suitable background than me, took it further.</p>\n<p>About L specifically: I do think it would be great to have a structural account of L -- or a really compelling explanation of why that's impossible. And I do think it's a major gap that we don't have either already. So, I'm glad to see the conversation between you and Mike. It could be that there's a structural account of L that's much more than a mere translation of standard material, involving some new angle or thought-provoking new idea. Obviously I don't know. But I'm open to the possibility.</p>\n<p>What I find least convincing in your argument is the part about the passage of time. It seems to me that it's quite common in mathematics that something could have been done decades ago and hasn't been. For instance, the course on ETCS I'm about to write could have been done 50 years ago. But as far as I know, it'll be a first.</p>\n<p>We can speculate on the reasons why ETCS has been widely misunderstood and, arguably, underdeveloped. Some of the responsibility probably lies with category theorists for not communicating well enough with the rest of the world. Another reason is that if anyone was to have found a categorical account of L (for example), it would probably have been topos theorists -- but topos theorists tend to be interested in other things. To them, an ETCS category is a very, very special kind of topos, and usually their attention is on a much more general context.</p>\n<p>Over the last year or two, I've asked several category theorists about L, or more specifically about the status of the result that GCH is consistent with ETCS. One distinguished topos theorist gave me the impression that they didn't regard it as an interesting question. I do! Of course, everyone's free to find any topic uninteresting, and that's different from saying something's unimportant or not worthwhile. (I can't honestly claim cancer research as an interest of mine, but I'm very glad it's being done.)  If this topos theorist's attitude is at all representative, that does begin to suggest why the question of a categorical account of L hasn't received much attention. There's just a difference in what people find interesting.</p>\n<p>There's also the matter of incentives. Many mathematicians have lamented that our academic system doesn't give enough reward to people who find new ways of looking at old results. It's too winner-takes-all. Suppose, for instance, that someone wanted to embark on the project of taking Shelah's massive body of work on pcf theory and trying to do it structurally. It would require a huge investment of time, and what would the reward be? Just about the <em>best</em> case: they succeed, set theorists say \"we knew all that already\", and hiring committees say \"they haven't proved anything new\". Maybe that's a slight exaggeration: it could be that new light is genuinely shed, as in the categorical approach to forcing. But hopefully you see my point: it would be a very risky venture in terms of career.</p>\n<p>There's more to say, but I don't want to ramble on forever, so I'll leave it there for now. Thanks for the conversation so far.</p>",

The tentative chapter/week headings are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Introduction</li>\n<li>The axioms, part one</li>\n<li>The axioms, part two</li>\n<li>Subsets</li>\n<li>Relations</li>\n<li>Coproducts and families</li>\n<li>Number systems</li>\n<li>Well-ordered sets</li>\n<li>The axiom of choice</li>\n<li>Cardinal arithmetic.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I'm really excited to be teaching this course, because as far as I know, nothing like it has ever been done before.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Is there a rationale for not including the axiom of replacement in the set theory? Plenty of mathematics uses replacement - for example, Peter Scholze has said that some of the theorems from condensed mathematics aren't provable without replacement. In addition I believe that Lawvere's original paper on ETCS talks about the axiom of replacement.</p>",

What new light is actually shed on forcing by the categorical perspective, especially in the context of Boolean toposes? This is a really common piece of rhetoric coming from category theorists and I'm not really all that convinced by it. While it is true that in the context of toposes forcing generalizes significantly to the broader notion of sheaf toposes, this generalization is seemingly orthogonal to what classical mathematical logicians do with forcing and doesn't seem to shed all that much light on other directions of generalization, such as priority arguments in computability theory.</p>",

In more than one model theory talk I've been in in the last couple of years, I have found myself thinking 'wouldn't this be a lot easier to phrase as a functor?' I've actually been spending a fair amount of time trying to think of applications of category theory in classical model theory; although honestly I still haven't come up with much yet.</p>\n<p>I am, however, saying that just because something <em>can</em> be phrased in categorical language doesn't make the categorical perspective automatically more practical or more insightful. It is true that Boolean-valued models are a useful language for proving certain general facts about forcing in set theory, but my impression is that set theorists generally consider the forcing poset perspective to be more practical for actually building forcing notions and reasoning about their behavior, and this has really been my personal experience too.</p>\n<p>As evidence of this preference among set theorists, consider the <em>Handbook of Set Theory Volume 1</em>. My cursory search through the document indicates six instances of the phrase 'Boolean-valued' or 'Boolean-values,' but 98 instances of the phrase 'forcing poset.' On page 32 in the introduction, Kanamori also writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Still, the view of forcing as a way of actually extending models held the reservoir of sense and the promise of discovery, and after Shoenﬁeld popularized an approach to the forcing relation that captured the gist of the Boolean-valued approach, forcing has been generally cast as a matter of partial orders and generic filters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He then goes on to discuss how the Boolean perspective is still valuable in that it motivated a lot of ideas used in the context of forcing posets and is useful for certain kinds of proofs about the relationship between different forcing posets.</p>\n<p>In the context of something like Levy collapse, thinking about a poset of finite partial functions on some set just requires less conceptual overhead than thinking about the Boolean algebra of regular open subsets of a poset of finite partial functions. Admittedly some of this probably has to do with working in a 'fairly degenerate' case (as Mike phrased it earlier), but this is the only case that matters classically and mathematics is full of examples of specialized tools and perspectives for special cases. Moreover, these classical independence results sill establish independence in the wider context of toposes and constructive mathematics. Whenever a statement is proven to be independent of ZFC, it's also automatically shown to be unresolvable in the context of the internal theory of toposes as well. Shelah's theorem about the independence of the Whitehead problem <em>is a stronger theorem</em> because it is phrased in terms of ZFC and not toposes.</p>\n<p>The problem with trying to apply Rota's quote to the context of this conversation is that Boolean-valued models are not a new idea, and they're not even an idea that wholly originated outside of the context of set theory itself. (Boolean-valued models were independently invented by Scott and Solovay. Scott obviously has roots in category theory, but Solovay doesn't.) ETCS and topos theory are also not new ideas. At some point in order to maintain that a more categorical perspective is probably going to be more practical or more insightful <em>in the context of research questions that set theorists care about in particular</em>, you need to explain why working set theorists haven't taken to these more categorical perspectives for the last 50 years despite these ideas being fairly well-known in the field. Some of this could be explained by cultural inertia to be sure, but I do not accept the idea that it is <em>just</em> cultural inertia.</p>",

I was mulling over what to say and then I had to move to another state for my upcoming position.</p>\n<p>The difficulty I'm having is that I feel like you very carefully did not answer the spirit of my question. I certainly could have phrased it in a more precise way, but in my mind my question was not about whether categorical generalizations of things in set theory are interesting or about what language set theorists are merely 'used to thinking in.'</p>\n<p>Part of the problem in my mind is that this whole enterprise (rephrasing set theory in categorical language via ETCS and/or topos theory) started from a place of overt hostility towards existing set theory and existing set theorists. Mac Lane and Lawvere decided that they thought set theory was, for lack of a better term, bad. Mac Lane called set theory 'obsolete' and said that measurable cardinals were 'strange.' Lawvere allegedly called set theory 'Bourgeoisie idealism' at one point.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, here are my contentions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A reasonable summary of Mac Lane and Lawvere's opinion of set theory is something like \"To the extent that set theory has mathematical content, it is better phrased in terms of category theory, and to the extent that set theory is not phrased in terms of category theory, it does not have mathematical content.\" This is very much the vibe I got when I looked at Lawvere's original paper on ETCS, for instance.</li>\n<li>(This is the part that is the most difficult to litigate, but I do think it is important.) Mac Lane and Lawvere's attitude still permeates a lot of the discourse around set theory, especially in the more purely categorical parts of mathematics. If you look at the <a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/nPOV\">nPOV article on nLab</a>, for instance, it proposes the frankly embarrassingly grandiose claim \"that higher algebra, homotopy theory, type theory, and/or category theory is the right language to describe the world, or at least the world of mathematical ideas.\" (Incidentally, I can't help but be reminded of Tom's comment about 'grand claims' about the 'special role of ZFC.' In my mind this quote from nLab is at least one hundred times more grand than <em>anything</em> I've ever heard a set theorist say about ZFC. I've never seen a set theorist claim that set theory has a uniquely special role in describing <em>the actual physical world</em>.) I think that a fairly direct corollary of such a strong claim is that set theorists (who are not in the habit of using any of the mathematics on that list) are not using the 'right language' to describe whatever 'mathematical ideas' they're thinking about. In any case, this corollary is basically how I summarized Mac Lane and Lawvere's opinion, so I feel at least a bit confident in saying that their dismissive attitude is still somewhat present.</li>\n<li>Mac Lane and Lawvere's opinion has not been borne out by history. Nobody has yet been able to come up with a satisfactory categorical account of things like Gödel's L and the proof of the relative consistency of choice, which are really just the very tip of the iceberg of set theory research.</li>\n<li>Even if someone were to come up with a satisfactory account of these things today, the fact that translating this basic set-theoretic result with an existing proof took <em>decades</em> is in fact conclusive evidence that Mac Lane and Lawvere were just wrong about set theory. It's not just that set theorists are 'used to thinking in <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mo>∈</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\in</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.5782em;vertical-align:-0.0391em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">∈</span></span></span></span>'s'; category theory simply has not demonstrated itself to be a natural language for describing the part of the world of mathematics that set theorists have investigated and are investigating (and the rest of the nPOV--higher algebra, homotopy theory, and type theory--has seemingly not helped in this regard either).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So really, here is my question: Do you agree with me? Do you agree that, on the particular topic of set theory, Saunders Mac Lane and William Lawvere were wrong?</p>",

Although we don’t want to offend people unnecessarily, we are also not ashamed about writing from this particular point of view. <em>There are certainly other valid points of view on mathematics</em>, but describing them and being neutral towards them is not the purpose of the nLab. Rather, the nLab starts from the premise that higher algebra, homotopy theory, type theory, category theory and higher category theory are <em>a true and useful point of view</em>, and one of its aims is to expose this point of view generally and in a multitude of examples, and thereby accumulate evidence for it.</p>\n<p>If you feel skeptical about the n-point of view, you may want to ignore the nLab. Or you may want to take its content as a contribution to a discussion on what is behind the claim that higher algebra, homotopy theory, type theory, and/or category theory is the right language to describe the world, or at least the world of mathematical ideas.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In particular, among the phrases I emphasized there are three indefinite articles, to contrast with the single definite article in the phrase you quoted, not to speak of the explicit acknowledgment that there are \"certainly\" other valid points of view on mathematics.  And even the phrase you quoted, when read in context, doesn't directly <em>make</em> the claim that these subjects are \"the right language\" to describe the world.  I do agree, now that you bring it to my attention, that this particular phrase is overly broad; but I think that in the context of the entire three paragraphs, it should be clear that the nLab is acknowledging the nPOV as only one among many points of view, but just the one that we are choosing to explore here.</p>",

Furthermore, even if many people take a long time to prove a result, I think the naturality of the language should be judged by the eventual outcome, viz. the proof itself. A proof of a known result in a new language might require fundamentally new ideas that lead to an entirely new perspective on the problem, which I believe <em>could</em> justify claims that the language is natural.</p>\n<p>(I should say that I'm not making a claim either way about naturality, just that I don't think it's reasonable to judge by this metric.)</p>",

I can only find one paragraph in his ETCS paper that says anything relevant to this question, but here it is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...these developments partially support the thesis that even in set theory and elementary mathematics it is also true as has long been felt in advanced algebra and topology, namely that the substance of mathematics resides not in Substance (as it is made to seem when ∈ is the irreducible predicate, with the accompanying necessity of deﬁning all concepts in terms of a rigid elementhood relation) but in Form (as is clear when the guiding notion is isomorphism-invariant structure, as deﬁned, for example, by universal mapping properties). As in algebra and topology, here again the concrete technical machinery for the precise expression and eﬃcient handling of these ideas is provided by the Eilenberg-Mac Lane theory of categories, functors, and natural transformations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is not too far from your summary (1), but I still think there are important differences.  Lawvere doesn't say that if set theory isn't phrased in terms of category theory it has no content.  Rather, it seems to me he's saying that <em>because</em> set theory <em>does</em> have mathematical content, if set theory could only be phrased in terms of <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mo>∈</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\in</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.5782em;vertical-align:-0.0391em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">∈</span></span></span></span>, that would give the impression that \"the substance of mathematics resides in Substance\" (whatever that means); but because he's now shown that set theory can also be phrased in terms of category theory, we are not forced to draw that conclusion.</p>\n<p>However, Lawvere does claim here that the substance of mathematics resides <em>not</em> in Substance <em>but</em> in Form.  I think at most, ETCS supports the claim that even in set theory, the substance of mathematics <em>could</em> reside in Form <em>in addition to</em> Substance, since it is an alternative to <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mo>∈</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\in</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.5782em;vertical-align:-0.0391em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">∈</span></span></span></span>-based theories and in no way \"invalidates\" them.  And I do also get the impression from other writings that Lawvere had an overly optimistic view of the capabilities of categorical set theory vis-a-vis classical set theory research.  So on that, I do agree with you.  (Although I also agree with Nathanael's response to your point (4).)</p>",

While it is true that some weak predicative type theories have purely proof-theoretic consistency proofs, stronger impredicative or classical type theories don't. On the other hand, there are several <em>predicative</em> set theories, such as KP and CZF, that are weak enough to have proof-theoretic consistency proofs. And while it's true that CZF was (if I recall correctly) motivated by a type-theoretic construction, Kripke-Platek set theory was not (and KP is about a decade older than MLTT for that matter).</p>",

It was great, and I think it's fair to say that I have a very favorable view of classical set theory compared to most of my peers (and superiors) here.</p>\n<p>However, I find the attribution of the employment struggles of set theorists to the criticisms from category theorists or type theorists so weird that it quickly erodes all my empathy.</p>\n<p>Securing a position in a mathematics department when specializing in foundations is very very challenging, with little to no advantage whether one focuses on set theory or type theory. In fact, if you want to work in a math department, being a set theorist is downright easy mode compared to, say, a structural proof theorist; and I think even a type theorist.</p>\n<p>If polemics by type theorists had any serious impact on the job prospects of set theorists, I would expect to see the following: <em>the few schools of mathematics which employ type theorists would be the ones to have the fewest set theorists</em>.</p>\n<p>In reality, I see the exact opposite. I had a hard time naming a single school of mathematics which employs type theorists but not set theorists (in the end I could think of an otherwise unremarkable institution in Eastern Europe, which employs 2 type theorists in total). The converse was trivially easy: take the Einstein Institute / HUJI.</p>\n<p>Truth is, most departments prefer candidates with expertise in core areas like algebra, combinatorics, differential equations, geometry, or number theory, which impacts hiring decisions 1000x more than any academic debate between niche fields ever could. And even if criticism from type theorists somehow factored into these decision (which I don't believe at all!), that would not in itself be reason for them to tone their criticisms down: after all, if these polemical category/type theorists _were_ right in their assertion that something is wrong with set theory (which I don't think they are), then it _would be_ the right move for math departments to hire fewer set theorists. But it's not like set theorists had an easier time finding positions before the IAS year on HoTT: practitioners of the core areas had a dim view of foundational research for at least the last 30 years.</p>\n<p>(I also fail to see where set theory and type theory are competing for the same funding sources, but I'm only familiar with the funding situation in my country, Australia, and, well, it's not great for either field here at the moment, or even for the core areas)</p>",

All one needs to do is consider the Dedekind reals or the MacNeille reals and look at the smallest Cauchy-closed subfield containing the rationals. This means that the following claim on Page 14  (of hott-ebook-13-g2e736d1.pdf) is in my mind dubious:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In set-theoretic foundations, the definition of the real numbers as equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences requires either the law of excluded middle or the axiom of (countable) choice to be well-behaved. But with higher inductive types, we can give a version of this definition which is well-behaved and avoids any choice principles; see Chapter 11.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In particular, this is a slightly disingenuous statement because it's saying that <em>one particular</em> definition of the Cauchy reals is poorly behaved constructively, but a <em>different definition</em> that <em>can also be done equivalently in comparable constructive set theories</em> is well-behaved. (The other issue of course is just that constructive mathematicians preferred and still prefer the definition of the reals in terms of Dedekind cuts over any of the definitions in terms of Cauchy sequences.)</p>\n<p>The general point of course is that you can do quotient-inductive types in something like IZF if you know a size bound on the resulting set ahead of time (something like a surjection from a subset of a given set).</p>\n<p>Honestly, given the fact that two of the four bullet points comparing HoTT to set theory <em>introduction of the book</em> are pretty arguably wrong or at the very least misleading, I don't really feel confident in the accuracy of statements about set theory made in the rest of the book.</p>",

This is obviously a lot more crass of a way of approaching computation than a practical type theory, but it's something that I've actually spent a fair amount of time thinking about in my own research on computational content in constructive set theory.</p>\n<p>The obnoxious aspect of the quote is that it's <em>very</em> hard for me to not read it as implying that the axioms of set theory are merely 'arbitrary,' which I would hope you would agree is not in fact true. On the other hand, as we've already discussed, even type theories with computational content can have a fair amount of arbitrariness (such as Agda's second type universe hierarchy, which has some odd 'artificial' restrictions, such as not being able to form lists).</p>",

These are of course problems with literally trying to write machine code in RISC-V, but <em>you're not supposed to actually do that</em>. </p>\n<p>So given that, why don't we build processors that run Haskell or OCaml on bare metal? There are a couple of obvious reasons, but mostly it's because it's too complicated. Intel has had problems in the past with <em>just</em> implementing IEEE floating point arithmetic correctly on their chips (which is part of the reason they funded the development of HOL Light); are they really supposed to be trying to implement Haskell's IO monad correctly <em>on bare metal</em> when the developers of Haskell themselves got it wrong at one point? No, obviously not. There's a practical reason for the stratification into low-level, austere, untyped machine code and high-level, fully featured, strongly typed programming language.</p>\n<p>The promise of set theory was always that it was a simple framework in which it is <em>in principle possible</em> to <em>encode</em> mathematics. The benefit of this simplicity is supposed to be that semantics and syntax are easier to reason about, which means that we can (1) be more philosophically confident in the semantic coherence and therefore probable consistency of the theory, (2) be more able to easily build models of the theory and therefore prove independence results, and (3) have an easier time internalizing syntax.</p>\n<p>I would argue that set theory (or as I've recently taken to calling it, set theory plus first-order logic) has succeeded in all three of these points significantly over and above type theory:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Type theory has an objectively worse track record relative to set theory with regards to accidentally writing down theories that are later found to be inconsistent. Martin-Löf originally wrote down a type theory that was inconsistent because of essentially Russell's paradox, despite the fact that at that point Russell's paradox was more than 70 years old and despite the fact that type theory was basically <em>invented</em> by Russell and Whitehead precisely to deal with Russell's paradox. <a href=\"https://github.com/agda/agda/issues/1556\">Agda is widely suspect *right now* of being inconsistent because of issues involving 'very dependent types,' which are hard to reason about semantically (cf. \"which makes my head hurt if I think too hard about it\").</a> This is despite the fact that Agda is supposed to be the kind of low-consistency-strength predicative type theory that enjoys the virtue of being consistent on the basis of proof theory alone, as was mentioned in the HoTT book. Similarly, my understanding is that inconsistencies in Coq keep popping up because people keep wanting to add more expressiveness to the kernel. This doesn't really feel like the right 'philosophical' approach to what a kernel is supposed to be, but it feels to me like this is inevitable in a type-theoretic approach where what arguably should be 'syntactic sugar' is required to be baked into the fundamental system and therefore the kernel.</li>\n<li>Set theoretic metamathematics (in terms of model building specifically) is miles beyond what has been currently accomplished with type theory. Despite the fact that forcing is one of the things that naturally fits into the \"nPOV,\" my understanding is that there really hasn't been that much development of forcing in the context of type theory. Moreover, I'm under the impression that even defining forcing over HoTT is still something of an active research problem. Contrast this with encyclopedic works on set-theoretic independence results, such as Howard and Rubin's <em>Consequences of the Axiom of Choice</em>. Things like class forcing and inner models don't even seem to be on the radar of most of type-theoretic metamathematics.</li>\n<li>Gödel was able to effectively internalize the syntax of FOL in the 30s. This work (or rather modern revisions of it) is routinely presented in introductory graduate and undergraduate mathematical logic courses. Contrast this with the famous and amusingly titled 2008 type theory paper <em><a href=\"https://jmchapman.io/papers/lfmtp08_jmc.pdf\">Type Theory should eat itself</a></em> by Chapman, which starts its introduction with \"This work is a small step towards the long-term goal of the author and many others to internalise the syntax and semantics of recent formulations of type theory.\"</li>\n</ol>\n<p>My problem with the junk theorem arguments that people put forward is that they don't address this side of the issue <em>at all</em>.

But that isn't what the quote says: it says that set-theoretic axioms <em>can</em> be chosen arbitrarily.  In other words, you can write down an arbitrary collection of axioms about <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mo>∈</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\in</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.5782em;vertical-align:-0.0391em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">∈</span></span></span></span> and get a first-order theory, whereas you cannot write down an arbitrary collection of rules and have a \"type theory\" in the computational sense.</p>\n<p>As you say, if you posit that you want your set theory to be constructive, in the sense of the disjunction and existence properties, then that places restrictions on the axioms you can assume.

And yes, there is a difference between being constructive and being a programming language.  The disjunction and existence properties are a <em>consequence</em> of the computational properties of type theory; we don't need to start out by desiring them.  And the computational behavior of type theory (sans axioms) is necessary for practical implementations of it, in contrast to implementations of set theory where I would expect it suffices to have a \"computational\" interpretation of the underlying first-order logic.</p>",

I especially wanted to get rid of the top and bottom margins, because I project the notes up during classes, and those margins are a pain when something begins at the bottom of one page and continues at the top of the next. All I remember about this experiment is that I abandoned it very quickly. I forgot why - maybe it broke the hyperlinks? Probably there's some cropping tool that doesn't, but this wasn't enough of a problem to me that I felt motivated to solve it.</p>",

href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/us/universitypress/subjects/mathematics/logic-categories-and-sets/basic-category-theory\">Here is the book's page on the official Cambridge University Press shop.</a> What does it say about the dimensions of the book?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Product details</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Date Published: September 2014</li>\n<li>format: Hardback</li>\n<li>isbn:

href=\"https://assets.cambridge.org/97811070/44241/index/9781107044241_index.pdf\">say this one</a>)</em>, we confirm that pages are about 228 × 152 millimetres in size <em>(so they sink by a few millimetres below the edge of the hard cover)</em>. <strong>This is the American Royal paper size.</strong></p>\n<h4>conclusion</h4>\n<p>Tom, <strong>you have been misled</strong>. In fact, Cambridge University Press did not publish your book in the same paper size as the style they have given you suggests. Observe however that page layout is very nearly the same between the printed and arXiv version — they only cropped the margins.</p>\n<h4>but anyway</h4>\n<p>What use cases are you aiming to support?</p>\n<p>We have found 4 use cases so far:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>reading on computer screen</li>\n<li>reading on a printout</li>\n<li>reading in a book</li>\n<li>reading on projector screen</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of these only <em>«reading in a book»</em> seems to require wide margins to be provided at type setting stage, for scribbling. But on this use case Cambridge University Press has already let you down. If you want to have wide margins on a printout, it is easily accomplished by setting 80% scale in page setup, so this use case does not need any special support at type setting stage. At the same time, narrower margins are more cost effective since you can more easily squeeze two or even four pages on one A4 page to be printed out. On screen, scribbling does not seem to be a prominent use case since most software do not support it. In any case, to allow for liberal scribbling, a wide <em>front</em> margin is enough — there is no need to make all four margins unusually wide.</p>\n<p>As we can now see, <strong>cropping the margins of a PDF file is not a trivial task</strong>. Firstly, you have to come up with good looking geometry — by trial and error. Then, there are problems along the way, like dying hyperlinks and outline. Among the four persons who said something about it <em>(me, you, Mike and Matteo)</em> we have exactly zero reproducible cases of success reported. This is where <strong>your support as a type setter is needed</strong>.</p>\n<p>The wide margins of the arXiv version of <em>Basic Category Theory</em> and of the current PDF version of <em>Axiomatic Set Theory</em> are anything but common in type setting. If you know for sure that most of your readers are best served with wide margins on all sides, then of course you should go with wide margins. It would be surprising for me to learn that this is so — I cannot recall any printed book that would have had such wide margins on all sides nor any style guide that would call for it.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"277067\">Tom Leinster</span> <a

available is the comments, to which I answered that you may try to remove comments automatically. I understand that there are other edits you will need to make before you see the book as <em>«done»</em>. But maybe you can be persuaded to remove comments and then publish the source code <em>provisionally</em>? There is some advantage to having a sparrow in your hand while waiting for a crane in the sky to become available.</p>",

We would like to create a mathematical culture in which it is relatively painless for experts to do the <em>free labor</em> of sharing their course notes with the rest of the world, who unlike their students or institutions do not pay for the use of their time and expertise. If the expectation is that anyone who publishes their notes is expected to either publish the source---which is often messy, unreadable, and whose publication is not a standard in any field of publishing in the world---or to publish new versions of the pdf catering to the formatting preferences of everyone who sends them a message, then I think you will quickly find that people stop publicly advertising their notes in the first place. (Or they stop participating in forums like this Zulip.)</p>\n<p>As a student growing up now, (despite everything that's horrible about academia these days) I feel really lucky to live in a time where I can access world-class exposition and research, from my laptop in a coffee shop, as it is being published.
