This is clearly way too ambitious and definitely wouldn't come out very good. I then considered writing an intro to category theory which assumes very little. I'm now of the opinion that a much better approach is to write a bunch of smaller books which are \"Intro to X\", but which simply introduces categorical language as it goes. It has the sneaky side-effect of side-stepping the ct haters. I also don't like the idea of giant tomes. They could only possibly be off-putting to beginners.</p>",
