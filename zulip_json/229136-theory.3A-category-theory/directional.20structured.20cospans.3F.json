They define it using the Borisov-Manin category of graphs by restricting the objects to be disjoint unions of corollas. This is a bit intricate, mostly because the Borisov-Manin category is very ad hoc.</p>\n<p>The point is that in the BM category, every morphism factors as a grafting followed by a compression, so in the KW category, the arrows can be described as being grafting-followed-by-compression, where the end objects are disjoint unions of corollas but the middle object is allowed to be a general graph.</p>\n<p>Now by a theorem of mine [Cospan construction of the graph category of Borisov and Manin, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.10342]\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.10342]</a> the BM category is the category of cospans in the Joyal-Kock category of graphs in which the right leg is active and the left leg is inert (generic and free in the original terminology). Now the BM graftings correspond to JK inert maps, and the BM compressions correspond to JK active maps backwards, and altogether the BM category is the JK category with the active maps 'reversed', so that the grafting-followed-by-compression become inert-active cospans.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, the Kaufmann-Ward Feynman category of graphs is the directional structured cospan category obtained from the JK category by taking inert-active cospans and allowing only disjoint-unions-of-corollas as 'feet'. This is an example of structured cospans via the inclusion of disjoint-unions-of-corollas into the category if all graphs.

In any case, that's a very cool paper!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, one thing I have thought about is that there is a certain condition regarding the factorization of monics which allows one to glue a (structured) partial map  category with its opposite, up to structured spans of monics in order to obtain the full structured span category.</p>",

In our case, this amounts to constructing free Markov categories (more precisely, actually free <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00322\">CD categories</a>) as subcategories of the corresponding <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09495\">free hypergraph categories</a>.</p>",
