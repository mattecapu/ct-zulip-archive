But now, over the past few years, Simon Henry has made important inroads to the theory, and proved a version of the conjecture. His approach follows the KV idea, but uses a lot of modern machinery.

But it is if one disallows length 0, which turns the “non-zero Moore loop space” into a weakly unital, strictly associative monoid.</p>",

Trying to make them algebraic and choosing a filler for every inner horn breaks this, and there is no quasicategory with choice of fillers?</p>",
