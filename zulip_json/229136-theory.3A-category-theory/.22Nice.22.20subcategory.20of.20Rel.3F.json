Do you think you could spell this out in some further detail?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>First, convince yourself that the symmetric monoidal catgory of finite ordinals and functions under the monoidal product + is classified by the prop of  commutative monoids.  That is, this category is generated by the free commutative monoid on the one object set under direct sum.  Let us take a detour through spans before we talk about rel.  How can we glue two copies of finite sets and functions  to get finite spans of functions? The usual way is to consider the category induced by the (almost) distributive law given by pulling back functions, which allows us to turn cospans into spans.  This distributive law, at the level of monoids, turns out to be given by the equations of a bi-commutative bialgebra. My intuition is, because one can think of spans as matrices over the natural numbers: the comonoid is copying, and the monoid is addition.  The counit of copying is deleting and the unit of addition is 0.  One can verify that copying and addition over <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"double-struck\">N</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathbb N</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.68889em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathbb\">N</span></span></span></span> forms a bialgebra.  To get from spans to Rel, one has to take a quotient; think of this as taking you from natural number matrices to matrices over the Boolean semiring.  This quotient is precisely asserting that copying and then adding is the identity.  So we have to add one more equation to the equations of a bicommutative bialgebra, ``specialness'', to express the equation 1+1=1 in Bool.</p>\n<p>This is discussed in further detail in Lack's paper: <a href=\"http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/13/9/13-09.pdf\" title=\"http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/13/9/13-09.pdf\">http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/13/9/13-09.pdf</a></p>",

        "content": "<p>Thanks. I'll think more about this.</p>\n<p>I should mention that I thought a bit more about things and now I think I have a good counterexample, and also can explain why the factorization in the paper probably doesn't help. Again, all just sort of high-level thoughts. So the counterexample is the inverse of the diagonal map on any set greater than two. I.e. it sends each element to every element except itself. This one I genuinely can't see how to factor as an epi followed by a mono. What the paper lets you do, I think, is give a factorization as a mono followed by an epi, since the key steps are cosurjection followed by surjection, which i as I think of it \"splitting\" (which is mono) followed by \"merging\" (which is epi). You \"pull apart\" each element that lands in multiple places into a copy for each place it lands, and then you remerge the split bits into new things which tell you where they actually land. But just as in set, this is far from unique. You can always \"oversplit\" followed by doing more merging. So even {1} -&gt; {1} can factor a lot of ways with this process, and its still always a mono followed by an epi, and in fact even (i think?) a split mono followed by a split epi. So the paper gives a nice factorization that lets you think of how relations are generated, but it doesn't give a unique factorization.</p>\n<p>Reasoning like the above has me pretty convinced that the \"antidiagonal\" can't factor the other way as an epi followed by a mono at all. </p>\n<p>Which brings me back to the original question, I guess, that Mike asked, which is (in my mind) \"what class of morphisms correspond to the ones that do factor, and can we show that they're closed under composition\".</p>",
