The 𝐹-factorization of the unit of 𝑀 defines a pointed endofunctor 𝑀𝐹:𝐶→𝐶 (returning the object that arises in the factorization).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Under what natural and most general assumptions on 𝑀, 𝐹 (and possibly 𝐶) is 𝑀𝐹an idempotent monad?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>First and foremost, I am interested in the (∞,1)-version of this question, but of course any information about the (1,1) case will be useful and appreciated.</p>\n<p>Is it sufficient to check that the arising natural transformation 𝑀𝐹→𝑀𝐹𝑀𝐹 is an isomorphism? Is there any literature discussing such constructions?</p>\n<p>The closest related discussions I have found on MathOverflow are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://mathoverflow.net/questions/257672/conditions-so-that-a-fs-induces-a-frobenius-adjunction\">Conditions so that a FS induces a Frobenius adjunction</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mathoverflow.net/questions/245663/the-reflection-of-a-reflective-factorization-system\">The reflection of a reflective factorization system</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>as well as the paper <em>Rosický-Tholen, \"Factorization, Fibration, and Torsion\"</em>, mentioned in the second link. However, in these sources:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A very special case is discussed: 𝑀 is a reflector onto a subcategory 1 (terminal object).</li>\n<li>Moreover an unrealistic (for me) condition is imposed on the class 𝐿: the full two-out-of-three property. This does not hold even in the best cases I care about (such as effective epimorphisms (surjections/quotients) in algebraic categories or toposes).</li>\n</ol>",
