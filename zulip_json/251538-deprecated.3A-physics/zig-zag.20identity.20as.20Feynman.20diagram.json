I guess this is nothing new since the nLab cites at least two papers where Feynman diagrams are introduced as graphical calculus for a monoidal category, but I'm posting it anyway because I think it's neat <span aria-label=\"laughing\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f606\" role=\"img\" title=\"laughing\">:laughing:</span> <br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/PYLF8fViECpRfeIZfxB5GtZS/Quick-sheets-page-36.png\">Quick-sheets-page-36.png</a> <br>\nThere is a question, by the way: the identity doesn't look quite right. There's no photon on the right side! Plus, the electron and the photon switch position in the interaction, is this irrelevant o ar Feynman diagrams commutative (as in commutative monoidal, i.e. braiding = 1)?</p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/PYLF8fViECpRfeIZfxB5GtZS/Quick-sheets-page-36.png\" title=\"Quick-sheets-page-36.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/21317/PYLF8fViECpRfeIZfxB5GtZS/Quick-sheets-page-36.png\"></a></div>",
