For example, it's possible the mathematical language for QTF is not available yet (another possibility is that it is, and we have yet to put the proper words together). When we do math, it's not always rigorous and precise at first, but it gets to that stage through some (often serious) effort. QFT is still currently in this stage---the structure of the theory is still not fully understood and is going under revision (and I'm talking about physicists)!

To quote Vladimir  Arnold and his extreme position in one direction, \"Mathematics is the part of physics where experiments are cheap.\" (<a href=\"https://www.uni-muenster.de/Physik.TP/~munsteg/arnold.html\">https://www.uni-muenster.de/Physik.TP/~munsteg/arnold.html</a>). <br>\nI don't agree with Arnold's take in that essay, but still: Maybe a mathematician is just a theoretical physicist cut off from the experimental physicist, free to roam in ever deeper corners of what was once somewhat related to geometry and time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is great.
