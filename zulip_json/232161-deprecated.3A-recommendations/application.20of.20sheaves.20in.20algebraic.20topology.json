I think they expect the reader knows some basic sheaf theory but it is meant more as an introduction to the applications. It is short, not a massive technical treatise, they say in the foreword that the book can be considered as preparation for more technical and in depth treatments such as Kashiwara and Schapira's book Sheaves on Manifolds.<br>\nThe book by Iversen, \"Cohomology of Sheaves\" describes using sheaves in topology to study Poincare duality and its generalizations due to Poincare.

It is one of my favorite books. I cannot really say that it deals too much with \"applications\".
