Briefly, if you want to get something to be a reprint you have to persuade 3 editors. That should be easy to do if it's a good paper (or book) and there are no difficult copyright issues preventing it from being reprinted.  If you don't know enough <a href=\"http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/geninfo.html#edlist\">editors</a> just ask me.</p>\n<p>For a long time Bob Rosebrugh was the editor of TAC and Michael Barr was in charge of their LaTeX.  Now Geoff Crutwell has become editor.   If you want to get involved in this, I suggest emailing him.</p>",
