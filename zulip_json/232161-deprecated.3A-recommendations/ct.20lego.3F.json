One would need a game designer of course to build it up in an interesting way.</p>",

(I associate Escher with maths because of the book <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G√∂del,_Escher,_Bach\">G√∂del, Escher, Bach</a> which I read as a teen but never quite finished reading). My kids loved Monument Valley and so they have now a deep Escher imagination at age 5. Weirdly that game seems to point to those spaces not being impossible as usually thought.<br>\nAnyway, if one could produce mathematical games with that level of artistry, one could get perhaps get children to zoom past the current curriculum.</p>",
