I've been reading Wedhorn's book lately and I like it pretty well. It is my first introduction to locally ringed spaces. (I know the basics of differential geometry but nothing about algebraic geometry.)</p>\n<p>In a ringed space, you have a sheaf on a \"small\" site, the poset of open sets, which tells you the smooth maps <em>out of</em> the space. In a smooth set, you have a sheaf on a \"large\" site, the category of cartesian spaces or even the category of all smooth manifolds, which tells you the smooth maps <em>into</em> your space. On the face of it, both differences seem fairly significant to me. Can you elaborate on why you say smooth sets are a minor modification of locally ringed spaces?</p>",
