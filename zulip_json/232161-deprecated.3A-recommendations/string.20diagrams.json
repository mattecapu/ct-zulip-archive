(Also definitely not beginner resources.)</p>\n<p>I mention this because these made me realise that \"things flowing along wires\" isn't the only way to read a string diagram - there's another way that often makes much more sense. For a diagram that's written top-to-bottom, you have to read <em>across</em> the diagram, from left to right. Start at the top left-hand corner of the diagram and imagine something coming in from the left. Each wire \"does something\" to it as it moves across them, so you end up with something on the right-hand side that's been processed by all the wires.</p>\n<p>Hmm, this is getting hard to describe in words.

(Of course technically this is what the digram represents.)
