(It is also designed to do a lot more, perhaps so big companies can hire cheaper sysadmins…)</p>\n<p>macOS, UNIX, and (much) Linux architecture have different security models.  For example on Macs, the Crowdstrike updates are loaded first in a user space.  So if something goes wrong, the problem is much more likely <em>recoverable</em> because the lowest level of the OS kernel is not (yet) affected.</p>\n<p>Why doesn’t windows do the same?  My understanding is that it’s not possible — there’s not enough designed separation between core functions managed by root/admin and those of the user at a low level — instead these ideas were added <em>after</em>.  (The code base of windows is also literally orders of magnitude larger in lines of code so harder to manage, update, understand… there’s a reason something like 85% of internet servers run some variety of unix)</p>\n<p>So, when you have third party code affecting your kernel, and auto-updating daily, and running at the lowest level it possibly can… you get exactly this kind of issue. :(</p>\n<p>Now Red Hat Enterprise and Ubuntu have been moving in the direction of windows, and Crowdstrike did cause kernel panics on Red Hat Enterprise a few years back. So even if you start from a better designed security model, it’s still possible to screw things up!  I’m not making some kind of “inherent superiority” argument.</p>\n<p>Crowdstrike is the proximate cause of this meltdown.  Poor security models and bloatware are IMO the fundamental causes.  You could say for historical reasons Windows is much more strongly affected by these problems than *nix systems.</p>",
