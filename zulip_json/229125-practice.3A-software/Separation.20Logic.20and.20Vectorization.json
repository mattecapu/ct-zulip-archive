For instance, vectorized AES-XTS generates 8 or <a href=\"https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/d3b6b81eab48c1b8ed4075a1818692f640fea999/crypto/aes/asm/aesni-xts-avx512.pl#L1372-L1395\">16 tweaks ahead of time</a> before it parallelizes the AES encrypt stepâ€”is there a way to generalize/formalize this type of optimization systematically? This implementation was done intuitively, but having a formal way of thinking about this could go a very long way!</p>",
