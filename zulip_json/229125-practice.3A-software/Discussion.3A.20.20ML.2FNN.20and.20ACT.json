This innovative approach encapsulates the diverse landscape of neural network designs, including recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and offers a new lens to understand and develop deep learning architectures. By applying category theory, the research captures the constraints used in Geometric Deep Learning (GDL) and extends beyond to a wider array of neural network architectures.\"</p>",

My background is in Computer Science and Business applications of technology, primarily for profit (Return on Investment/ROI).  My experience is fairly broad and deep, implementing technologies earlier than most by finding how they could connect to profitability earlier.  I \"think\" there are profitable business application for Category Theory and was trying to start a conversation with the purpose of learning more about Category Theory while trying to connect the dots to ROI.<br>\nWhile ROI tends to distract from some research in a technology it often brings funding that otherwise would never happen.<br>\nRegarding the paper, maybe <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"276875\">@Bruno GavranoviÄ‡</span> would help the discussion.<br>\nDo you think that the application of Category Theory would help enhance the \"exploitability\" of Neural Networks, or of AI in general?</p>",

        "content": "<p>I think category theory should be very helpful, but it's important to keep in mind that category theory is a very general, abstract set of ideas and principles.  So, to apply it to any particular problem you have to either hope that someone has already successfully applied it to something quite similar, or be prepared to put in a lot of work.   In the latter case you need a team including experts on the problem and experts on category theory, and they need to talk to each other a lot. </p>\n<p>I know this because I've been working for about 14 years to apply category theory to modeling, and though I managed to make a lot of progress laying the foundations with some grad students and other mathematicians, the project really took off around 4 years ago when I teamed up with a group of epidemiologists and computer scientists, most of whom know quite a bit of category theory.   We are now writing software for epidemiological modeling based on category theory, and it's quite exciting.</p>",

        "content": "<p>The paper you point to was written by a team of people working for a company, Symbolica, that has now gotten about $30 million in startup funds to develop a new approach to machine learning.    Much of the paper is an introduction to category theory.   It's not the case that anyone can just read that paper, take the time to understand it in detail, and then rapidly start applying category theory to machine learning.    The paper is not a recipe for machine learning: it's a sketch of a plan.   So I expect this team will need to work at least a year or two, and maybe longer, before getting commercially applicable results.   Luckily some of these people know a lot of category theory.  I believe others are experts on machine learning.   Anyway, that kind of mix is what's required to make progress.</p>",
