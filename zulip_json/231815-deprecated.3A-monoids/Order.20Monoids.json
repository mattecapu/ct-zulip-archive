If, at the end of this discarding, there was still not a unique parse, then I would fail parsing, but so far I haven't seen an instance of that happen: The assumption is that parse ambiguity is roughly compositional, so if there are two ambiguous rules that can both individually trigger on the same string, there should be a case where both of their preferred parsings were found.</p>",
