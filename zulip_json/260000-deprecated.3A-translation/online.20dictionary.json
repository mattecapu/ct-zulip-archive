On the latter side, I've written some small things about a categorical approach to the problem, but on the former side, I've been trying to compile a multilingual maths dictionary. At the moment it's not very full at all, but I've been getting some submissions recently, and it's growing ever so slowly. I've spent a day or so trying to get the web interface to view it to work nicely, and now it's bearable at least, so feel free to have a look! <a href=\"https://thosgood.com/maths-dictionary/\">https://thosgood.com/maths-dictionary/</a></p>",
