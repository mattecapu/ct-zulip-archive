This is sometimes called the <strong>Sinh invariant</strong>.   It comes from the associator, which gives a 3-cocycle thanks to the pentagon identity.  Replacing the Gr-category by a monoidally equivalent one changes this 3-cocycle by a cohomologous one, so the Sinh invariant is a cohomology class.</p>\n<p>The Wikipedia article on her calls Hoàng Xuân Sính \"the first female mathematician in Vietnam\".  I don't know how certain that is, but her story is certainly interesting:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The French mathematician and pacifist Alexander Grothendieck visited North Vietnam in late 1967, during the Vietnam War, and spent a month teaching mathematics to the Hanoi University mathematics department staff, including Hoàng, who took the notes for the lectures. Because of the war, Grothendieck's lectures were held away from Hanoi, first in the nearby countryside and later in Đại Từ. After Grothendieck returned to France, he continued to teach Hoàng as a correspondence student. She earned her doctorate under Grothendieck's supervision from Paris Diderot University in 1975, with a handwritten thesis. Her thesis research, on algebraic structures based on categorical groups but with a group law that holds only up to isomorphism, prefigured much of the modern theory of 2-groups.</p>\n</blockquote>",
