I see in your statements of values and conduct and general practices not so much an adversarial game (altho I do understand why y'all like them theoretically) but a lot of cooperation.</p>\n<p>And the economic elements arrive in the positions topic and the constant discussions of PHD programs and also the applications in economics, industry, and government.</p>\n<p>Here's that blog post: <a href=\"https://write.as/economic-networks/visual-languages-resource-flow-diagrams\">https://write.as/economic-networks/visual-languages-resource-flow-diagrams</a></p>\n<p>It's still editable by me, so if anybody wants anything changed, I'm on it...</p>",
