Looks like a lot of people here are thinking of economics in terms of competitive markets with adversarial relationships.

If I understand correctly, an economic network would be an example of the maximally cooperative version of the prisoner's dilemma. If and when any of the participants gets greedy, either the other participants will discipline them or the network will fall apart.</p>\n<p>Here's an example that I helped to organize: <a href=\"http://www.fifthseasoncoop.com/\">http://www.fifthseasoncoop.com/</a> </p>\n<p>It's a multi-stakeholder cooperative of farmers, food processors, distributors, and institutions (schools and hospitals). </p>\n<p>I've helped to organize several of these things. A couple failed because of greedy or otherwise non-cooperative dominant participants.</p>\n<p>By the way, most manufacturing supply chains are more like cooperative networks than market players internally. I worked in auto supply chains for several years and they work by negotiated long-term relationships, they don't go out on the market looking for components.</p>",

We are using open games and my software implementation of them to build models of things along these lines. One thing we're looking at is governance of common pool resources along the lines of Ostrom. We're in the process of exploring what open games can do and how they could be useful to practitioners. They certainly allow you to do rapid prototyping of models. (A major drawback is that open games are inherently equilibrium-based, and quite often you just don't care about equilibria)</p>",

These en-<br>\nterprise networks are often formed to realise a single customersâ€™ order and play an important role<br>\nduring the conceptual phase (product design) as well as during the realization phase (produc-<br>\ntion).<br>\nThe research unit IKAP prepares, develops and realises methods and tools to support coopera-<br>\ntive, inter-organizational enterprise networks.
