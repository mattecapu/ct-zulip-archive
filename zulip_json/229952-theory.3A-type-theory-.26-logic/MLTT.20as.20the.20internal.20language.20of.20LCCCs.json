As I understand it, Seely's original paper has a flaw in that substitution in types may not be interpreted correctly by pullback, as pullbacks are not strict. This was later rectified in several ways, culminating in Clairambault–Dybjer's proof of biequivalence. Let's consider for a moment finitely complete categories, which correspond to MLTT without Pi types. Every finitely complete category is equivalent to a strict finitely complete category (in which pullbacks are strictly associative), by a result of Freyd–Scedrov. If the only issue with Seely's proof is this nonassociativity of pullbacks (Hoffman mentions an issue with Sigma types, but as far as I can tell, these are related), then can't we just consider strict finitely complete categories, which are equivalent to arbitrary finitely complete categories, and get a correct proof of sound and complete equivalence by Seely's result? When we work in the internal language, we just care about things up to equivalence in any case.<br>\nThis is surely <em>not</em> the case, but I don't know where the flaw in my reasoning lies. Could someone enlighten me?</p>",
