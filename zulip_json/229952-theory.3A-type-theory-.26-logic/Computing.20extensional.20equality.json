        "content": "<p>Hi folks, I'm interested in the problem of computing whether two functions are extensionally equal. I don't know much type theory, so I'm trying to establish an intuition about the problem, and what is possible.</p>\n<p>I know that the problem is undecidable for Turing-complete programming languages, but I'm not interested in those. I'm interested in suitably restricted languages. In particular, I'm interested in (purely functional) languages that include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>first-class functions</li>\n<li>sum types and product types</li>\n<li>branching and pattern-matching</li>\n<li>integer arithmetic<ul>\n<li>Assume the standard integer operations are built-in, and that they obey all the standard laws of arithmetic.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But (perhaps unconventionally), I only want to consider languages <strong>without</strong> inductive/recursive types. (Integers are built-in, so they need not be treated as an inductive type.) I've recently been considering alternative approaches to structuring data wherein functions also fulfil the role of finite maps (a.k.a. dictionaries, associative arrays...), and I believe this can serve as an adequate alternative to inductive types for an everyday programming language. (Lookups would be statically-checked.)</p>\n<p>As for recursive functions, they might exist in a very constrained form, or be banned entirely. (Is it reasonable to have this discussion without establishing what kind of recursion is permitted?)</p>\n<p>So, back to our problem: determining <strong>extensional equality</strong> of functions. Thinking about this for a while, I've noticed there are actually several related problems:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Computing a \"canonical form\" for a function<ul>\n<li>This one seems tricky: the process might need to include all kinds of elaborate manipulations, e.g. factorization and expansion of polynomial expressions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Computing a canonical \"identifier\" for a function (two functions share the identifier iff they are extensionally equal)<ul>\n<li>Perhaps this is an easier problem? The identifier need not contain all the information required to (efficiently) reconstruct the function definition itself.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Testing two functions for extensional equality<ul>\n<li>This is an easier problem than the above problems, since equality testing is trivial if you have canonical forms/identifiers. But perhaps there are other methods to test equality that are more practical (and more decidable) than computing canonical forms/identifiers.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My questions include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How feasible is it to solve any of these problems in a suitably constrained language such as the one I described earlier?</li>\n<li>What is the most powerful language in which extensional equality is decidable? Has this been established?</li>\n<li>Are there some good resources for learning the basics of all this?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I've been utterly entranced by this problem lately. I've stumbled onto type-theoretic discussions about extensional equality such as the recent buzz around cubical type theory, but:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The design of these type systems seems to be centered around inductive types, which I'm not very interested in. Perhaps all the relevant facts and motivations no longer apply in the absence of inductive types?</li>\n<li>From what I can tell, the idea seems to be that the programmer has to <strong>manually prove</strong> extensional equality of functions (by computing some kind of \"path\"). There's no built-in true/false test? That doesn't seem like the approach to equality you'd want in a general-purpose programming language.</li>\n</ul>",
