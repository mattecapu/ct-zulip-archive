        "content": "<p>Hi Max, I think they're usually called relevant and affine monads, already in Bart Jacobs' Semantics of Weakening and Contraction, where there's more discussion of the history. Bart and others have written more about it since too, of course. <br>\nAn affine theory is one where f(x,x,x...) = x for all f. These are sometimes called \"modes\", and include the theory of convex sets.<br>\nIn programming languages we also talk about \"discardable\" and \"copyable\" effects, which are related similarly, as you probably know. <br>\nDoes that help?</p>",
