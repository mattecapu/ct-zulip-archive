The actives correspond to the substitutions which use all of the variables in the context. I don't know when type theories admit active-inert factorization systems on their categories of contexts, but I think it's an interesting question.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For essentially algebraic theories, or their <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.4306em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">∞</span></span></span></span>-analogues, this basically happens when there is a presentation as a monad of the sort called \"strongly cartesian\", or sometimes \"polynomial\".  (Neither of these terms is really ideal--both of them could mean too many things.)</p>\n<p>Syntactically, this reflects \"rigidity\"--in the 1-pov this is simply the assertion that equations between terms don't make use of any structural operations (including weakening) to align their contexts.  This means that every term-in-context has a \"trace\" of which structural rules have been used on it, and this \"trace\" is invariant under permissible rewritings.</p>\n<p>What this corresponds to in the higher POV is less clear to me.  The \"rigidity\" is definitely less strict in that situation, as witnessed by the fact that <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>E</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">∞</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">E_\\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8333em;vertical-align:-0.15em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.05764em;\">E</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t vlist-t2\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.1514em;\"><span style=\"top:-2.55em;margin-left:-0.0576em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\">∞</span></span></span></span><span class=\"vlist-s\">​</span></span><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.15em;\"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> is a \"polynomial\" <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.4306em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">∞</span></span></span></span>-monad presented by an algebraic pattern.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This might be a fun question to work on a bit more, actually.</p>",

So what we want is, for each substitution, for it to canonically be a renaming of an \"active\" or \"generic\" substitution determined only by the operations of the substitution.  So, first off, if we blank out the context and all the references to variables in a substitution, we want to be able to reconstruct a substitution just from that, and the substitutions so reconstructed will be \"active\".
