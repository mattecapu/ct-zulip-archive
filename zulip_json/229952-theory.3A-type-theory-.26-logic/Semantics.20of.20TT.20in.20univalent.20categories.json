It is a famous problem to formalize semantics of HoTT in HoTT, but I thought it should be straightforward to formalize TT+K in HoTT since we can model it in sets, so the coherence problems shouldn't be an issues. But now after some thought I'm not actually sure it is possible. It seems we still run into the same problems. Did anyone try to do this?</p>",

Since everything is truncated, it seems we should be able to deal with coherence problems, but I'm not sure. So, I'd like to know if it was done already.</p>",
