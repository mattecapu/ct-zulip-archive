We're not super advanced compared to people in this Zulip, especially since it's mostly programmers rather than academics, but if anyone's curious, I can add you to the group (no obligation to actually come though). We're currently about to read Milewski's Category Theory for Programmers, and we've looked at Fong and Spivak's Invitation to Applied Category Theory (Seven Sketches).</p>",
