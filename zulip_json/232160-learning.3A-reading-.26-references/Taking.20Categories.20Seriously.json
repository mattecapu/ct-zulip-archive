        "content": "<p>Here's my attempt to explain a few of Lawvere's ideas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week200.html\">This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics (Week 200)</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Start here:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Lawvere started out as a student of Clifford Truesdell, working on \"continuum mechanics\", which is the very practical branch of field theory that deals with fluids, elastic bodies and the like. In the process, Lawvere got very interested in the foundations of physics, particularly the notions of \"continuum\" and \"physical theory\". Somehow he decided that only category theory could give him the tools to really make progress in understanding these notions. After all, this was the 1960s, and revolution was in the air. So, he somehow got himself sent to Columbia University to learn category theory from Sam Eilenberg, one of the two founders of the subject. He later wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In my own education I was fortunate to have two teachers who used the term \"foundations\" in a common-sense way (rather than in the speculative way of the Bolzano-Frege-Peano-Russell tradition). This way is exemplified by their work in <em>Foundations of Algebraic Topology</em>, published in 1952 by Eilenberg (with Steenrod), and <em>The Mechanical Foundations of Elasticity and Fluid Mechanics</em>, published in the same year by Truesdell. The orientation of these works seemed to be \"concentrate the essence of practice and in turn use the result to guide practice\". </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It may seem like a big jump from the down-to-earth world of continuum mechanics to category theory, but to Lawvere the connection made perfect sense - and while I've always found his writings inpenetrable, after hearing him give four long lectures in Florence I think it makes sense to me too! Let's see if I can explain it.</p>\n<p>Lawvere first observes that in the traditional approach to physical theories, there are two key players. First, there are \"concrete particulars\" - like specific ways for a violin string to oscillate, or specific ways for the planets to move around the sun. Second, there are \"abstract generals\": the physical laws that govern the motion of the violin string or the planets.</p>\n<p>In traditional logic, an abstract general is called a \"theory\", while a concrete particular is called a \"model\" of this theory. A theory is usually presented by giving some mathematical language, some rules of deduction, and then some axioms. A model is typically some sort of map that sends everything in the theory to something in the world of sets and truth values, in such a way that all the axioms get mapped to \"true\".</p>\n<p>Since theories involve playing around with symbols according to fixed rules, the study of theories is often called \"syntax\". Since the meaning of a theory is revealed when you look at its models, the study of models is called \"semantics\". The details vary a lot depending on what you want to do, and physicists rarely bother to formulate their theories axiomatically, but this general setup has been regarded as the ideal of rigor ever since the work of Bolzano, Frege, Peano and Russell around the turn of the 20th century.</p>\n<p>And this is what Lawvere wanted to overthrow!</p>\n<p>Actually, I'm sort of kidding. He didn't really want to \"overthrow\" this setup: he wanted to radically build on it. First, he wanted to free the notion of \"model\" from the chains of set theory. In other words, he wanted to consider models not just in the category of sets, but in other categories as well. And to do this, he wanted a new way of describing theories, which is less tied up in the nitty-gritty details of syntax.</p>\n<p>To see what Lawvere did, we need to look at an example. But there are so many examples that first I should give you a vague sense of the <em>range</em> of examples. </p>\n</blockquote>",
