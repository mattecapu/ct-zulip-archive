Other people may have more ability to get interested in self-contained mathematical subjects, so I don't want to project my taste on everyone else.  But I only became passionate about real analysis because I saw how it was used to understand light, heat, gravity and so on.  And this is indeed a major reason it was developed.  So for me, personally, I found a mixed curriculum of logic, math and physics to be very satisfying.  I think some pure mathematicians find ODE and PDE boring because they aren't using these equations to understand something.)</p>",

Are they also used in studying algebra? This paper: Cartesian double theories: A double-categorical framework for categorical doctrines by Michael Lambert, Evan Patterson</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I'm also interested in logic and model theory, which is why I'd like to study logic in connection with algebra eventually, and why I'd like an understanding of where the subjects lie in relation to each other, and the order they should be studied in.</p>\n<p>Putting down category theory and instead looking for an overview of math subjects I looked at the contents of Mathematical Concepts by Jürgen Jost which seems to have taken me in a circle as I saw that the last chapter is on topos theory.</p>",

In <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_algebra#Basic_idea\">universal algebra</a> you greatly limit the expressive power of your logic, in order to get more powerful results about the structures you can still describe.  (This is always the tradeoff.)  Basically, in universal algebra you only describe structures that have a bunch of operations obeying equational laws: this leaves out a lot of math, but covers groups and rings and lots of other \"algebraic\" things.</p>\n<p>The category theorist's approach to universal algebra involves Lawvere theories and algebraic theories.   There's also a more old-fashioned approach due to Birkhoff, which is also worth learning.</p>\n<p>Operads and props are similar enough to Lawvere theories that in the long run you'll see them as different parts of a spectrum.</p>",

There are also lots of such rig categories that <em>aren't</em> topoi.
