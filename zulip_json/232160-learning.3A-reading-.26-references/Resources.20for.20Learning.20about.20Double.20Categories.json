Especially for folks who have built an understanding in the basics of category theory (e.g. functors, universal properties, pullbacks/pushouts, equalizers, duality, etc.) and want to continue into higher category theory. One resource we thought of was:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Higher-Dimensional Categories</em> by Marco Grandis</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any other resources folks can think of here?

I don't think a fully precise answer is available yet but the answer must be something like \"typed regular logic with equality and function and relation symbols.\"</p>\n<p>In his earlier paper on <a href=\"http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/38/33/38-33abs.html\">double categories of relations</a>, Michael characterizes the 'double categories of relations' satisfying a number of extra conditions (have tabulators, are \"functionally complete\",  have a \"subobject comprehension scheme\") as precisely the double categories of relations on a regular category, namely the regular category of objects and arrows in the double category (Theorem 10.2). And the close connection between regular categories and regular logic is a classic part of categorical logic. But AFAIK these pieces have not been put together in a completely clear way.</p>",

        "content": "<p>It's even more interesting to ask what happens when these extra conditions are dropped. Category theoretically, it's just as easy to work in a generic cartesian equipment as in a 'double category of relations.'

The internal language of these is mysterious, though there has been work on a type theory for <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08663\">virtual equipments</a>.</p>",
