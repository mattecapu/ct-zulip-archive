Has anyone read it and come up with an opinion about it? The website (<a href=\"https://categoricalfuture.com/\">https://categoricalfuture.com/</a>) is frustratingly coy: the two plaudits mention \"magic\", the tiny excerpt is vague, and there is no table of contents. There's a longer excerpt at Amazon, but it is no less vague.</p>",
