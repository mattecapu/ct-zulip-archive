One good reference that you might already know is the \"EGNO\" book <a href=\"https://math.mit.edu/~etingof/egnobookfinal.pdf\">Tensor Categories</a>, which is not in the presentable setting but still shows what kinds of things one can do with categorified modules/etc. It's my impression that in the presentable case a lot of this stuff can be found in at least one of Lurie's books (probably higher algebra, as a special case of something to do with operads?) but I'm not actually 100% sure on that</p>",
