All these examples put a good spotlight on the glueing condition. Now that we've solidly established the definition of a sheaf, which feels rather substantive, I'll ask: what are a couple of cool things that we can do with sheaves, in at least a semi-applied sense?  I'm sure there are many; just fishing around here for some favorites.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My own favorite applications of sheaves are the ones that made people invent sheaves in the first place - applications to algebraic geometry and toplogy. I don't know how deeply we want to get into those here.  But it's not surprising that some of the most exciting applications of a concept are the ones that made people take the trouble to develop it in the first place! </p>\n<p>Briefly, since a bounded analytic function must be constant, there are no everywhere defined analytic functions on the Riemann sphere except constants - all the interesting ones have poles.   This issue affects all of complex analysis and algebraic geometry.   This puts pressure on us to either accept 'partially defined' functions as full-fledged mathematical objects or work with <em>sheaves</em> of functions, e.g. work with lots of different open sets <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>U</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">U</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.10903em;\">U</span></span></span></span> in the Riemann sphere and let <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>F</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>U</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">F(U)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.13889em;\">F</span><span class=\"mopen\">(</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.10903em;\">U</span><span class=\"mclose\">)</span></span></span></span> be the set of analytic functions everywhere defined on <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>U</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">U</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.10903em;\">U</span></span></span></span>.</p>\n<p>Mathematicians took the second course, because partially defined functions where you haven't specified the domain of definition are a pain to work with.   So nowadays all of algebraic geometry (subsuming chunks of complex analysis, and much much more) is founded on sheaves.   In this subject one can do a lot of amazing things with sheaves.   Later on these tricks expanded to algebraic topology.  And this is how a typical math grad student (like me) is likely to encounter sheaves.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, I'm happy to get into more detail about what we actually do with sheaves.  But it's quite extensive: the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem and pretty much all the other big results in algebraic geometry relies heavily on sheaves.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Great application, thanks!</p>",

[paywall]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Abstract.  This paper uses concepts from sheaf theory to explain phenomena in concurrent systems, including object, inheritance, deadlock, and non-interference, as used in computer security. The approach is very general, and applies not only to concurrent object oriented systems, but also to systems of differential equations, electrical circuits, hardware description languages, and much more. Time can be discrete or continuous, linear or branching, and distribution is allowed over space as well as time. Concepts from category theory help to achieve this generality: objects are modelled by sheaves; inheritance by sheaf morphisms; systems by diagrams; and interconnection by diagrams of diagrams. In addition, behaviour is given by limit, and the result of interconnection by colimit. The approach is illustrated with many examples, including a semantics for a simple concurrent object-based programming language.</p>",

As for o-minimal geometry, let me briefly explain what I meant. It's usual to consider sheaves of definable functions on the lattice of definable sets of a given dimension (e.g. as done from p155 onward in <em>Tame topology and o-minimal structures</em>). The definable sets always form a Boolean algebra; if the underlying o-minimal structure has type I according to the trichotomy theorem of Peterzil and Starchenko, then the category of sheaves of parameter-free definables <em>is</em> equivalent to a presheaf category; the same sort of presheaves on a finite poset as in cellular sheaves above. I don't know whether that's good or bad, but if we would regard criticizing the o-minimal geometers for their terminological choice weird, then perhaps we shouldn't criticize the applied topologists for it either.</p>\n<p>With that said, let's not dwell too much more on these examples. Maybe the SAG one was just wrong, maybe somebody else will bring better examples of the phenomenon I'm after, but in any case, my point wasn't meant to be \"let's scrutinize the geometers too\", I aimed to address some broader phenomenon.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Speaking for myself, what would satisfy me as an application of \"sheaves\" would be a nontrivial site appearing \"naturally\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I understand that, and I think both you Matteo and John have a fair stance here. I too don't think cellular sheaves (or for that matter, the sheaves in o-minimal geometry mentioned above) are good examples for explaining the uses of sheaves to somebody. They're not merely <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exemplar_theory#Typicality_and_exemplars\">atypical exemplars</a>, but they lack precisely those properties that make sheaves very useful in the central/typical areas of algebraic geometry and topology that one might want to illustrate! Essentially, I'm fully on board with John's summary above: \"<em>I'm not convinced it really illustrates the power of sheaves</em>\".</p>\n<p>But this is akin to considering cassowaries an odd choice for representing birds to someone unfamiliar with the diversity of bird species. Absolutely true, and yet no reason to think that the taxonomists who classified cassowaries as birds were \"<em>trying to cash in on the glamour of saying they're studying birds</em>\".</p>\n<p>It's only the latter, \"trying to cash in on the glamour\" characterization specifically that I find troubling, in the sense that I don't think we could apply such a criterion fairly across various disciplines.</p>\n<p>For instance, if a sheaf F constructed over the course of an algebraic geometry proof turns out to a sheaf of modules based on a finite site (I'm quite sure this has happened before), all would readily accept F as natural due to its role in the proof, and nobody ( except perhaps Reviewer 2 ;) ) would worry that the author is merely trying to cash in on the glamour of sheaves. Whereas if the proof happens to be in a discrete mathematics or applied topology textbook, the standards are suddenly much more stringent, “you don't get to use the cool name” unless your example is very \"natural\", sometimes with conditions that finite structures cannot possibly meet. Which is exactly my reading of <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"276363\">@Amar Hadzihasanovic</span> 's point about <em>penalizing discrete mathematics</em>, the one that I find very plausible. It's not about whether we have a precise standard of what counts as natural [1] but about whether we apply such a standard consistently to practitioners of all fields, or only ever subject practitioners of certain subfields to it [2]. </p>\n<p>I hope that makes sense.</p>\n<p>[1] And it's quite possible that there's a reasonable standard, stricter than just technically being a sheaf, and my suggested examples don't actually qualify under this standard! I'm fine with \"it counts as an honest example as long as it's not equivalent to a category of presheaves\".</p>\n<p>[2] But I do doubt that algebraic geometers or topologists had their choice of terminology subjected to any such standard. E.g. if we argue that the standard should exclude sheaves on Alexandroff spaces from the class of honest examples, then before we adopt the standard I'd like to see some evidence that we previously reprimanded e.g. the noncommutative geometers for studying certain sheaves on Alexandroff spaces qua sheaves, and not qua presheaves.</p>\n<p>[3] But I don't think \"having a nontrivial Grothendieck topology\" is the sensible standard we're looking for, nor a good approximation to a \"naturally arising\" site. It leads to a situation where if we study sheaves on certain open set lattices (even one which some geometers and topologists care about), we have a dishonest example. But as soon as we artificially restrict the allowed covers to only the finite ones, while retaining the very same open set lattice, thereby making the structure both more artificial and nastier in every mathematical sense (including in senses that geometers and topologists care about) we somehow get a more honest example. Presumably, if one is not excited about certain sheaves because they are merely presheaves in disguise, one would get less, not more excited about these ones?</p>",
