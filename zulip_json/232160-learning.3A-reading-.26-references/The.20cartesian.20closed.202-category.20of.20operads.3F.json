I am puzzled by this claim.</p>\n<p>Monoids are categories with one objects, and the category of categories is indeed cartesian closed, but the full subcategory of monoids is not stable by the internal hom given that it can increase the number of objects. As operads are one object multicategories, in analogy with the case of monoids I would be ready to believe that multicategories assemble into a cartesian closed (2-)category whose full subcategory of one-object multicategories, i.e. operads, is not stable by the internal hom.</p>\n<p>Is the \"operad\" in that webpage a synonym for multicategory? Or is the 2-category of one-object multicategories really cartesian closed, in which case the analogy between the situation of operads w.r.t multicategories and the situation of monoids w.r.t categories is not completely accurate? Or is this a typo? Or something else?</p>",
