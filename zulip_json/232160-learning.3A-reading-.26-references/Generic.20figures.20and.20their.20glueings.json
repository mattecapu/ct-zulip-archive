Since I have been enjoying this community very much, I thought I could share our progress here and maybe recruit other members that want to learn about topos theory. Our first meeting is Firday 2:30pm EST and we will only discuss the intro of the book, our background in CT and possibly meeting arrangements. I'll try to keep this topic updated so that if you cannot join now, you can catch up later.</p>\n<p>We chose this book because it seemed to be a very beginner friendly introduction to toposes, but if the reading group goes well, we will probably continue our journey into topos theory with other resources so any recommendation will be appreciated. I already have in mind <a href=\"https://rdcu.be/cbGG4\">this paper</a> that was advertised here as a nice application and Olivia Caramello's <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/theories-sites-toposes-9780198758914\">book</a> because I think I'd like to know more about toposes being used for unification.</p>\n<p>Cheers!</p>",
