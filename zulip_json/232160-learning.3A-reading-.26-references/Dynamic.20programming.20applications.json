I'll admit the first two are a little outside my \"casual perusal\" range.</p>\n<p>The third by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"275901\">@Jules Hedges</span> I understand more. However, it looks like though the title is dynamic programming, the real thrust is generalized toward reinforcement learning. In modern practice of course this is fully justified, but I'm working with an old variant of deterministic dynamic programming.</p>\n<p>But If I understand it correctly, \"ordinary\" dynamic programming can be expressed as a lens, while introducing stochasticity requires leveling up to the more general optic. Lenses are a lot more intuitive to me, so I would like that to be correct.</p>",
