As part of that I am trying to gather a list of ACT papers with various applications throughout science (physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, anything).</p>\n<p>The main challenge I face is that I need (at least some) papers that require very little category theory background, given that some students don't have a signficant experience. </p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"302507\">@David Corfield</span> suggested asking on Zulip, whether anybody has a suggestion how to find papers, which involve different levels of category theory (ranging from mostly using the basic definitions up to advanced categorical concepts).</p>\n<p>Any suggestion would be much appreciated!</p>",

From the plan it seems to me you had some pretty decent students. How did this go, did you get students to enjoy category theory?</p>",

But very happy to hear your event was this succesful, makes me more optimistic. It is funny, I myself was already thinking (and very much unsure) about picking between a \"scattered seminar\" vs. \"guided seminar\", so it's interesting you struggled with the same issue.</p>",
