I've started venturing into co/algebraic modal logic and I'm noticing that basically everything is done in a Kleisli category, as in: everything described in Venema's \"Algebras and Coalgebras\" so far can be described as some endofunctor in a category of free algebras over some set-valued monad (Also took part in ItaCa this winter and the term \"Kleisli Category\"  was thrown around multiple times so I guess it must be quite important for categorial logic in general). Are there any resources you can recommend to learn more about monads comonads and their free co/algebras? I'm sure that they must have nice properties and I'd like to have some resources to gain expertise</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance</p>",
