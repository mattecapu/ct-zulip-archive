My immediate goal is to understand something about 2/bi-/double categories and 2-operads for systems theory, but more broadly I am looking to learn some infinity category theory and related homotopy theory.<br>\nAs a side note, have people been applying homotopical/infinity-categorical ideas to the sciences at all (more in the spirit of categorical probability, quantum theory, or systems theory as opposed to quantum field theory-related things)?</p>",
