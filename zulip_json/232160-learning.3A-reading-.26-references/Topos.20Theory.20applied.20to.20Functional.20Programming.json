        "content": "<p>Hello everyone. I was wondering if there are any resources on the use of Topos Theory applied to Functional Programming. I've been reading a bit on Topos Theory, and the texts tend to emphasize how toposes are used to relate global and local structures. I imagined that perhaps it could serve as a \"canonical\" way of representing data structures where one has nested contexts. For example, suppose we have geographical map inside another geographical map, and we want to define an interface that allows us to hop from one context to another. Perhaps Topos (or some other concept in Category Theory) can provide a clear framework for how to properly deal with such situations. I haven't been able to find references that try to apply Topos Theory to Functional Programming in the vein of Bartosz \"Category Theory for Programmers\".</p>",

But first watch DJM's very accessible talk I linked above and if you are still psyched, before embarking on a year+ math quest, perhaps try and work through <a href=\"https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2020/01/05/topos-theory-part-1/\">John Baez' series on topoi</a> which heavily features sheaves and should be accessible if you worked through Bartosz' lectures on category theory and are willing to look up some math/topology syntax.  Your ally in learning this could be <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"277503\">@David Egolf</span> as he has started an entire active thread for reading through the series.
