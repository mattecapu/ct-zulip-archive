These go with with the middle volume, by Leila Schneps 'Mathematics' (<a href=\"https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~leila.schneps/grothendieckcircle/Mathematics.html\">four chapters available here</a>). The first volume is mostly about Grothendieck's parents and his childhood, the last volume is about his post-IHÉS life, up to the 1991 disappearance. (These are all at the page Julius linked)</p>\n<p>I just discovered that Scharlau died in late 2020, so I don't know what happened to what I thought was a planned fourth volume...</p>",
