Various strange things happen in this situation, for example the identity functor doesn't have a (weak) generic object and the codomain \"fibration\" isn't a fibration at all.  Are there any good resources on working with fibrations in this kind of limited environment?</p>",

One can represent them as Morita equivalent Lie groupoids.</p>",
