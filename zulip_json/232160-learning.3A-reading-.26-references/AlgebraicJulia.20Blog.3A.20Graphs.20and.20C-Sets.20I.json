Evan Patterson wrote a really nice blog post, <a href=\"https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2020/09/cset-graphs-1/\">\"What Is a Graph?\"</a>, in a series of posts on that blog discussing Catlab's approach to understanding graphs. </p>\n<p>I understood the majority of the blog when it was discussing graphs but got lost a bit in the nuance when we started discussing graphs as C-Sets. I had a few questions in the blog post that I have extracted below (the sections I am most curious about are the ones: <a href=\"https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2020/09/cset-graphs-1/#graphs-as-c-sets\">Graphs as C-Sets</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.algebraicjulia.org/post/2020/09/cset-graphs-1/#symmetric-graphs\">Symmetric Graphs</a>)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Here are the questions I had:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In this context, the category C is interpreted as a schema<br>\n~ Graphs as C-Sets</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What is a schema in this context here? Where can I read more about it? I wasn't sure if this was relating to a programming schema or a mathematical idea of a schema.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>parts in the structure and the subpart relations between them<br>\n~ Graphs as C-Sets</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What are parts and subparts? This is what was making me think that a schema is a sort of mathematical object.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>there are two kinds of parts, of type V and E<br>\n~ Graphs as C-Sets</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What are types in this context?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>schema for graphs is the category Sch(Graph) [...] In particular, when  C=Sch(Graph), a C-set is exactly a graph as previously defined.<br>\n~ Graphs as C-Sets</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How are these two things isomorphic to one another? Does this encode some sort of functor or natural transformation? Struggling a bit to parse this out fully.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Unpacking this, a symmetric graph is a graph G together with an orientation-reversing involution on edges<br>\nSymmetric Graphs</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What is an involution in this situation? I realized I may not be very familiar with this idea and even after trying to read about it, I am struggling to understand it from a category theoretic perspective -- an involution switches out arrows? Or switches the direction of errors?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Thanks folks and looking forward to discussing further if folks can help me parsing out these ideas! Additionally, I am happy to provide more clarification or thoughts as needed. Thank you!!!</p>",

This is pretty close to the categorical version, except that foreign keys (columns representing functional relations between tables) are sometimes implicit, whereas in the categorical story they are strongly distinguished from \"attributes\" that represent actual data (i.e. strings, numbers, etc.)</p>\n<p>Formally, the difference is that the unique identifier (key) marking a row in a table has no semantic meaning. You would get an equivalent DB if you changed the keys to a different format, as long as you changed the let values stored in other tables at the same time. This is very different from names, birth dates, etc., which can't be modified without changing the meaning of the data.</p>",

(Not my favorite terminology). In categorical terms, an instance is a set-valued functor, the parts are the elements of the sets in the image, and the subparts are the values of the functions in the image. </p>\n<p>For example, an edge or a vertex is a part, and the source vertex of an edge is a subpart.</p>",

Then you could define functors back and forth, and natural transformations establishing an equivalence of categories. </p>\n<p>However, it's probably more convincing to just draw a directed graph on paper and then figure out how to represent it as a C-set.

(Attributes are not treated specially in this simple picture, but the simplicity is what makes it the best place to start to get the general idea.

An involution is a function that is it's own inverse (so necessarily an endomorphism). </p>\n<p>In this case, categorical schemas don't have a good way of <em>not</em> distinguishing the source and target of an edge (the usual way would be a two element subset, but subsets require power objects, and that is a big step up in logical strength), so instead we just put in two edges pointing either way, and regard the undirected edges as orbits of the involution.</p>",
