I'm wondering if there have been work on generalizing this idea to H-valued groupoids in some appropriate sense of the word. More generally, the construction of H-valued sets is generalized by the tripos-to-topos construction, and so I'm also wondering if there's any work on some sort of tripos-to-(2,1)-topos construction.</p>\n<p>Perhaps related to this question: The (2, 1)-category of groupoids should be a (2, 1)-topos. So, it is reasonable to expect a correct notion of H-valued groupoid to also yield a (2, 1)-topos. But is there a more accessible account of (2,1)-toposes that does not require wading through infinity-toposes as in Lurie's Higher Topos Theory?</p>",

But I don't think that describes all 2-sheaves over H...</p>\n<p>A definition making the equivalence work would be nontrivial, I think. It seems worthwhile trying to work it backwards from sheaves to H-sets and, then, try copying the procedure starting with sheaves valued in groupoids in order to get the correct definition... but I don't even remember how was the equivalence and I'm too lazy to search for it.</p>",

You seem to want a 2-topos out at the end, which for me would suggest that when generalising the tripos-to-topos construction, you should be replacing partial equivalence relations with some kernel pair groupoids.  I'm not aware of any work in this direction.</p>",

My current thinking is that (2,1)-triposes should be pseudofunctors valued in a category of cartesian closed categories, ie. \"proof-relevant\" Heyting algebras. As things become proof-relevant, partial equivalence relations should be generalised to a partial version of cateads (see Bourke's thesis for a nice account of these).</p>",
