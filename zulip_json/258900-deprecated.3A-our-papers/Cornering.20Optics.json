I think fewer axioms are better, and so since it doesn't really get us anything I prefer not to make the identifications.</p>\n<p>Moreover I think the category of horizontal cells is pretty interesting, so I'm hesitant to collapse any of the structure there before I feel like I really understand it (which I do not).
