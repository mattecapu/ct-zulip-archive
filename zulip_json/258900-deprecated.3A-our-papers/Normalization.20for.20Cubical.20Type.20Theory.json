You can see our preprint here: <a href=\"http://www.jonmsterling.com/pdfs/cubical-norm.pdf\">http://www.jonmsterling.com/pdfs/cubical-norm.pdf</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We prove normalization for (univalent, Cartesian) cubical type theory, closing the last major open problem in the syntactic metatheory of cubical type theory. Our normalization result is reduction-free, in the sense of yielding an injective function from equivalence classes of terms in context to a tractable language of β/η-normal forms. As corollaries we obtain both decidability of judgmental equality as well as the injectivity of type constructors in judgmentally consistent contexts.</p>\n</blockquote>",
