It was a lot of fun to write. We were able to understand a whole bunch of topos properties much better (for ourselves, at least!) through the lens of monoids, and conversely to \"understand monoids via geometry\" in a whole new way. If I can get my act together with my own papers, it should be the start of a much bigger story..!</p>",
