For instance, the first nontrivial example  of our algebra is actually the finite-dimensional algebra which governs the  principle block of BGG category O for sl_2: this is a 5-dimensional algebra, given as the path algebra of a quiver with 2 nodes, say alpha and beta, and an arrow each way between them, subject to the condition that any path passing through beta twice must die</p>",
