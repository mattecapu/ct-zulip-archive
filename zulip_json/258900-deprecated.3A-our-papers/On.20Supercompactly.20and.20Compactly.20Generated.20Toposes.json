        "content": "<p>Hi all! I uploaded my <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04015\">rather long preprint</a> last week. It's on a couple of big classes of Grothendieck toposes, those with enough supercompact objects or compact objects, respectively, where here I mean \"compact object\" in the weaker sense that every covering family on such an object has a finite subcover.<br>\nThe supercompactly generated toposes include all presheaf toposes, regular toposes, atomic toposes, and interestingly for me, all toposes of topological monoid actions (although that last part is only hinted at in the paper). The compactly generated toposes include all of these, plus all coherent toposes.<br>\nThe highlights are that I find an intrinsic characterisation of morphisms whose inverse images preserve supercompact/compact objects, I give canonical sites for these toposes (which interestingly are characterised purely in terms of their colimits rather than their limits), as well as more general sites, and I use the whole lot to recover some familiar 2-categorical dualities for posets and semilattices.</p>",

In light of the results of the paper, this is a valid name, but it begs the question of what the intermediate 'polite' morphisms should be called to match this convention. Can anyone come up with something more compelling than \"quasisuperproper\"?</p>",
