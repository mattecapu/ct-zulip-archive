But since the 90s it turned out that categories were good to talk about ways in which a Petri net can run. There are 3 ways we can make this better:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Categories are good to compose things. We can generalize in this direction and obtain a way to compose Petri nets. This is what John has been doing with open Petri nets. There are also other notions of composing nets that exploit categorical ideas.</li>\n<li>We can better realize the correspondence between categories and nets. The mantra of the 90s approach was that categories of nets and categories of categories are adjoint in some way. This can be made more precise by refining your definition of net or the one of the category you use to model the executions. This is what John, me, Jade and Mike have been doing in our last paper, for instance.</li>\n<li>The last way of employing cats is that there are countless flavors of Petri nets around (nets, guarded nets, timed nets, hierarchical nets, nets with inhibitor arcs, ...). Many of them have never been modelled categorically. This is what me, Fosco and Daniele are tackling with our papers now. An example in this direction, but using different means was my paper with Jelle Herold about integer nets, that has been much further extended and systhematized by Jade with her \"generalized Petri nets\" approach. <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span></li>\n</ul>",

Until fairly recently one big open question was this: we knew roughly that a Petri net was a way of describing some sort of symmetric monoidal category, so there should be some left adjoint functor from some category of Petri nets to some category of symmetric monoidal categories... but how <em>exactly</em> does this work?  A lot of work was done on this, starting in 1990, but all this work had peculiarly complicated features.

I think this is just one way to represent the semantics of Petri nets. For us, categorists, this is clearly the right way.

I did a bit of this with <span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"276037\">Jade Master</span>  in <a href=\"https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2018/08/15/open-petri-nets-part-1/\">Open Petri nets</a> and a bit more with you, Jade and <span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"276777\">Mike Shulman</span> in <a href=\"https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2021/01/17/categories-of-nets/\">Categories of nets</a>.   </p>\n<p>But I wanted to do more... and I helped Jade and <span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"275914\">Joe Moeller</span> get going on a way of describing a colored Petri net by applying the Grothendieck construction to a functor out of the symmetric monoidal category generated by an ordinary Petri net.  They spent a lot of time working on a paper about this... but they gave up, in the way young authors do, when they saw your similar work.   (Older authors know that there's room in the universe for two similar papers.)</p>\n<p>On the other hand, I'm basically happy!   I'm glad you're getting all this stuff straightened out!<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No offense but I think Joe and I would have felt more optimistic about putting out our almost duplicate paper if you were a coauthor. It can be much harder to get a journal to accept a paper when the authors are young and without a lot of reputation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hmm, it hadn't occurred to me to ask John to join. I think at the time I was eager to try to write stuff without my advisor's help. Now I'm a bit more open to it. Maybe when John's list gets a little shorter we could consider salvaging something from it. There's some stuff in there that isn't in Fabrizio and David's paper.</p>",
