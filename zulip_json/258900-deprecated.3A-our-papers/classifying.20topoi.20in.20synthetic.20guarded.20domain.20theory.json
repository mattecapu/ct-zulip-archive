In order to unify the accounts of guarded recursion and coinduction, several authors have enriched SGDT with multiple \"clocks\" parameterizing different time-streams, leading to more complex and difficult to understand topos models. Until now these topoi have been understood very concretely qua categories of presheaves, and the logico-geometrical question of what theories these topoi classify has remained open. We show that several important topos models of SGDT classify very simple geometric theories, and that the passage to various forms of multi-clock guarded recursion can be rephrased more compositionally in terms of the lower bagtopos construction of Vickers and variations thereon due to Johnstone. We contribute to the consolidation of SGDT by isolating the universal property of multi-clock guarded recursion as a modular construction that applies to any topos model of single-clock guarded recursion.</p>\n<p><strong>PDF:</strong>  <a href=\"https://www.jonmsterling.com/papers/palombi-sterling:2022.pdf\">https://www.jonmsterling.com/papers/palombi-sterling:2022.pdf</a></p>",
