In mathe- matics, they are used to build symmetric algebras, in computer science, to build free exponential modal- ities of linear logic and in physics, Fock spaces. We study symmetric powers through the lens of category theory. We focus here on the simpler case where nonnegative rational scalars are available ie. we study symmetric powers in symmetric monoidal Q≥0-linear categories. Among the developments, a main point is the introduction of the notion of binomial graded bimonoid and the associated string diagrams which characterize symmetric powers in this setting.</p>\n<p>I would gladly receive any comment about it! I'm happy because this is the first paper I write alone (and my second one in total) but I'm also a bit more uncertain about it because of this same fact <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span></p>",
