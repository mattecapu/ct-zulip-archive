A freshly revised version (v3) is now on arXiv.</p>\n<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>This paper introduces Concurrent Valuation Algebras (CVAs), a novel extension of ordered valuation algebras (OVAs). CVAs include two combine operators representing parallel and sequential products, adhering to a weak exchange law. This development offers theoretical and practical benefits for the specification and modelling of concurrent and distributed systems. As a presheaf on a space of domains, CVAs enable localised specifications, supporting modularity, compositionality, and the ability to represent large and complex systems. Furthermore, CVAs align with lattice-based refinement reasoning and are compatible with established methodologies such as Hoare and Rely-Guarantee logics. The flexibility of CVAs is explored through three trace models, illustrating distinct paradigms of concurrent/distributed computing, interrelated by morphisms. The paper also highlights the potential to incorporate a powerful local computation framework from valuation algebras for model checking in concurrent and distributed systems. The foundational results presented have been verified with the proof assistant Isabelle/HOL.</em></p>\n<p>A significant part of the paper (Sections 2,3,4,6) is formalised in the proof assistant Isabelle/HOL. You can find the code <a href=\"https://github.com/nasosev/cva\">here</a>. A word of warning though, this was my first project with Isabelle, so my approach may be a bit unorthodox! <span aria-label=\"upside down\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f643\" role=\"img\" title=\"upside down\">:upside_down:</span></p>\n<p>I can't let this moment pass without expressing my heartfelt gratitude to this incredible community. Your friendship, support, and invaluable insights have directly contributed to this paper. Thank you! <span aria-label=\"pray\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f64f\" role=\"img\" title=\"pray\">:pray:</span></p>\n<p>(On a more personal note, and I hope it's okay to mention this here, I'm approaching the end of my PhD journey and am actively looking for work.
