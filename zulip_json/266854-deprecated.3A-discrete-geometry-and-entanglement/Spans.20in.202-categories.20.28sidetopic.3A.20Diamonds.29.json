So I felt that since differential geometry was beautiful and differential geometry did such a good job of describing continuum physics, that if physics was actually discrete (and the continuum emerged as some kind of limit), there should be an equally beautiful language to describe it.</p>\n<p>In the preprint with Urs, we found there is a special structure we call \"diamond\" where the algebraic structures on finite / countable sets seem to mimectically line up nicely with continuum spacetime geometry (and there are some eerily cool applications in finance and climate science). A diamond is like a minimal causal set connecting two causally connect points in spacetime.</p>\n<p>The results we wrote up were restricted to globally cubic directed lattices, which I'm afraid could make people think the results are limited to cubic lattices, but diamonds can discretize (a conjecture that still needs proving) any smooth manifold of the form <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"script\">M</mi><mo>×</mo><mi mathvariant=\"double-struck\">R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathcal{M}\\times\\mathbb{R}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.76666em;vertical-align:-0.08333em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathcal\">M</span></span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;\"></span><span class=\"mbin\">×</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.68889em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathbb\">R</span></span></span></span></span>.
