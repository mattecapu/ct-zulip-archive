That's useful as it's his call as to whether something is compatible with official Instiki - which matters as it would not desirable for us to maintain a custom version.   As to whether a feature actually gets built, that will depend upon the availability of <em>someone</em> in the community to do the work.    But the design question comes first.</p>",
