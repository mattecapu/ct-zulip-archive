Incoming vertical wires are resources you take from the environment, outgoing vertical wires are resources you release to the environment. If the monoidal category you draw this diagrams for is not cartesian or affine, then you're forced by the linearity of its type system to always keep a balance of incoming and outgoing resources.</p>",
