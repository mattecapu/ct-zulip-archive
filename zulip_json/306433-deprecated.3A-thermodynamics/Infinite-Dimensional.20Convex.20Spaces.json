The reason people typically don't think about this in statistical mechanics is because they always work with convex spaces of probability measures. However, there are reasons in QM not to always work with <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi mathvariant=\"script\">L</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>X</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathcal{L}^2(X)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1.0641em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathcal\">L</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.8141em;\"><span style=\"top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"mopen\">(</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.07847em;\">X</span><span class=\"mclose\">)</span></span></span></span>, and so we have a general definition of Hilbert spaces. Likewise, I believe there are reasons to work with convex spaces that are not simply convex spaces of probability measures, as discussed in <a href=\"#narrow/stream/306433-practice.3A-thermodynamics/topic/Statistical.20Mechanical.20Fock.20Space\">the other thread</a>.</p>",
