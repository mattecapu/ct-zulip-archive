All fields of mathematics are so specialized that it seems very rare to me that a paper would actually be of interest to a completely arbitrary mathematician.  However, when I peruse the contents of recent issues of such journals (even very prestigious ones), I find approximately zero papers that are of interest to <em>me</em>, or that I even understand well enough to evaluate.  When I occasionally do run across a paper that I understand, I can rarely isolate any difference between it and papers published in more \"specialized\" journals.

        "content": "<p>I think that David very synthetically described the whole phenomenon.</p>\n<p>While I agree that \"general interest\" is indeed not well defined, it is almost evident what they actually mean. Unfortunately, in order to make sense of my previous statement, I will have to dive in a quite boring discussion. Be patient.</p>\n<p>I encourage everyone to open scimago and give a look at the most impacted maths journal (<a href=\"https://www.scimagojr.com/journalrank.php?area=2600\">https://www.scimagojr.com/journalrank.php?area=2600</a>). Of coruse, one should polish a little bit the noise generated by applied mathematics, but once this is done, you remain with a selection of \"Tier A\" journals. Let me list a couple of names that you probably already know.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Journal of the American Mathematical Society</li>\n<li>Annals of Mathematics</li>\n<li>Inventiones Mathematicae</li>\n<li>Acta Mathematica</li>\n<li>Duke Mathematical Journal</li>\n<li>Annales Scientifiques de l'Ecole Normale Superieure</li>\n<li>Compositio Mathematica</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These journals are by fare the most cited in pure mathematics, and somehow define trends and \"Fields-medal\" areas. One should not be so naive to think that these are journals. The scientific publishing policy of a journal is set by the scientific bias of its Editorial board. So, the next step of our analysis is to list all the editors of these journals. I will not include the list as it would be too long, but everybody that wants to have a good understanding of our community should spend some time doing this exercise.</p>\n<p>Ok, once you have this list, you are ready to define what they \"evidently\" mean by \"general interest\". That is, a paper that contains the same keywords of the papers written by the list of editors we just created.</p>\n<p>Now, of course this is an incredibly silly definition of \"general interest\", but it is very much practical and somehow also unavoidable. It is hard to me to stress enough on the word \"unavoidable\", very often in science our idealism does not allow us to understand that some phenomena are not choice-driven, they are just Nash equilibria of the system. In particular, players did not collectively decide to fall in this \"hole\". Each player was/is player his/her strategy. (This is an important remark to the general and clich√© critique to capitalism as an economical system).</p>\n<p>Now, let me dedicate a couple of words about the importance of \"political statements\". In the previous discussion it is evident that to claim that something is of \"general interest\" is essentially either \"praise the winners\" or a political statement. </p>\n<p>Should we claim that a CT-paper deserves to be on Advances? As a fact, this is the practical problem that we encounter. Now, if one spends time studying the publications about CT on Advances, one finds very technical papers having no impact on \"general mathematics\", nor \"trendy mathematics. It is thus evident that some of us have decided to state (consciously or unconsciously) that CT should enter in the Heaven/Mafia/Protected circle of those fields that rule the subject.</p>\n<p>My very personal opinion is that we should push our best technical achievements that truly contains original and ambitious results for these journals, or papers that gather/link/connect different areas of mathematics in a truly new and original way. Notice that, as trivial as it may seems, the previous statement is saying that some technical papers whose motivations would be un-understandable to the \"TIER-A editors\" should not be accepted by Advances. This scales back the political statement that CT deserves to be trendy \"on the spot\" and instead invests on the long-term-strategy that high-quality product will eventually make the rest of CT easier to digest by the mathematical community.</p>\n<p>So, long story short, I personally support modest political statements against the above-stated definition of \"general interest\".</p>\n<p>The reason for which I do not like the strong political statement of accepting a too technical paper for a very prestigious journal is that we are trying to save ourselves, reproducing a very mafia-like approach, which we should softly fight. We should not try to join the french nobelty of the 18th century, we should softly, and slowly start an intellectual revolution that re-thinks trends in mathematics. Moreover, pushing for a \"bad paper\" on a \"good journal\" will just make our reputation worse on the long run. A fraud is a fraud.</p>",
