Horizon grants from the EU are even worse than that, the bureaucratic definition of hell. If you are looking for grants in the enterprise sector instead it can be very different. Many grants in my line of work are 1-pagers for instance. My personal record for writing a winning grant submitted to the Ethereum Foundation has been ~70 minutes from the time I first saw the questions on the form. This probably won't give you points for tenure but hey, it contributes to paying bills!</p>",
