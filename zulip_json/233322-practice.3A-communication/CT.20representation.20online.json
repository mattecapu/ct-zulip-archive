We were turned off to category theory by the excesses of the sixties, when a small but loud crowd pretended to reduce all of mathematics to the language of categories. Now at least they have toned down their claims, and category theory has taken its modest place in the mathematical spectrum side by side with lattice theory, more pretentious perhaps than the latter, but with a good pedigree. [...]</p>\n<p>What stems from the quote is that the CT community always had a kind of evangelic attitude, and like many minorities, it had to work in order to assess/conquer its relevance and importance. For the lack of counterfactuals,  it is hard to claim that this behavior has brought success to the community. Maybe the community has gained some success, <em>despite</em> this behavior?! It's hard to say. It is a fact though that between 1945 and the late 2000s the community has grown in size and prestige. Some pieces of evidence of this are JPAA, which has found its place among the most relevant specialist journals in algebra, Street joining the EB of Advances, and some prestigious publications, say by Moerdijk, in journals of the level of Compositio. These three examples, which are far from being cherry-picked, all happened before what I would call \"the blog post era\", and ages before the \"Twitter era\".</p>\n<p>Since 2010, if anything, the community has lost in prestige and academic relevance, despite (I totally admit it) having reached a much broader audience in popularization and pop culture. The number of prestigious journals we have access to has drastically declined and is now totally restricted to Advances, JPAA is losing quite some prestige and is less and less controlled by CT-sts, it would be unimaginable nowadays to see a CT paper appear on Compositio. Yes, the community has had the HoTT sprint for a while, but that has lost quite some of its initial momentum too and -- I think --, overall, if we compare generation by generation, yours (Mike) is less prestigious than its parents, and mine is even less prestigious than yours.</p>\n<p>Now, on a more \"pop-culture\" side of the story, I agree we have gained a lot in visibility, and this is mostly due to the twitting/blogging thing I touched on previously. Has this truly benefitted our community?! That's unclear. And let me stress, this is the behavior I was calling toxic, not the one of the elder generation. In order to discuss it, let me describe it better.</p>\n<p>John, who is the person I was responding to, wrote \"category theorists, much more than say analysts, are able to state exciting snappy results that fit in a tweet\". This is indeed what happens all the time, a somewhat young and often not very expert PhD student that was nourished in mottos and nlab stories writes on Twitter that whatever all mathematicians are doing is, in fact, all trivial and reduces to the bright and somewhat magical fact that a monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors. The result? A number of narcissist crackpots enter this very zulip for a couple of weeks and then leave it, a number of young PhD students in other areas think that the PhD student is just an annoying prick (deservedly), and the PhD student grows with a strange complex of superiority which is incredibly hard to heal later in their studies. How is this <em>not</em> supposed to be toxic, I wonder. Now, I have mentioned PhD students here, but I honestly believe that a number of more senior searchers are not only themselves part of what I described, but also responsible for the behavior of their PhD students, who just repeated their attitude. </p>\n<p>All in all, am I saying that we should not try to make category theory broader in scope and more impactful on the math community? Of course not! We should! And I think my actions show that I am very much invested in that. Twitting \"ah-ah, you are all my pawns, because universal algebra is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors and I rule them all. Am I not the smartest?\", instead, may not be the best way to actively do healthy popularization, let alone dissemination of category theory.</p>",

When you think of the Beck-Chevalley condition derived from a pullback, it looks like it's going to be connected to Frobenius equations (as in Frobenius algebras).</p>",

If this is true, then I'm inclined to view it as a welcome correction from the days of the late 20th century when category theory tended to be deprecated (especially in the U.S.) as useless abstraction or \"just a language\".  Maybe an overcorrection, but (as a category theorist) it doesn't seem intrinsically bad.  In my own opinion, there's a lot more room for categorical concepts to usefully infuse, say, an undergraduate math curriculum than has yet happened across the board.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is going to be a very long reply, because your comment is wrong on a multitude of levels in my opinion, and I will try to address at least some of them.</p>\n<p>The following is a quote from Rota 1993 on the proceedings of the Category Theory conference held in 1991:</p>\n<p>It is good to know that category theory is alive and well after all these years. We were turned off to category theory by the excesses of the sixties, when a small but loud crowd pretended to reduce all of mathematics to the language of categories. Now at least they have toned down their claims, and category theory has taken its modest place in the mathematical spectrum side by side with lattice theory, more pretentious perhaps than the latter, but with a good pedigree. [...]</p>\n<p>What stems from the quote is that the CT community always had a kind of evangelic attitude, and like many minorities, it had to work in order to assess/conquer its relevance and importance. For the lack of counterfactuals,  it is hard to claim that this behavior has brought success to the community. Maybe the community has gained some success, <em>despite</em> this behavior?! It's hard to say. It is a fact though that between 1945 and the late 2000s the community has grown in size and prestige. Some pieces of evidence of this are JPAA, which has found its place among the most relevant specialist journals in algebra, Street joining the EB of Advances, and some prestigious publications, say by Moerdijk, in journals of the level of Compositio. These three examples, which are far from being cherry-picked, all happened before what I would call \"the blog post era\", and ages before the \"Twitter era\".</p>\n<p>Since 2010, if anything, the community has lost in prestige and academic relevance, despite (I totally admit it) having reached a much broader audience in popularization and pop culture. The number of prestigious journals we have access to has drastically declined and is now totally restricted to Advances, JPAA is losing quite some prestige and is less and less controlled by CT-sts, it would be unimaginable nowadays to see a CT paper appear on Compositio. Yes, the community has had the HoTT sprint for a while, but that has lost quite some of its initial momentum too and -- I think --, overall, if we compare generation by generation, yours (Mike) is less prestigious than its parents, and mine is even less prestigious than yours.</p>\n<p>Now, on a more \"pop-culture\" side of the story, I agree we have gained a lot in visibility, and this is mostly due to the twitting/blogging thing I touched on previously. Has this truly benefitted our community?! That's unclear. And let me stress, this is the behavior I was calling toxic, not the one of the elder generation. In order to discuss it, let me describe it better.</p>\n<p>John, who is the person I was responding to, wrote \"category theorists, much more than say analysts, are able to state exciting snappy results that fit in a tweet\". This is indeed what happens all the time, a somewhat young and often not very expert PhD student that was nourished in mottos and nlab stories writes on Twitter that whatever all mathematicians are doing is, in fact, all trivial and reduces to the bright and somewhat magical fact that a monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors. The result? A number of narcissist crackpots enter this very zulip for a couple of weeks and then leave it, a number of young PhD students in other areas think that the PhD student is just an annoying prick (deservedly), and the PhD student grows with a strange complex of superiority which is incredibly hard to heal later in their studies. How is this <em>not</em> supposed to be toxic, I wonder. Now, I have mentioned PhD students here, but I honestly believe that a number of more senior searchers are not only themselves part of what I described, but also responsible for the behavior of their PhD students, who just repeated their attitude. </p>\n<p>All in all, am I saying that we should not try to make category theory broader in scope and more impactful on the category theory community? Of course not! We should! And I think my actions show that I am very much invested in that. Twitting \"ah-ah, you are all my pawns, because universal algebra is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors and I rule them all. Am I not the smartest?\", instead, may not be the best way to actively do healthy popularization, let alone dissemination of category theory.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You talk of (1) the place of category theory in the mathematical community and (2) the popularity of category theory on the net but don't say anything about (3) the place of category theory in computer science. The reason why I've been going into category theory is because together with type theory it provides a fundational language that can speak at the same time of computer science and mathematics. By the way, I don't have any problem with saying that category theory is a language because language is important. I see the mathematical community often hesitant to adopt this language, because they are used to the set-theory + classical logic foundation and don't want to change their habits and being told that they are not working in the right way. I see the computer science community much more open to adopt this language, because contrary to the former community, they don't already have a strong foundational language they are used to and they have only to gain into adopting this language. Some people in engineering or other applied sciences too have an open mindset towards category theory because they don't already have another foundational language they are used to and thus have mostly to gain with adopting this one.</p>\n<p>There is probably some link between the popularity of CT on the net and its use and perhaps importance in computer science. Functional progamming language like Haskell are strongly inspired by lambda calculus (ie. cartesian closed categories), or other things like functors, or monads. There are big journals and conference in computer science,  including the most prestigious ones, where a lot of work on category theory is published. I don't think the popularity of CT on the net is only a consequence of the attitude of some mathematicians on Twitter. The relation between category theory and computer science probably also plays a role. And this relation has nothing to do with the behavior of some people but is just a fact in science, human knowledge or whatever you call something that includes these two fields at the same time.</p>",

When I decided that I wanted to study category theory, thirteen years ago, the situation was quite different than it is today. It was nearly impossible to find someone with which you could study category theory as an unknown student from another university. Sure, the basics can be learned no matter what -be it with logic, algebra or else- but from MSc on things got harder and harder, to the point that finding an advisor to do a thesis \"in category theory\" was impossible -and mine was a compromise between what I could do given where I was, and what I wanted to do.<br>\nMSc in Padova had a course in representation theory, and a course in rings and modules. I was mocked by the teacher because I phrased a question I had in the language of monoidal categories. \"Mocked\" is not an exaggeration: I was literally exposed to the class as the weird guy (so, pretty low in the iceberg meme...)</p>\n<p>PhD then was pure hell, and I reserve to the majority of the people I endured during those years nothing but endless hatred and disdain. It is not an exaggeration to say that I earned a PhD degree <em>despite</em> them.</p>\n<p>At each step of this headed-down stairway it became more and more important to rely on the online community of category theorists to (maintain my mental health and) keep in touch with people doing math I cared about. I didn't succeed in the first, so I became a sociopath with an extremely high tendency to rip the jugular vein of whoever puts other people in the same situation I was in, but in order to do the second, the nLab, the n-café and other resources outside of handbooks and lecture notes and papers were nothing less than <em>essential</em> to survive as a mathematician, despite my sheer isolation.</p>\n<p>I consider my experience an exception, but I wasn't the only victim of isolation; I find miracolous that I remained in the system despite isolation, that I didn't break under that pressure. But this is another story, for another time.<br>\nI feel this aspect of the situation is changing, more and more as category theory permeates more and more the outside world, and gets \"tainted\" with other things. There is a price to pay for this, but this is another story for a different day.</p>\n<p>Your perception of the situation is, then, true in my opinion; we're few people. We struggle with recognition (CT is young, and got many people stoned -or it was something they cut it with? in its infancy; then everyone was a bit nauseated). We find refuge where we can when we are ostracized. Internet is good because it shortens the distance between people.</p>",

Same with \"how many category theorists are invited speakers at the ICM?\" and \"how many category theorists receive prestigious mathematical prizes?\", and \"how many category theorists won a Fields medal?\" In all these cases, the answer gets more and more depressing as years pass.

Voevodsky's difficulty with n-categories let him to develop homotopy type theory, and now that's been revealed to have deep connections to higher topos theory.   Alain Connes is advocating the use of topos theory in his work on the Riemann Hypothesis.   Peter Scholze's work on condensed mathematics is of great interest to category theorists, and he's even commented on the n-Category Cafe about this stuff.    There are also other rock stars who aren't Fields Medalists, notably Jacob Lurie at MIT, who revolutionized work on higher categories and higher topoi.    All this stuff is of interest to a lot of mathematicians.</p>",

In short: people who think that \"cool math is ICM math / Fields medal stuff only\" are idiots whose head is filled with tar. The responsibility to change the situation is not of a twitter star. It's <em>ours</em>, and it's the responsibility to write good books, teach well (and sneak category theory inot everything we teach), but most of all <em>the responsibility to stay in the system, get tenured and hire our colleagues</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I humbly suggest that a higher responsibility than what sounds to me like forming a mafia is to solve problems that others--and especially others in different fields-- regard as meaningful. I am not sure of any instances of this besides perhaps the cobordism hypothesis but would welcome mentions of other instances for edification.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"You should paint a hyperrealist picture instead of a cubist one, because the people who look at it find the latter meaningful.\"</p>\n<p>Do you see how ridiculous and absurd it sounds if you express the same concept like this?</p>\n<p>The point you're making implicitly assumes that category theory has something to prove to other mathematicians before being accepted as a legitimate field of study. After it has been \"solving problems that others -especially others in different fields- regard as meaningful\" for 78 years. Surprise though: the same is not required from those who deal with the theory of finite groups, or with improving of epsilon/3 an inequality that, when you consider the heat equation in 6 dimensions, says that...</p>\n<p>So no: I neither want to be \"accepted\" by non-category theorists, nor for category theory to be \"recognized as important in itself as other areas of mathematics\": instead,</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I want to be left alone while I do the mathematics that I consider important, important <em>because I say so</em>, and this judgment must be considered unquestionable as it is for many other folks;</li>\n<li>I want those who think like me to be able to do the same, without wasting a considerable part of our life, and pollute our talks with the usual pitch on <em>you wouldn't believe how useful this adjunction is to cure cancer</em>;</li>\n<li>I want to be part of a critical mass of individuals (like in other parts of mathematics, older or more popular) making 1 and 2 possible.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I equally humbly submit to you the fact that you're asking me to adapt to work on stuff that other people find interesting; why can't it be the other way round, also considering that category theorists know <em>way better than other mathematicians</em> how to recognize a deep/interesting question? The answer is one and one only: the complement set of the CT community has more soldiers, more power, more money, more influence than us.</p>\n<p>And this opens the real, huge can of snake.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I can understand where you are coming from, but I couldn't disagree more. Simply put, as a taxpayer, I would get _very_ angry in knowing that part of my money is being spent to let someone 'being left alone while I do the mathematics that I consider important, important because I say so'.</p>\n<p>You do not exist in a vacuum. Especially you do not exist in a vacuum when your bills are paid out of tax coming from other people's work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>luckily government expenditures are not made by referrendum, otherwise academia would not be funded (among many other things)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I agree with you that not everything should be decided by direct vote, indeed I do not believe direct democracy is inherently a good idea. You're preaching to the choir here. But 'justifying my existence to whoever has to decide resource allocation (it can be the university, a DAO, a bureaucrat behind a desk, does not matter)' is still needed. If you want to do mathematics (or whatever, it doesn't matter) without being bothered by justifying anything to society, then create an autarchical commune somewhere and do not rely on society at all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, I think this whole thread is just ragebait.  Of course people have to justify their work to be funded.  Whether or not people are funded too much or too little is stupid to argue about.  No one is going to give up their funding to give it to other disciplines, and everyone will continue advocating that they get more funding.</p>",

Here's an excerpt from Michelangelo's biography by Condivi (<a href=\"https://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/artdok/714/1/Davis_Fontes34.pdf\">https://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/artdok/714/1/Davis_Fontes34.pdf</a> pg 16 ):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[...] avvenne che un giorno fu dal Granacci menato al giardin de Medici à san Marco, il qual [...] havea di varie statue antiche et de figure ornato. [...] Tra le altre considerando un giorno la Testa d’un Fauno in vista già vecchio, [...] et piacendogli oltre à modo, si propose di ritrarla in marmo. [...] con tanta attentione et studio si pose a ritrarre il Fauno, che in pochi giorni lo condusse a’ perfettione, di sua fantasia suplendo tutto quello, che nel antico mancava, cioè la bocca aperta [...] con tutti i denti. In questo mezzo venendo il Magnifico per vedere à che termine fusse l’opera sua [...]  considerata primieramente l’eccellenza del opera, et havuto riguardo al età di lui, molto si maravigliò: et avenga che lodasse lopera, non dimeno mottegiando con lui, [...] oh tu hai fatto questo Fauno vecchio, et lasciatigli tutti identi. Non sai tu che à vecchi di tal età sempre ne mancha qualchuno? [...] Michelagnolo [...] restato solo, cavò un dente al suo vecchio di quei di sopra, trapanando la gingiva, come se ne fusse uscito colla radice, aspettando l’altro giorno il Magnifico, con gran desiderio. Il quale venuto, et vista la bontà et simplicità del fanciullo, molto se ne rise, ma poi stimata seco la prefettione* della cosa, et l’età di lui, come padre di tutte le virtù, si deliberò d’aiutare et favorire tanto ingegno [...]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Roughly summarized: Young Michelangelo is making a marble copy of an old faun. He sculpted the mouth with all the teeth in it. Lorenzo de Medici is impressed but remarks that old people usually lack some teeth. As soon as he walks away Michelangelo takes some teeth out of the statue, further impressing Lorenzo, which decides to give him patronage.</p>",
