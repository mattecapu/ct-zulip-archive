But I can at least offer some initial thoughts. :-)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Richard+Williamson\">Richard Williamson</a> is the current sysadmin for the nLab. He's currently working hard on a rewrite of the nForum, part of which involves writing a new Markdown parser. The current priority is to move the nLab to the cloud, and Richard feels this rewrite is a blocker for that. Once the rewrite is done, however, the move to the cloud will present opportunities for people to help out.</p>\n<p>As a result of the preceding, Richard currently doesn't have much time available to onboard people wishing to help out with nLab stuff. There are several small changes I started working on, but I reached a point where I needed further assistance from Richard, and his time constraints have meant he's been unable to do so. So I've not done much more than occasionally dealing with nLab spam.</p>\n<p>From my perspective, the nLab software needs administrative re-organisation to make it easier for others to contribute. For example, development is effectively not under version control - the <a href=\"https://github.com/ncatlab\">GitHub repos</a> are not actively used (via branches, GitHub forks, issues, pull requests etc.), but are essentially snapshot mirrors.</p>\n<p>One other thing I'd like to mention is that nLab currently makes use of Ruby (via Instiki and Ruby on Rails) and Python, and I seem to remember Richard's new parser might be in another language again, maybe C? My personal preference is that we try to avoid adding further languages to the mix, as the more languages involved, the more complex the entire system will be to maintain.</p>",
