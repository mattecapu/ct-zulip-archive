        "content": "<p>In 1986 Stephen Wolfram told me he would help me publish my research on extending tetration to the complex numbers. Fifteen years later after two failed attempts to publish, I applied my web design skills and built <a href=\"http://tetration.org\" title=\"http://tetration.org\">http://tetration.org</a> . That was twenty years ago. My sense is nothing works as advertised. For example, five years ago I noticed my research published on Wikipedia's Iterated Functions page.  In a reversal from normal, I told the editors that my research should be removed from the page because it wasn't published. Their response was, tough, we like the material. So I have unpublished research on the Wikipedia I can't get removed.</p>",
