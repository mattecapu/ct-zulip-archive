An inactive account and any content in it will be eligible for deletion from December 1, 2023.<br>\n<strong>What this means for you:</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>These changes do not impact you unless you have been inactive in your Google Account for two years or have not used your account to sign in to any Google service for over two years.</li>\n<li>While the changes go into effect today, the earliest we would enforce any account deletion would be December 2023.</li>\n<li>If your account is considered inactive, we will send several reminder emails to both you and your recovery emails (if any have been provided) before we take any action or delete any account content. These reminder emails will go out at least 8 months before any action is taken on your account.</li>\n<li>After a Google Account is deleted, the Gmail address for the deleted account cannot be used again when creating a new Google Account.</li>\n</ul>",
