The \"traditional internet format\" suffers from many the same restrictions that pdfs do. There's greater scope for interaction, but most pages about scientific subject matter largely consist of text blocks with static pictures or diagrams. If one is lucky the page author will have the facilities to format equations nicely. In a well-maintained online project (such as a community wiki) content may be well-connected in the sense that technical terms and names link to relevant other pages, and if one is really lucky the contents will be searchable...<br>\nThe most glaring thing that's absent from this format (imo) is the visibility of structure. Text and pictures will, for the foreseeable future, be the most convenient final delivery method of detailed information, but there are things about a subject I should be able to understand without having to comb through these details. I imagine a network structure, a virtual map of a subject, with nodes linking to, say, entries in a wiki. At a finer level, one could construct networks based on the results presented in a given textbooks, <em>expanding them with results that have been discovered since the book's publication</em>.</p>",

We also got the endorsement of Mathematica so that we could naively support jupiter and mathematica computational notebooks to make the publication format more expressive. We even travelled all the way to London to meet other researchers (<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"277670\">@Philipp Zahn</span>  and Andrew Lewis-Pye) in person to discuss this further, and get backed up by the LSE in the process. Well, guess what? It went nowhere. And the reason for this is that, all things considered, no one among anyone of us had the time you'd need to put into such a project. This kind of stuff, done the right way, is a thousands man hours project.

One prerequisite for that is to be able to parse mathematics written in a natural language. Some of it has been done before.</p>\n<p>Back in 2013 --- 2012/13 was pretty hectic in maths --- Tim Gowers ran a curious experiment on his blog and posted the results <a href=\"https://gowers.wordpress.com/2013/04/14/answers-results-of-polls-and-a-brief-description-of-the-program/\" title=\"https://gowers.wordpress.com/2013/04/14/answers-results-of-polls-and-a-brief-description-of-the-program/\">here</a>. It turned out to be a demo of some software written by Mohan Ganesalingam to test that his grammar of mathematics, which he developed in his <a href=\"https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783642370113\" title=\"https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783642370113\">thesis</a>, actually works.

Rather, it's that there has been a prototype that can generate natural-language proofs, which <em>presumably</em> means it may also \"understand\" natural-language proofs, in such a way that it may be possible to extract concepts and do something useful with them.</p>",

The automated aspect is just to get the system up to speed with existing research, so that people don't have to manually reproduce work they've done before. After that people would add their work directly into that structure as it relates to it, rather than being constrained to a long-form, linearly-structured format.</p>",

It requires quite a bit of hand-crafting and a lot of manual labelling. </p>\n<p>So my point was basically that we should learn to process the human-readable data we already have directly and automatically, i.e. develop better natural language processing (NLP) technology. The state of the art in NLP now is better than when Ganesalingam wrote his thesis, and there have been steps taken towards processing mathematical text as well.</p>\n<p>Where I think ACT can come in is to provide a better framework for the engineers to design better. Right now, to use an analogy with engineering and physics, people know how to build bridges that wouldn't collapse when someone walks on it, but there's no theory of mechanics yet to guide the engineers on how to build better bridges. </p>\n<p>There are embryonic theories, like Bob Coecke's DisCoCats(Circs) and the work sparked by <em>Backprop as Functor</em>. My hope is that these could blossom into some coherent theory that would help guide future work in ML/NLP.</p>",

It’s a what-you-see-is-what-you-get, it’s got (mostly) easily learnable keyboard shortcuts (hit tab a couple times from similar symbols, for instance), it has plugins for CAS and interactive in-document coding sessions, has a graphical interface for diagram drawing, and best of all, it’s GNU-licensed/open-source.

(I thought you were just being sarcastic :P )</p>\n<p>a random thought about document creation, btw: I think the formats in which we write papers and read documents ought to be interchangeable. Maybe not exactly the same; maybe you want some more stuff exposed while you’re editing, and you want to present a cleaner version to an audience. But a reader ought to be able to choose to edit your document and expose all that stuff if they want—maybe by changing the extension or changing something in the document’s metadata, or simply by opening it differently.</p>\n<p>I feel like this gives the structure of the document greater relevance, and so greater possible use (or something)—and makes our tools coincide, so we don’t have to build one thing and convert to another. It might make adding custom functionalities easier and more widespread...in an imaginary document format where adding functionalities to the document (like interactive sessions/visualizations) is already doable and easy, ofc. :) (You can write stuff like this for TeXmacs, but afaik it’s not exactly easy!)</p>\n<p>In general, I think some of the different things being talked about in this topic might “coevolve” and help each other along, and that it would be harder to instead add them piecemeal or in sequence to the current state of affairs.

It's just that they conceal too much of their logic and rhetoric. All of modern science is based on the same adversarial learning system that analytic philosophy and western law is also based on––a defeasible mode of inquiry unlike mathematics. However, many bodies of literature make it hard to process and recombine arguments from different sources because scientists aspire to be like mathematicians who conceal their problem-solving-based arguments in favor of neatly packaged results (theorems, corollaries, etc.). Unfortunately, this just leads to a mess in science because scientific results are defeasible rather than (contingently) immutable.</p>\n<p>Whenever possible, I already code papers of interest using the schemes I know (though I'm working on expanding my repertoire into statistical arguments––which would be a lot more useful). It works pretty well as a knowledge management strategy. It's not perfect, but nothing is.</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>\n</code></pre></div>",

I agree that authors can do better when it comes to academic writing. In the case of mathematics, however, the style of writing that you're not in favour of is due to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Bourbaki\">Bourbaki</a>, who has many fervent defenders: see <a class=\"stream-topic\" data-stream-id=\"229156\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/229156-practice.3A-applied-ct/topic/mathematical.20writing\">#practice: applied ct &gt; mathematical writing</a>, particularly <a href=\"#narrow/stream/229156-practice.3A-applied.20ct/topic/mathematical.20writing/near/193780562\">here</a>. </p>\n<p>Bourbaki's austere style has been much imitated, but prior to that, people wrote papers in the style you favoured, and <em>concluded</em> problem-solving arguments by packaging the results, instead of announcing them at the beginning.

They are just defeasible arguments, and the point of Walton's work was to point out how these arguments can be defeated.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Okay, any good paper should contain some motivation, which may include arguments for why a particular problem is worth looking at, of which some may be of the form \"here are some influential people who care about this\".  They should also contain relevant background material, which may include non-specific references. But these arguments should be independent of the scientific content of the paper. </p>\n<p>There is a more philosophical aspect to \"citations as appeals to authority\", though, in that no one has time to check them all. Thus any quoted result from another author (or the same author) that goes unchecked must be accepted on the basis of that author's authority alone. It's like second hand stories, or second hand evidence... If too many reported results get changed together, the literature can get very difficult to stay on top of.<br>\nAnother nice thing about building a meta-literary structure would be that cited results become \"gluing points\", and any 'real' appeals to authority are revealed as arguments which fail to be well-founded in this structure.

Also, even if there was a way to <em>unreliably</em> code papers with argument schemes, that wouldn't necessarily reflect the author's intent. It would reflect the distorted opinion––in the hyper-abstract––of the theorist who developed the method that the machine learning engineer interpreted and implemented. The two main reasons for asking people to label their arguments is (1) to get people to think about what they are arguing / address <em>more</em> critical questions / openly highlight the loose ends; and (2) to gather information about authors' intent. Neither of these goals is accomplished by a purely machine learning solution. Maybe in the future, AI can assist us in <em>using</em> argument schemes––just like CAS systems help us use numerical methods.</p>\n<p>The NLP for argument schemes idea could become useful for lit reviews, but only if people actually adopt the convention of using them first.

I agree that authors can do better when it comes to academic writing. In the case of mathematics, however, the style of writing that you're not in favour of is due to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Bourbaki\">Bourbaki</a>, who has many fervent defenders: see <a class=\"stream-topic\" data-stream-id=\"229156\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/229156-practice.3A-applied-ct/topic/mathematical.20writing\">#practice: applied ct &gt; mathematical writing</a>, particularly <a href=\"#narrow/stream/229156-practice.3A-applied.20ct/topic/mathematical.20writing/near/193780562\">here</a>. </p>\n<p>Bourbaki's austere style has been much imitated, but prior to that, people wrote papers in the style you favoured, and <em>concluded</em> problem-solving arguments by packaging the results, instead of announcing them at the beginning. I called this the \"Pokemon theorem\" style <a href=\"#narrow/stream/229156-practice.3A-applied.20ct/topic/mathematical.20writing/near/193692217\">here</a>. This style is still practiced in certain areas of computer science, and I'll take reading a CS paper over a maths one any day.</p>\n<p>There is an argument for packaging results though: it's also a kind of metadata that helps to organise the ideas in a paper.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ok this is a fair criticism of my loose rhetoric. What I meant to say is that mathematics can get away with being abstruse about its arguments because––once a result is proven––all the 'argument schemes' in mathematics can collapse to 'by proof...such and such is true'. And––if the result has truly been proven––under the assumptions for the proof, there are no further critical questions. This means mathematicians can string together results without thinking too hard about how they got them. It could have been a beautiful explanatory proof, a convoluted pedantic proof or computer generated gobbeldy-gook. A proof is a proof is a proof.</p>\n<p>I was raising the point that scientists often act like this with their citations, stringing results together, even though you can't do that for appeals to authority that are then contingent on underlying irreducibly defeasible scientific arguments.</p>",

I have a taxonomy in my head that I didn't lay out. In it, mathematics also shares a common ancestor with science, analytic philosophy and western law. It's just that the split goes back further. Mathematics has the nice closure that I mentioned above, whereas these other disciplines do not.</p>\n<p>My main point was––as I mentioned––that scientists need to account for the fact that their reasoning is defeasible (though not necessarily inductive). </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Scientific results are defeasible because they rely on inductive reasoning, which reasons backwards from effects to causes: if you are ignorant of a cause, you may be misattributing an effect to an erroneous cause. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This presupposes that your starting ontology is correct. It also presupposes that you have a coherent notion of causes in the domain in question. I don't think we can take either of these things for granted in science. It also presupposes that your choice of model is correct. Scientific induction (usually in the form of statistical tests) stand on top of a whole bunch of other reasoning that isn't inductive at all. It really depends on the field, the level of analysis, etc. Still, we agree on the main point–– that science is defeasible.</p>",

There is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_element\">metadata</a> in HTML documents that search engines read, and people have used the meta elements to do <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization\">search engine optimisation (SEO)</a> to boost their rankings in search results. </p>\n<p>You can do SEO in a variety of ways though: you can write really informative content, or you can just stuff the <code>keyword</code> attribute of meta elements with your desired keywords.

More recently, Google has cracked down a lot on the latter to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, so that people are now forced to supply useful relevant content.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is a fair point. However, I'm having a hard time thinking of how the label \"argument by [insert scheme here]\" could be abused for search optimization in a way that would add much to the abuses related to tagging and keywords. The number of useful known schemes is likely in the low hundreds, so it's a finite and repetitive set.

They have every incentive to do so, because getting ahead in their academic careers depends on gaining visibility.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As for the reproducibility crisis and p-hacking (which you also mentioned elsewhere). This is one of the main reasons why I like argumentation schemes. I wish that statistical tests were presented in the form of formal arguments and labeled schemes so that people could detect fishy rhetoric. While this would not directly address p-hacking, the it's <em>probably</em> fair to say that––often––the kinds of people who p-hack are the kinds of people who use sketchy or lazy reasoning. If the rhetoric was brought to the center, peoples critical thinking skills would kick in more. Non-statisticians could catch many errors that only experts currently see.</p>\n<p>Also, let's be honest, a lot of the research claiming to 'debunk' whole disciplines relies fishy interpretations of the original studies. Very little attention gets paid to the competence of debunkers' interpretation of the experimental procedures they try to reproduce. Both parties would benefit from making their arguments were more explicit. Researchers could convey the most important parts of their research in a way that would allow replicators to correctly identify the crux of their experimental designs; and replicators would be constrained to justify their choices when attempting to reproduce the work.</p>",

I don't claim that the replication crisis is a justification for \"debunking\" entire disciplines, just that it's a systemic problem, one that will dog those disciplines and fuel political attacks for a long time.</p>\n<p>However, there are certain schools of thought that need debunking, and people may have used the word \"debunking\" to highlight legitimate grave concerns. For example, the school of thought in economics known as \"marginalism\" historically, and \"neoclassical economics\" to its critics, is founded on many flawed <em>mathematical</em> premises which, many critics have argued, completely invalidates many of its conclusions and frameworks. </p>\n<p>Yet, it is alleged, the prestigious journals in economics routinely reject papers that don't adhere to this school of thought, which is why people like Steve Keen have written books like <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debunking_Economics\">Debunking Economics</a></em>. Now, Keen isn't debunking <em>his own</em> discipline: he's just criticising the dominant school of thought, and arguing for a better mathematical foundation for economics. </p>\n<p>Of course, I'm biased here as I'm sympathetic to his work, but I think some of the \"debunking\" out there isn't necessarily done in bad faith simply because it comes across as hostile.</p>",

Period. I think I wasn't clear about what my argument was intended to convey. I was suggesting only that being familiar with a method––knowing <em>how</em> to do the essentials by hand––is a prerequisite for any automated assistance to even be useful. In fact, my–– and your––lack of fluency in argumentation schemes is precisely why these misapprehensions keep happening (even with my sporadic efforts to correct this deficit). I'm not following my own advice in the fast pace of a chat because I still haven't really built the foundations of thinking that way. The best I'm capable of right now is coding papers according to standards nobody taught me––very slowly. (Automating parts of my manual process would be very useful. Removing me from the process would probably just make me a worse thinker.)</p>\n<p>So I'm not saying everybody should follow the exact same method. \"Lack of rigor\" as you both have interpreted it is certainly not always a disadvantage. However, I'm suggesting that, especially at this early stage of adoption, knowing and using argumentation schemes manually is more important than automating any one part of the process––just like knowing and using calculus is more important than automating its use (though that certainly is important at this late stage of wide adoption). I also think automating the whole process would defeat the purpose of using them. It would be just another way to generate reports that nobody is proficient enough to use well.</p>",

What's missing here is the training needed to ensure widespread adoption amongst researchers, and the enforcement (that's supposed to come through peer review, but isn't) of best practices in publication.</p>\n<p>What's <em>not</em> desirable, however, is to institute yet another checkbox that the researcher must tick, and manually at that, in order to get published. Researchers who already have training in argumentation will find this tedious and patently unnecessary. The point at which such training should take place is in the formative stage of a researcher's education, and NOT during the publication process, where the focus should instead be on enforcing those argumentation standards. This enforcement is perhaps best done with the aid of automation, because it's tedious and repetitive.</p>\n<p>I understand that you have a pedagogical objective in mind, which is well and good, but it shouldn't involve making researchers code up metadata about argumentation schemes, because it's about as silly as asking people who routinely perform a lot of calculations in their daily work not to use a calculator or a spreadsheet.</p>",

I think I've been clear in stating that I think the intent of the author is a red herring. The author being merely human --- and thus subject to various cognitive biases, which cannot be readily corrected by an external agent, that'd lead to unreliable coding --- is enough for my argument. This is why I'd prefer a machine, which plays the role of an independent agent in this situation, to do that coding.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The two main reasons for asking people to label their arguments [...]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think it's a great idea to train people to use argument schemes for their own private refinements of their thought. We could also advocate clearer writing styles that makes the schemes manifest, so that NLP tools can more easily infer these schemes from processing the papers. This is how to reduce the friction in the process.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Let's fill out the context here:<br>\nBetween the two quotes you cited I said this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Also, even if there was a way to unreliably code papers with argument schemes, that wouldn't necessarily reflect the author's intent. It would reflect the distorted opinion––in the hyper-abstract––of the theorist who developed the method that the machine learning engineer interpreted and implemented. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Clearly a machine isn't an \"independent agent\" just because it is a machine. Machines reflect the biases of those who code them and those who devise the methods used by those who code them. There is no such thing as an objective third party in the context of adversarial learning. The objective part comes in <em>after</em> scientists have built a quorum consensus about what an experiment or observation would mean––only then do results speak as the objective third party.</p>\n<p>I think this point is really important in the question of how to use these tools because this misconception is a huge problem among technologists. We seriously need to stop letting people launder their opinions through algorithmic implementations (or mathematical models for that matter!). Clarifying what real scholars mean to say is the only way to converge on scientific conclusions. While it's true that the artful misinterpretation of others' ideas can be a great source of innovation, the only reason that works is because the new authors' intent improves on the old authors' intent. It still boils down to authors' intent.</p>\n<p>In my view, any attempt to reform scientific rhetoric will be dead from the start if begin with this well-debunked premise from the old technocratic political movement. </p>\n<p>On the other hand, I think it's great that you want to automate argumentation coding. I would certainly use and (if I can) contribute to such a project. I don't want to discourage it. I just want to convince you that if you don't convince people to <em>use the convention by hand</em>, there will be no cultural support, and your labor will be for naught.

That doesn't mean, however, that we have to require users to do those corrections by hand every time they need to use GPS.

If I could personally specify what my priorities are and get coherent abstracts for use in my personal investigations, that would be a huge boon for anybody who has lit to write review. I just also think that the task of writing an abstract is sufficiently ambiguous that it makes sense to let the author determine what to highlight in that part of the document.

If a \"independent committee\" wrote everybody's abstract, I would raise the same objection. This isn't about algorithms vs other forms of top-down management. It's about allowing authors to say what they think is important, even if some authors are incompetent or dishonest. The paper is right next to the abstract. The risk of dishonest authors involves you being annoyed they wasted your time when you skim the paper. The risk of removing authors from summarizing their own work is that you introduce systematic bias into the whole process. The same risk would apply to letting committees write abstracts. Reviewers already introduce enough systematic bias into that process.

My evidence is the graveyard of similar projects.

My insistence on providing a good user experience subsumes the time-saving argument, which is also implicit in the arguments of Jules and Morgan. The resistance from mathematicians that I referred to earlier is there precisely because they don't perceive any competitive advantage from participating in the formalisation of maths.</p>",

By an \"abstract\", I mean an objectively accurate summary of claims and arguments made in the document. By \"objectively accurate\", I mean that the summary agrees with the consensus arrived at by experts in the field regarding what the claims and arguments of the document are, based solely on the text and ignoring any issues of experimental replicability at this point. By this standard, most abstracts currently fall short of the mark, because they depend too much on the authors' opinions on what to highlight in their document.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You might disagree with the authors' choices, and that's where your tool could become useful. As a computer assisted qualitative analysis tool.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Agreed. However, I think it can also be a tool to assist authors (who wish to act in good faith) as well, by helping them to check that they are indeed claiming and arguing what they intend to claim and argue.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think we've found the crux of our disagreement. If I'm understanding you correctly, you think there is such a thing as an \"objectively accurate summary\" of a document. Now this is a subtle issue and I don't <em>entirely</em> disagree. I think that a document can be compressed to a point without making any controversial decisions about what to leave out... But I think an abstract is, by design, too short to be considered an \"objective\" compression of the paper. My understanding is that an abstract ––usually a single paragraph––is far too short for its author (whether it's a person or an algorithm) avoid <em>controversial</em> decisions about what to include. It simply is not possible to make an \"objective\" abstract. I don't think that experts could ever come to a consensus about the particular choices made for writing any given abstract. They would likely come to agree that while some of the decisions are normative, many of the decisions are individual / discretionary.</p>\n<p>My conclusion, then, is that––since academic discourse is centered around the intellectual property of its contributors (not in the monetary sense, but in the credit sense)––the rightful owner of the abstract is the author of the paper. Hence, the author should have the final say as to what goes into his or her abstract.</p>\n<p>Having said this,  I think that one could check how <em>accurate</em> an abstract is––in a very literalistic sense. That is to say, one could check for lies of commission, but not lies of omission.  One could also measure how comprehensive an abstract is. One could ask \"compared to the smallest possible objective summary, how many claims made it into this abstract?\" However, the latter metric wouldn't necessarily tell us much about how \"good\" the abstract is. Depending on the size of the paper and the priorities of the author / publishers, standards of comprehensiveness would vary. If we had tools to measure those things, it would be a great tool for reviewers. I can imagine a new wave of desk rejections on the grounds of false claims in abstracts. Access to such a tool could also make writing accurate abstracts much easier. I'll bet a lot of scientists would make tweaks based on a grammarly-like abstract checking tool. I'll bet it would also lead to a wave of algorithm hacking, just like people resume hack due to the use of algorithms by hiring managers. But maybe it could still be an improvement.</p>",

I do NOT mean the claims, arguments and factual observations made by the authors in the course of their scientific work that are recorded in the paper.
