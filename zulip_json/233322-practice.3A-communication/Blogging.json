Here's <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/forget-ferguson-s-personal-failures-it-s-his-science-that-needs-scrutiny\">one</a> by James Ball (who's written for the Guardian) that looks like it could be politically motivated, but actually makes a good case that scrutiny is good for science. I don't think the Telegraph is considered credible to the people who'd defend Ferguson on this. Certainly, the coverage in the newspapers is lopsided from what I can tell.</p>\n<p>One of my points that got lost in the shuffle is that good practices tend to fall by the wayside when people face resource constraints. So Sue Denim's proposal actually aggravates the problem it purports to solve, by perpetuating the Matthew effect. As I've said earlier, the best defence is a good offence: the better route is to argue, through a detailed analysis of the causes that led to bad practices in scientific coding, that this problem <em>justifies</em> more funding, not less. Morgan's anecdotes in the other thread are a good place to start.</p>",
