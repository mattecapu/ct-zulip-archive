Right?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I had to reflect on what I meant here as well.  I read your statements as saying that </p>\n<ol>\n<li>your intuitive / high level understanding comes first, then </li>\n<li>the technical details get worked out, and finally </li>\n<li>your post-details understanding then emerges, being at least functorially related to the pre-details understanding.  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>I realize you did not actually say (3) though, and I realize thats what I think of as \"mastery\"; it implies a fast converging sequence.</p>\n<p>I also proceed from a high level / intuitive understanding first.  But kind of like what James describes I go through many many iterations of big picture --&gt; small picture before I finally have the details correct, if indeed I succeed.  I make a <em>lot</em> of mistakes, though.  Sometimes the process never converges.  </p>\n<p>So my experience of what constitutes \"understanding\" is more an active process of constantly applying error correction algorithms / processes to catch these inevitable mistakes.  \"Does the answer, obtained via composed details, match my intuition?  Which one needs updating?\" etc.</p>\n<p>Where LLMs help, at least in how I use them programming, is that it greatly increases the <em>rate</em> at which I can apply the high-level error-correction steps.</p>\n<p>AI, whether LLMs or other, are having a negative effect on crafts-people: those who are very skilled in the execution of a craft, and do not want to disengage to work at a level less-engaging of those skills.  </p>\n<p>And. I think they are having a positive impact on people who have (a) more ideas than (b) time*skill to implement them.  </p>\n<p>Understanding for the person engaging in the latter modality is supported by retaining the independent capacity for (c) critical evaluation of the implementation, and (d) honing core skills necessary for independent verification.  (How to determine what constitutes core skills is a much larger discussion.)</p>\n<p>Perhaps it is at least partly that students have not been previously taught or practiced (c) that Morgan is observing in the effects of AI on his students?  At least I've often found that lacking in common education.</p>",

I must ask though, do you use buildings and aidewalks built with concrete?  </p>\n<p>Likely, you use infrastructure with embodied carbon costs on a daily basis.  The training of LLMs increase atmospheric pCO2 because the training uses energy, and that energy mix is dominated by fossil fuels, which are almost never burned applying carbon capture-at-source technology.

But human beings might well let AI make them stupid enough to believe that their own intelligence is obsolete.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think she makes many good points.  And I respectfully disagree with one of her statements.</p>\n<p>\"\"\"<br>\n[AI] can calculate and process superbly well, but it cannot reason, judge, or empathize at all.<br>\n\"\"\"</p>\n<p>I think this is a category error?  AI can definitely \"act as if judging\": it can seemingly choose which features to ignore and which to focus on when implementing test-suites / QA for software.  It can even suggest an implementation path for a proof or a software project.  I might <em>disagree</em> with those assessments, but sometimes they are correct, and either way demonstrate the capacity.</p>\n<p>I think we should never make the mistake of confusing our subjective experience of a capability (reason / empathy / whatever) with the external observation of another system which may (or may not) be engaging that capability.  </p>\n<p>That is, pulled back to qualia, we should not confuse sympathy with empathy.  This is commonly done to autistic people by those more neurotypical:  \"oh they cannot empathize\" ... yet Temple Grandin (a quite successful autist) has displayed perhaps the greatest level of empathy I have seen documented: she was able to understand from a cow's perspective what the experience of going through a slaughterhouse was like, and what aspects made it stressful / not stressful, then reduce those aspects.  Its a macabre example, but I hope it illustrates the point.  </p>\n<p>For me, mathematics is very empathic, but it involves no humans on the other side at all... it is more like feeling how the mathematical concepts must experience things on their own terms.  I am no great mathematician, so maybe others would regard this as a poor substitute for however they process, but I still suggest our common understanding of empathy is ill-posed and probably wrong. </p>\n<p>I think an LLM when reacting to a misunderstanding of a concept by its human interlocutor, and adopting the terminology and values of the human in order to explain this misunderstanding, might well be engaging in empathy.  Wether this is \"actually\" so requires solving problems Turing himself felt it better to leave side, that is figuring out exactly how our qualia (our subjective experience) maps to external observations of consciousness / intelligence / empathy.</p>\n<p>I do agree with her that we expose children to screens and technology at too young an age, generally, and I love her description of history as empathy.  But I am not so sure that an AI is incapable of these things at all, though OpenAI et al. may be penalizing those responses to avoid self-involved loops.</p>\n<p>None of this touches directly on wether AI is good or bad for math or human understanding, but I do think there is an important difference between the felt experience, and the observation of another's felt experience.  Mirror neurons, and sympathy, theory of mind, etc. lessen the distance between those two things, and presumably were reinforced by evolution allowed us to cooperate, but we shouldn't make the error of presuming for instance, that plants cannot feel pain just because they do not express it as we do.  (They do react to stimuli!  Just more slowly.)  </p>\n<p>Similarly, I wonder if there is as much distance here between AI and human regarding empathy and reason... perhaps the enemies of reason and empathy: trauma, chauvinism/contempt, and unawareness of subtlety, or lack of care, understood categorically, will play a great role in wether AI is a tool for good or evil, as the uncategorified versions have in humans' own experiences and history.  (Which is perhaps why I'm trying to get the people here to not outright dismiss this technology, because then surely the outcomes will be worse.)</p>",

It shouldn't be the sole responsibility of any social group to stand up for themselves.</p>\n<p>I didn't think you (<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"280788\">@Eric M Downes</span> )  had ill intent, and I appreciate your efforts to make it even clearer that you did not. Rather, it seemed to me you didn't think through the implications of what you were saying in the original message. Since I didn't spell those out (in spite of claiming to be \"perfectly clear\") allow me to do so now.</p>\n<p>A \"harmful stereotype\" is not called as such because it merely risks direct insult to its target, but rather because it reinforces an association which typically has no inherent basis in reality. Even when disavowed, the statement of a harmful stereotype builds acceptance of the premise that there is a <em>possibility</em> of the association being justified; this is largely a psychological effect, since the statement in isolation doesn't explicitly imply this premise(*). The idea that an individual can serve as a representative of a group in either illustrating or countering a stereotype, as in your example of an individual with autism displaying empathy, is reasoning that rests on this accepting of the premise and is consequently flawed. Unfortunately, this particular stereotype is prevalent enough that people with autism regularly feel under pressure to disprove it (the first reaction when I mentioned this conversation to a neurodivergent friend was to point me to a video by a creator with autism explaining how they express empathy...) The exchange above about how people with autism perceive themselves is another example of potential harm.</p>\n<p>It is difficult to sensitively address and counteract these nuances when bringing up harmful stereotypes, especially in the context of a discussion whose focus is on something else. Let's consider that context: you (<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"280788\">@Eric M Downes</span> ) were discussing the subjective experiences of agents (term intended to include humans and AI) and in particular their capacity for empathy, a trait with a strong association with humanity. In this context, you were tracing the philosophical boundary between those who do/can experience empathy and those who do not. You evoked the stereotype that autistic people cannot empathise as an instance of there being some doubt cast on which side of the boundary some <em>actual people</em> might lie. It seems to me that <strong>the relevance of this stereotype to the discussion directly rests on the validity of this doubt.</strong> Since you don't seem to think that these doubts <em>are</em> valid, bringing up the stereotype therefore adds little to the discussion, at the expense of the side-effects I describe above.</p>\n<p>Summarising your argument in broader terms, <span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"278008\">Spencer Breiner</span> <a href=\"#narrow/channel/233322-practice.3A-communication/topic/To.20AI.20or.20not.20to.20AI.20and.20related.20questions/near/520775213\">said</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It seems like you acknowledge the existence of a \"harmful stereotype\". If people are/can be bad at ascribing empathy to other people, isn't that germane to the discussion of whether we ascribe it to machines?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think this is a good point in isolation, and I tend to believe that there are plenty of examples of social norms which mischaracterize the emotional and intellectual experiences of non-humans. However, it is again the context that troubled me: Eric was communicating a belief that there is <em>evidence</em> that machines are capable of empathy. In parallel, he presented an example of one individual displaying empathy as evidence against a stereotype. The notion that people with autism would need to provide evidence of their capacity for empathy is the very thing that is dehumanizing about the stereotype. If it were me, I would also be insulted to be compared so directly to machines, that kind of comparison also having dehumanizing implications.</p>\n<p>Taken individually, the harm done by mere mention of a stereotype is negligible, but harm is cumulative (c.f. the more overt notion of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression\">microaggression</a>).</p>\n<p>(*) This an effect which is often exploited by those skilled at rhetoric to give themselves plausible deniability. A similar effect is that of \"just asking questions\".</p>",
