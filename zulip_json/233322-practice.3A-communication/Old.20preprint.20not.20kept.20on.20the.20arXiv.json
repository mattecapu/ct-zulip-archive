Brylinski's book cites a 1992 Aarhus University preprint for a result, and lo and behold it's on the arXiv, and one of the authors even has a pdf on his website, of the published version. However, it was published in 2000, and the copy on the arXiv is v2 (from 2000), and the v1 copy <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/alg-geom/9202023v1\">https://arxiv.org/abs/alg-geom/9202023v1</a> (from 1992) is not there! The note on the paper on the arXiv says how it was updated, and a theorem got downgraded to a conjecture.  Not the bit I needed, I think, which was a construction, but this construction is very hard to spot in the v2, to the point I'm not sure it's even there.</p>",
