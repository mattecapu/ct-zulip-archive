An additional nice advantage of a digital whiteboard  over a physical one is that you can copy and past stuff on the board (which comes in very handy if you are doing a lot of string diagram rewriting).<br>\nThe problem is that all the whiteboard apps we came across so far either don't work well on one of our devices (for example, <a href=\"http://www.excalidraw.com\">excalidraw</a> works great on my windows laptop / tablet, but not so well on his iPad) or the performance of the synchronization is poor  (<a href=\"https://www.goodnotes.com/\">goodnotes</a>, for example, works well on both our devices, but when one party writes / draws something, it takes up to several seconds for the other party to see it).</p>\n<p>Does anyone know a whiteboard app which works well on both Windows and iOS devices and allows actual real-time synchronization? It would be preferable if it also recognized pen buttons for erasing / selecting content on both devices.</p>",
