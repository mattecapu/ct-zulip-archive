Either AI papers are SoTA crackpotty junk that a reviewer can spot by quickly skimming the paper, or they are significantly better at pretending to be substantial. In the first case, if someone is willing to submit such slop I doubt they would self-denounce AI usage, so you would end up reviewing these papers anyway. In the second case, the incentive to lie and pass the work as yours is much higher, and you would end up revieweing these papers anyway.</p>\n<p>In any case, asking people to 'not do the bad thing' is usually quite useless to stop them from doing the bad thing. Instead, incentive and reputation systems can be used to shape behaviour, and academia has long relied (with varying results) on such systems. Citation metrics and networking are ways to measure and boost your reputation in a field, which is ultimately what makes your science relevant (<em>if someone proves the abc conjecture in a forest and no one is there to hear, did they actually prove it?</em>), and people are disincentivized from dabbling in scientific fraud because they know they are going to completely burn their reputation if caught.</p>\n<p>So I think the solution to the rising tide of AI slop is to build reputation networks we can trust: have public lists of authors which are known to be fraudolent, make submissions conditional to a reference (like arXiv does), etc. These are not perfect systems and I'm just pointing in a general direction: we should be very careful to avoid gatekeeping real people from disadvantaged/nontraditional backgrounds.

SCIENCE IS EVER-PROPER ALIGNMENT OF REASON WITH EXPERIENCE.<br>\nWhat's your understanding of science, just to make sure we are on the same page (same level of abstraction ;)</p>\n<p>P.P.S.  What's true of mathematics need not be so of language in general (as you all know):<br>\nFor example, the condition for syllogistic reasoning and composition of functions is the same as in domain(2nd function) = codomain(1st function), which gives us the composite function: domain(1st function) --&gt; codomain(2nd function).  So is the case with syllogistic reasoning: Apples are Fruits AND Fruits are Edible = Apples are Edible.  But we run into trouble when try to abstract statistically.  For instance: Apples are Fruits AND Mangoes are Yellow = Apples are Yellow is one possible \"wrong\" abstraction, which we can correct by structuring reinforcement learning to make the system recognize the condition: subject(2nd proposition) = object(1st proposition).  Even after this corrective measure, there is still a possibility of error: Apple is red AND Red is stop-signal = Apple is stop-signal.  Note that we don't have these problems with composition of functions, which raises the possibility of statistical abstraction of the architecture of mathematics (for all mathematical objects and operations are universal mapping properties, i.e., the best / energy minimum configurations).</p>",

        "content": "<p>Its worth observing that many of these problems with AI are magnifications of existing challenges in academia, and larger society.  The demand for referees already outstrips the system's ability to compensate referees, and so we already have seen a rise in fake papers, low quality journals, etc. over the past 2 decades. (Bogdanov affair, endless bs Elsevier journals, etc)  The very fact that Elsevier is <em>still profiting</em> at the expense of academics, while referees go uncompensated and increasingly oversubscribed, shows just how bad things are even before AI: everyone knows its a bad Nash equilibrium, but no really effective means of disintermediation has been worked out.  </p>\n<p>So, sadly, I believe science will continue to lose some ground here, and the next decade will promote a really hard look at what is truly important, and what was merely aspirational, in terms of values in academia and science more broadly.</p>\n<p>IIRC the question of how to maintain the public's trust and respect for mathematics, when Maths' distinguishing value is rigor, leading to high reliability -- while increasingly it is felt to be growing harder to quickly detect errors by mathematicians in proofs -- was one of Voevodsky's more pragmatic motivations for an interest in computer-aided proof, and tangentially, in univalence / HoTT.  Those who knew him may correct this understanding of mine, but that is what I have been told.</p>\n<p>I would submit this is not wrong?  If Coq / Lean / Agda were better developed many journals might start to encourage formalization of at least part of the mathematics of a paper's content, especially for publication by unpublished authors, or papers reviewers admit they did not really understand.  This would draw attention to the parts of the proof that are not formalized, that most need careful review.  It also forces would-be spammers to contribute something adjacent for which it <em>is</em> easier to verify correctness. Currently we cannot even approach this in category theory etc. because not enough has been done to extend the reach of mathlib etc. and perhaps that gap can never be overcome or is more fundamental than I am making it out to be... I think that is an empirical question.  But this is also only a single means of interdiction against AI-slop.</p>\n<p>So. I would encourage the people who are the most opposed to AI to please work on discovering not just how these tools can be used to <em>attack</em> the ideals you seek to defend, but also how they can help you to <em>defend</em> them.  You will have to move out of your comfort zone to do so (that is, you may have to fight the urge to rage quit after interacting with AI) but IMO the sooner you do so, the sooner you can fight back effectively.  Perhaps start where it is comfortable -- teach Claude 4 / Gemini 2.5 about your area of expertise, as you would a student, and observe the similarities and differences, then experiment with which prompts can be used to increase its level of rigor.  But I believe an absolutist moral stance (\"AI is yucky, we should view it primarily as a threat\") will ultimately backfire, here.</p>",

And then the question becomes: how much patience and skill will mathematicians need to have, to interact with AIs in order to formalize their work?   Will the AIs ever go through the massive backlog of existing papers and try to formalize those, or will they remain as a kind of stratum of unrecovered material?</p>\n<p>I'm not posing this questions as some sort of rhetorical argument: I'm just thinking about them.</p>",

For a while, the consensus seemed to be that in software, you needed to get one automated system to trust another, which can be achieved with e.g. really long Coq proofs.

(Thanks <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"280788\">@Eric M Downes</span> also for reopening it.)<br>\nTeaching computer science I have witnessed first-hand how AI is used to avoid the work required for understanding and so is actively eroding understanding in the upcoming generation of students. I do not believe it is necessary to accept AI tools, especially to accept the tools that exist today largely produced by tech companies I hold in extremely low esteem. I have colleagues working on AI in proof-checking etc. whom I trust will eventually make AI tools that benefit the science community and society directly, to the extent that this is possible, rather than improving the value of products built for profit that even our governments are trying to bash us over the head with. In the mean time, I do not intend to engage with AI any more than is necessary to understand how to design exercises it cannot yet complete accurately on students' behalf, to make teaching feasible.</p>",

        "content": "<p>rather than “AI” in general I feel we're mostly talking about LLMs here, and there's one huge blind spot that's been glossed over in this recent discussion: the human and environmental impacts that this trend causes. Every single minuscule improvement in models like ChatGPT or Claude is made at the expense of very real people classifying all the training information for a handful of bucks in the global south, often being exposed to harmful material, with no way of speaking out publicly since they are under NDAs. Global computing resources are being built at a much higher speed, and the materials necessary for building the chips are being extracted faster and from more places, leading countries trying to follow the LLM boom to lessen their environmental commitments (which tech companies have already abandoned). This is just a re-enactement of the extractism tendencies of yore with a new coat of paint.</p>",
