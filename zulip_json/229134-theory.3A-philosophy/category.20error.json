        "content": "<p>The word \"category\" has unfortunately been quite commonly adopted in academic jargon, sometimes in ways that are hard to relate to the sense of the word in which we use it here. However, the expression 'category error', referring to a misapplication of a word or a misunderstanding of the concept to which a word/phrase refers, could actually bridge the gap. For example, if I have two categories have the same objects but different morphisms, I might accidentally take a product or other construction in the wrong category, and this is a very concrete example of a category error (in both senses of that phrase!)<br>\nAbstracting this, in situation when we can think of a property or concept as a construction (an object, morphism, limit...) in or on a particular category, a category error consists precisely of a mistake about which category is being referred to, and so drawing an erroneous conclusion or performing an erroneous calculation. I don't know the extent to which this can give new insights, but I found it satisfying to realise.</p>",

Suppose I consider the collection of roads in a city as a category (there might be one-way systems, so not necessarily a groupoid), the <em>city-map category</em>. If a tourist asks me for directions to a particular landmark, my response will correspond to a morphism from my current position to their proposed destination.<br>\nHowever, there are a bunch of category errors that could occur in this situation, especially if the tourist is a non-native speaker of English or a child. They could ask me directions to something intangible (eg \"love\"), to an ambiguous location (eg \"the museum\"), to a place such as \"the university\" which doesn't really denote a specific building/position (eg if someone in the centre of Cambridge asked \"which way to the university?\", the answer would be \"it's all around you\"). In each case, they still expect the answer to have the same form, of a morphism in the city-map category, and this is the category error.</p>",
