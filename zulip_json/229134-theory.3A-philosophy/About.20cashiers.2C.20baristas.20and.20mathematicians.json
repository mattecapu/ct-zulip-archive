Human cashiers are kept probably because in some situations it would be impractical for customers to scan every single item they purchase.  But there are stores that switched to full automation: the sporting goods store Decathlon has these crazy automatic cash registers in which you do not need to manually scan anything, you just randomly throw the items one by one in a basket.  Human staff intervenes only if there's a problem (which has never happened to me so far, amazingly).</p>\n<p>Then I went on saying that, more generally, in the current socio-economical model, the large-scale development and deployment of technological advances is, with few exceptions, driven by profit, not by a desire to actually increase the well-being of people.  In these conditions, whenever a human costs less than a machine, the industry will go for the human.  I don't think that the main reason why we got large language models passing the Turing test before we got coal-mining or tomato-picking robots is that developing the latter is inherently harder than the former.  It has more to do, I think, with the fact that a slave costs less than a robot.</p>",

We're going to learn if there is something really specific to human intelligence. Is there a principle of pure creation that only human beings are able to use or not? </p>\n<p>Maybe it will be something that goes against determinism. I like to think that if the whole world is governed by deterministic principles, then we are not really free of our acts because our mental states are determined by the ones one second before, our whole environment and the laws of physics. In this case, we think that we make choices, but this is at the end an illusion. We are living the process of making this choice, but it is not really determined by us. If there is a creative principle which is not something deterministic, it would be something that we don't understand for the moment.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, I also like trying to understand humans as artificial intelligences which is more original. Sometimes people are acting in a way that seems impossible to understand to us. For instance, they use a mailing list to communicate instead of speaking in a nice adapted online environment like this Zulip. Why are they doing this? Because they have learned to communicate on the mailing list and even if it's a quite obsolete system, they continue because their brains are programmed to think that it is good. </p>\n<p>Sadly, this vision of humans as artificial intelligence seems closer to the reality that an undeterministic creative principle specific to humans but I don't know. We'll discover later if we are just very complicated machines or not.

How does it spend its time when it is \"all alone by itself\"?  Currently, these questions do not really make sense.  As long as they won't make sense, we will not have artificial general intelligence, I think.  Not in the sense that I will not consider it as such, but in the sense that it will lack a fundamental feature allowing it to \"grow\" beyond predicting answers to prompts (in particular, doing mathematics!).

The prompt is thus a local section that gets extended by the LLM. (So OK, we are dealing with a cosheaf if you don't feel like taking an opposite.) By construction, each local section of N-1 words followed by the predicted word is reasonably coherent. But for any hard prompt that it really tries to answer, the local sections will decohere because the LLM cannot actually reason about its input or output. I.e., the sequence of words can be coherently extended locally, but not globally: while the syntax of the output is globally fine, the semantics is not, because the LLM doesn't actually know anything about that and they forget whatever's outside their window. Poetry doesn't require global reasoning, or any reasoning at all. The LLM just extends snippets based on other snippets it's seen.</p>",

In other words, a sonnet fits within a \"local section\".  If you're window is the length, say, of a whole book, then who knows what you can do...  Maybe that's what LeCun's new approach allows us to do?</p>\n<p>By the way, proofs only need be locally consistent, in the sense that the validity of a proof may be checked by looking at each single inference rule.

On the one hand, writers, artists, musicians, intellectuals, bon vivants and their financiers met in the coffee house, and on the other hand, new coffee varieties were always served. In the coffee house, people played cards or chess, worked, read, thought, composed, discussed, argued, observed and just chatted. A lot of information was also obtained in the coffee house, because local and foreign newspapers were freely available to all guests. This form of coffee house culture spread throughout the Habsburg Empire in the 19th century.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Scientific theories</strong>, political plans but also artistic projects were worked out and discussed in Viennese coffee houses all over Central Europe. James Joyce even enjoyed his coffee in a Viennese coffee house on the Adriatic in Trieste, then and now the main port for coffee and coffee processing in Italy and Central Europe. From there, the Viennese Kapuziner coffee developed into today's world-famous cappuccino.

Fifteen years later, four other Armenians owned coffeehouses.  The culture of drinking coffee was itself widespread in the country in the second half of the 18th century.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The story goes back a little bit further:</p>\n<p><em>The history of Viennese coffee house culture is closely linked to the end of the Siege of Vienna in 1683. Legend has it that the Viennese citizen Georg Franz Kolschitzky (1640 - 1694) was the first to obtain a licence to serve coffee in the city following his heroic actions during the Siege of Vienna. The coffee beans left behind by the Turks were the basis of his success.</em> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wien.gv.at/english/culture-history/viennese-coffee-culture.html\">https://www.wien.gv.at/english/culture-history/viennese-coffee-culture.html</a></p>",

For this reason unless we start getting really aggressive AI people who are spreading disinformation and gushing about human level AI in the next five years replacing all of us by bots, I think that it is better not to make statements like \"LLM's are fundamentally incapable of XYZ because of their architecture.\" It is certainly true that deep neural networks do not have clear ways to store symbolic knowledge and apply symbolic derivation rules reliably in the way a theorem prover or SQL database does. However, neither does the human brain.<br>\nAs unfortunate as it is, humans also make mistakes, typos, mis-speak, talk nonsense, and some of us suffer from schizophrenia, hallucinations, delusions, and so on. We also, regrettably, sometimes talk complete bullshit confidently. Nevertheless we have \"achieved so much - the wheel, New York, wars and so on\" (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy quote) and so in general I would expect LLM's to be extremely useful if we can reduce the hallucinations and confident bullshit by an order of magnitude or so. In my view the most serious danger from AI right now (and of course it is already ongoing) is a collective business/managerial decision that the increase in \"productivity\" from using ChatGPT is worth the hallucinations and bullshit in the final document and so we see a general reduction in quality of consumer programs, Stack Overflow answers and so on as unvetted ChatGPT material makes its way into source code and other materials.</p>\n<p>But as for mathematics, if we can hook them up to theorem provers which do verify the correctness of proofs then the unreliability will not be an issue. The technology is not at the point where they can discover correct proofs reliably but people are already writing papers on closed loop systems where the neural network either steers the guidance of the proof search by heuristically choosing the most likely next step in the proof or generates the entire proof. Then the error messages from Coq get fed back into ChatGPT, it obsequiously responds \"You're right! How clumsy of me. This next proof will _surely_ be correct:\" and so on in a loop. You would hope that after a few hundred iterations of this it eventually stumbles across a correct proof, if the theorem is simple enough, and I have no problems with that kind of application.</p>\n<p>To return to your original post, talking about \"fundamental limits of iteratively predicting the next word\" is fine but it is best to write down a clear formulation of the problem and rigorously work out what kind of problems can and cannot be reduced to next token prediction, rather than just saying \"of course it's glorified autocomplete, how can we solve real substantial problems with it?\" <br>\nI think this paper is a good-faith effort to formulate the next-token prediction problem computationally and link it to other problems in computational complexity theory, which helps us in getting a good sense of what it can and cannot do.<br>\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06979.pdf\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.06979.pdf</a></p>",

Of course you could object here at treating a continuous system as a discrete one, but we communicate right now by transmitting packets of discrete bits over continuous sinusoidal representations of voltage levels (or light intensities if you have fiberoptic internet) so this is not a fatal objection, only adding additional complexity.<br>\nSo the question is more like: what kinds of functions can be approximated by a finite state machine |Sigma|^N -&gt; Sigma?
