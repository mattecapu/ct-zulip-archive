But it is not easy. I think it took a very long time for co-algebras to be understood (it looks like a lot of the work there started in the 1990ies), even though it was know that there was a dual. The opposite category is not just a simple mirror image, it's something strongly related but very different. So as CT theory gains ground it could help people translate their knowledge from on system to the other, and so at some point in the future the psychological gaps may no longer be so deep. Perhaps children will be taught in schools to always look for the dual and be taught that they cannot understand one side of the coin without unnderstanding the other. (eg. Heyting algebras as logics of constructive proofs, and co-heyting algebras as logics of refutations - then there are things like bi-Heyting algebras, but I am not that far :-) )</p>",

This dependence on the state S is very similar to the indexicality in modalities.</p>",
