A bit more nuanced characterization is that science is a dialectic of model building--prediction generation--experimental testing (which then feeds back to the model). Quasi-fixed points of this feedback loop are often called theories in science. Mathematics is used throughout the process as a language mediating this dialectic mostly because it imposes some sort of internal logical coherence.</p>",
