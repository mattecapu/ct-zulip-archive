Even assuming there are only noninvertible morphisms from an original piece of artwork to its copies (even when the copies are perfect clones of the original), what of the morphisms between the copies?  Art Book A and Art Book B both contain depictions of famous painting X.  There is some sense of \"sameness\" between the two depictions of X.</p>\n<p>Or consider two unused postage stamps of the same design, and even from the same location on the plate—if stamps are still printed that way—so they even have the same (lack of) defects.  Are artists so different from us that they would claim the two stamps are distinguishable as works of art?  (Obviously the post office would consider any two stamps to be isomorphic, even with different designs, so long as the denominations are the same.)</p>",
