A computer is a mechanism that was <em>made</em> in order to compute by people. Even if it doesn't compute correctly it is still a computer, just a defunct computer. </p>\n<p>Interesting to hear your opinion, but we should probably open another topic :)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think \"what is a computer\" is a different question (albeit an interesting one in its own right!) from the one I originally asked. Intent is not very compelling to me as an account of physical implementation of abstract computations. For instance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If I try to write code to test prime-checking, but due to a bug the code always returns true, is the computer actually realizing a prime-checking Turing machine?</li>\n<li>When I perform long division by hand---or, better, in my head---do I realize a dividing Turing machine?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think the right account, whatever it is, should answer no to the first question and yes to the second. Your definition certainly answers yes to the first question; I think we could argue about what it answers for the second. So I think it doesn't really do what we want in paradigmatic examples.</p>",

(You have to be a little careful to specify what you mean by a \"time step\" of the physical system which corresponds to one step of the machine, but this is all worked out by Putnam.) If the physical system is finite, you will never be able to do this for more than a bounded number of steps.

I think most of the accounts in the literature work essentially the same way if you substitute a model of classical computation with a model of quantum computation. This is something we would probably have to treat on a case-by-case basis---i.e. if there's some account of implementation that we think might be affected by the shift from classical to quantum computation, we would have to look at that individually.

The goal of this vein of cognitive philosophy to try to figure out what it is for something to have a mind (or maybe to be conscious, etc). The classical answer is behavioral---to have a mind is to exhibit a certain set of behaviors---but there are a number of problems with this, e.g. p-zombies, etc. So one alternative is to say that a mind is a physical system which implements an abstract computation with certain properties. This is not a behavioral theory, because there are distinct computations with the same external behavior. It also is related to, but distinct from, the actual computational structure of the brain. Under any of the standard accounts of computation in the literature, I strongly suspect that physical analog computers will indeed implement certain abstract combinatorial computations.

Classically, they work with \"input-output automata.\" which at each step take some input from a fixed alphabet, then transition on their state graph, then give some output from a fixed alphabet. Then maybe we can find a mapping from the states of a (non-closed) physical system to the states of the automaton that respects state transitions and input-output dependencies, in which case maybe we could say that (by quotienting together physical states which correspond to the same abstract state) is somehow \"implementing\" that automaton. (I think it's reasonable to avoid the word \"computation\" here.) But as you say, you're very likely to be able to do this for any small automaton because there are so many particles wiggling basically at random in physical systems. So people usually ask that the mapping respects more then just transitions.</p>",

E.g. we treat <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_cell_(computing)\">memory cells</a> as being 'on' if some voltage is higher than a certain amount, and 'off' if it's lower than some other amount - and we carefully set things up so that the precise value of the voltage is irrelevant: only whether it's 'on' or 'off' is relevant.   </p>\n<p>This is what makes a digital computer more easy to understand than a bacterium.   But this is also connected to why, if you throw a digital computer into the jungle, it's less likely to survive.   It's even true for an analogue computer.   Many details of the atoms of its metal parts don't matter much when these parts are working properly - we can consider them 'irrelevant' to the computing it does - but the rain will rust the metal and the computer doesn't have a self-repair process that can fight against this rust.</p>",

This satisfies both of our requirements.</p>\n<p>If you think there's no problem with the above, then you're a \"pancomputationalist\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The strongest version of pancomputationalism is that every physical system performs <em>every</em> computation—or at least, every sufficiently complex system implements a very large number of non-equivalent computations (Putnam 1988, Searle 1992). This may be called <em>unlimited pancomputationalism</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I hope I represented the problem fairly. The question at issue here isn't really about computation. I understand it as closer to something like \"how is it possible to not be confused by this huge bunch of silly maps? There is <em>some</em> set of distinguished mappings right?\" Or maybe you don't like mappings and think they're confusing the issue somehow, etc.</p>\n<p>When I first thought about this, I worried understanding these issues too much would be sort of like making myself go blind by learning how to control each of my eyes independently. So I decided to put this stuff down until I was more comfortable with categorical math.</p>\n<p>But, being aware of the above, does give me a modicum of anxiety when I'm trying to decide how some physical thingy corresponds to some mathematical thingy.</p>",

More precisely, in its original formulation, it states the equivalence between the informal notion of \"effectively computable function\" and the formal model of a Turing machine.</p>\n<p>There have been variants of the thesis that extend its original scope.

As far as I remember, every attempt involved \"crazy\" assumptions, e.g., travel back in time. Of course, the fact that no one managed to imagine a physical mechanism, in our current understanding of our universe, that can solve the Halting problem, doesn't prove the physical Church-Turing thesis.</p>\n<p>Scott Aaronson went further down that road by asking <a href=\"https://www.scottaaronson.com/papers/npcomplete.pdf\">Can NP-complete problems be solved efficiently in the physical universe?</a>.</p>",

Putnam did this in 1960; the definition is roughly that you should have a map from states of the turing machine to states of the physical system that respects state transitions during that bounded period. (You have to be a little careful to specify what you mean by a \"time step\" of the physical system which corresponds to one step of the machine, but this is all worked out by Putnam.) If the physical system is finite, you will never be able to do this for more than a bounded number of steps. But you can definitely write down the definition; it just happens to have philosophical properties that we don't like, basically because these maps are too plentiful to give a meaningful notion of computation.

Thank you for sharing that article, which I haven't seen before and looks really interesting. I read section 6 (will definitely read the rest later). I guess I should say that these issues have also been extensively considered by philosophers and cognitive scientists, e.g. <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-010-9847-7\">here</a>, where the authors argue that only tractable computations can possibly form a basis for a theory of mind. The bibliography there is fairly extensive.</p>\n<p>That said, I'm not convinced that complexity bounds alone can get us out of computational trivialism. In particular, the waterfall argument as Aarsonson articulates it is merely about input-output dependencies, but there are other versions (e.g. the <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00413692\">\"clock-and-dial\" construction of Chalmers</a>) which show that any DFA embeds into any sufficiently complex system with enough states, which is a much stronger result. It's unclear to me what complexity theory has to say about this absent some way to distinguish between \"relevant\" and \"irrelevant\" states (for instance via an encoding of states into binary which has some particular information-theoretic properties, so that distinguishing between irrelevant states is computationally intractable), as we discussed above. So I think we still need some kind of extra structure, causal or semantic or etc.</p>\n<p>But maybe complexity theory does say something about this kind of mapping that I don't see right now? I'm sure Aaronson knows this stuff a million times better than I do, lol.</p>",
