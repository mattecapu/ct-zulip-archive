I'm still convinced that nonviolence is the most potent weapon available to oppressed people in their struggle for freedom and justice. I feel that violence will only create more social problems than they will solve. That in a real sense it is impracticable for the Negro to even think of mounting a violent revolution in the United States. So I will continue to condemn riots, and continue to say to my brothers and sisters that this is not the way. And continue to affirm that there is another way.</p>\n<p>But at the same time, it is as necessary for me to be as vigorous in condemning the conditions which cause persons to feel that they must engage in riotous activities as it is for me to condemn riots. I think America must see that riots do not develop out of thin air. Certain conditions continue to exist in our society which must be condemned as vigorously as we condemn riots. But in the final analysis, a riot is the language of the unheard.\"</p>",

This is not the issue for intellectual jousting, it is for finding as much common ground with as many as possible. My position is I'm non-violent, but that doesn't imply Jain non-violence. I've broken up hundreds of fights with either zero or the minimal about of physical force needed. <br>\nFYI - my spiritual name is Prashanta which mean \"dynamic peace\".  My last job in a school had a 250 lb student repeatedly hitting a blind 70 lb student with running charges. I wasn't allowed to touch the violent student under ANY circumstance, but no one could stop me from being a body shield.  <br>\nI just watched a video here about racial equality and \"white privilege\".  Working out your stance on non-violence from the comfort of your computer keyboard is a white privilege. The real world tends to get grungy real quick.</p>",
