Since any well-trained set-theoretic realist knows they cannot naively take arbitrary collections of things to be sets in a consistent way, the fact of which collections constitute sets is a contingent one; the first sentence in the quote cannot be mistaken to mean that the existence of the members of a collection is always <em>sufficient</em> for that collection to constitute a set. So Menzel is claiming that any realist must make a <strong>choice</strong> as to which constructions they believe produce real sets.</p>\n<p>Menzel presents this as the \"realist's impasse\", essentially observing that any such choice is arbitrary (conveniently ignoring the finitist's choice, for example). In contrasting it with the argument of collections, he essentially observes that God would have the same problem, but claims that's okay because God can make a choice greater than any we could conceive of, and so any extension we lowly mortals reach will <em>de re</em> be realised.</p>\n<p>But in the practice of using ZF (and extensions thereof), a set-theoretic realist is using the axiomatic framework to determine collections which they can be confident form sets based on their confidence in the individual constructions in the framework. In Menzel's own exposition, these are the constructions producing \"safe\" pluralities, and so to which we can assign the label \"set\" without problems. A set-theoretic realist never commits to saying that the smallest initial segment of the hierarchy closed under their chosen safe constructions (if indeed one believes the hierarchy to be ordered enough for there to <em>be</em> a smallest such) constitutes the entirety of the collection of sets.</p>\n<p>Linnebo's modality can reasonably be interpreted purely formally by the realist, not as regarding what is possible regarding the reality of sets, but as what is possible regarding how ZF may be extended to <em>capture</em> that reality, so that the existence of sets is no longer contingent on the modality. Based on the quote that Menzel provides, I believe this is what Linnebo intended.</p>",
