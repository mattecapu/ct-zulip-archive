        "content": "<p>Some philosophers ask questions such as: What is philosophy? What is a human being?  What is a thing? What is life? If a question expresses a hole in understanding, then filling the hole leaves a whole. \"Biological Circularchy\" is supposed to be an adjustable formal framework with enough expressive power to articulate biological theory about Earthly Life in the sense of multi-scale biological autonomy constrained by thermodynamics. It is a never-ending project, and the following link is a \"table of contents\" for the first interim report. This is not a secret. </p>\n<p>Category-theoretic keywords: commutative diagram, bundle, dependent products, sub-object classifiers, nilsquare infinitesimal, monoidal category, \"arrows-only\" category. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cognocity.org/circularchy/2021-CONTENTS-ZD.pdf\">http://www.cognocity.org/circularchy/2021-CONTENTS-ZD.pdf</a></p>",
