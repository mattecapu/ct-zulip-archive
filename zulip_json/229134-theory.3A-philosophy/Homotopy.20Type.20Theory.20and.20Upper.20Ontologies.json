So for example, for the migratory patterns of birds, the functioning of an economy, or whatever, one is inevitably dissecting the phenomenon into metaphysical categories such as \"entities\", \"states\", \"attributes\", \"types\", \"processes\", etc. The range of possibilities and questions for how to think about reality itself has lately been called \"meta-metaphysics\", but in the setting of formal ontologies, is called \"upper ontologies\".</p>\n<p>As of late, I am struggling to choose a default or preferred upper ontology, to do some formal modeling in. Here is a passage which gives me hope that other people are working on this:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/lwv_b8wyN9RmC82lQuyBZTMa/5EA3B9D1-86F4-423C-A2FD-4BFA90D3ECC9.jpg\">mhtt.jpg</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/lwv_b8wyN9RmC82lQuyBZTMa/5EA3B9D1-86F4-423C-A2FD-4BFA90D3ECC9.jpg\" title=\"mhtt.jpg\"><img data-original-dimensions=\"1179x355\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/21317/lwv_b8wyN9RmC82lQuyBZTMa/5EA3B9D1-86F4-423C-A2FD-4BFA90D3ECC9.jpg/840x560.webp\"></a></div><p>I would like to know if people have anything to say about if homotopy type theory / modal homotopy type theory is particularly well-suited for certain upper ontologies, and why.</p>",

        "content": "<p>Thanks for the praise! </p>\n<p>I think there are some interesting things to think about with regard to ontology. As you'll have seen, amongst the dependent type theory for natural language community, there's a division between those who want types for each common noun and those who want to carve out subtypes from a master type 'Entity':<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/_JX-AegZH86GuScoQanW3qA_/image.png\">image.png</a><br>\nBut even that latter group seem to want to allow a range of basic types:<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/eTkgCJgmaxUxxpUudbSrTeiU/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/_JX-AegZH86GuScoQanW3qA_/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img data-original-dimensions=\"496x72\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/21317/_JX-AegZH86GuScoQanW3qA_/image.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/eTkgCJgmaxUxxpUudbSrTeiU/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img data-original-dimensions=\"469x96\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/21317/eTkgCJgmaxUxxpUudbSrTeiU/image.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div><p>Of course, there's plenty of work not using dependent type theory which looks to determine the fundamental ontological categories, for instance, the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01597\">DOLCE</a> program. There's perhaps some useful work to be done starting from their taxonomy, but using dependent types rather than first-order logic:<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/zUpG-IZiW6ijZ41F_1YNc4Be/image.png\">image.png</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/zUpG-IZiW6ijZ41F_1YNc4Be/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img data-original-dimensions=\"812x375\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/21317/zUpG-IZiW6ijZ41F_1YNc4Be/image.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div>",
