To ask someone to have such deep knowledge of the humanities, psychology and brain sciences and also Category Theory at this stage would at this point in history still be to ask a lot.  I guess he would be fascinated by the Yoneda lemma and work by Maruyama if he were pointed to it, and helped to get his head around it.  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bblfish/status/1466543393178206209\">https://twitter.com/bblfish/status/1466543393178206209</a></p>\n<div class=\"inline-preview-twitter\"><div class=\"twitter-tweet\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bblfish/status/1466543393178206209\"><img class=\"twitter-avatar\" src=\"https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/77b199c7e82b7b9c52e9d03926bbf1970d09fe5d/68747470733a2f2f7062732e7477696d672e636f6d2f70726f66696c655f696d616765732f313030343332363736313630383431373238312f486a786a533942585f6e6f726d616c2e6a7067\"></a><p>I think the only part that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dr_mcgilchrist\">@dr_mcgilchrist</a>\ndoes not look at in the talk \"The Coincidence of Opposites\" is Mathematics.
