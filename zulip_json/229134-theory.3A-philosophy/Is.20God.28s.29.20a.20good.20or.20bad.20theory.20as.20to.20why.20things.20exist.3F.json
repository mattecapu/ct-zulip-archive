Physicists have a bunch of fascinating theories about this.  For example, Ashtekar argues that loop quantum gravity predicts that the concept of linearly ordered time breaks down near the Big Bang, but that you can approximately think of our universe as having a time-reversed Big Crunch before the Big Bang.   He calls this theory the Big Bounce:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Abhay Ashtekar, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.5491\">The Big Bang and the quantum</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This short review is addressed to cosmologists.  General relativity predicts that space-time comes to an end and physics comes to a halt at the big-bang. Recent developments in loop quantum cosmology have shown that these predictions cannot be trusted. Quantum geometry effects can resolve singularities, thereby opening new vistas. Examples are: The big bang is replaced by a quantum bounce; the 'horizon problem' disappears; immediately after the big bounce, there is a super-inflationary phase with its own phenomenological ramifications; and, in presence of a standard inflaton potential, initial conditions are naturally set for a long, slow roll inflation independently of what happens in the pre-big bang branch.</p>\n</blockquote>",

(Ashtekhar is trying to provide such predictions.)   One way to test such predictions would be to study the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave_background\">gravitational background radiation</a> left over from very earlier times, much earlier than the microwave background radiation, since gravitational waves must have decoupled from matter long before <a href=\"https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/timeline.html#bang\">380,000 years after the Big Bang</a>.   The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_Interferometer_Space_Antenna\">LISA satellites</a> will try to measure the gravitational background radiation sometime in the 2030s.</p>\n<p>This will be vastly more exciting to me than anything anyone says about extra-cosmic creators.  There's just more solid stuff for me to sink my teeth into: I can think about the experimental challenges of launching 3 satellites into space to detect low-frequency gravitational waves, the theory of how gravitational waves interact with the extremely dense matter at very early times, the various theories of quantum gravity and how people have used them to guess what happened 'before the Big Bang'  or how the ordinary concept of time breaks down under extreme conditions, etc. etc. etc.</p>",

        "content": "<p>One response, that only occurs to me because of things I have learned over the past year, is:</p>\n<p>The question puts forward a particular conceptual model - “Gods”, “universe”, “causation”, “existence”, and presumably assumes the relevance of related categories like “time”, “space”, etc.</p>\n<p>It then asks for the resolution of a certain question “over that conceptual model”. If the conceptual model is sufficiently precisely defined, that question may be very answerable. You can think of it as a provable conjecture in a logical system, or maybe as a query over a data model.</p>\n<p>Maybe things like Gödel’s ontological proof fall prey to this same mistake, which is that for a given conceptual model someone is using (either explicitly defined or implicitly assumed), it might be easy to make complete, even formal logical argument for what kinds of conclusions can be drawn from the premises of that model.</p>\n<p>The fallacy is that we may have no justification for why that conceptual model is relevant to “the thing around us” (existence, the universe, etc.) So long as we make use of even basic assumptions like the existence of “time”, “the universe”, etc., and certain minimal properties they have, we are distracting (rhetorically speaking) ourselves by resolving logical propositions about a conceptual model we built in our minds, when we have no way of knowing if the assumptions built into those categories we are using, like “time”, are accurate descriptors of “the thing we actually want to describe” (the world around us, etc.)</p>\n<p>This is what I think about when I hear things like “quantum gravity may imply that time did not exist before the Big Bang”: if we try to work out a logically perfect answer to questions like “does there have to be a “first mover”? How could something come from nothing?””, even if our logic within a chosen ontology is impeccable, we may be blinded by how the ontology we are using has nothing to do with “the thing around us” (the world).</p>",
