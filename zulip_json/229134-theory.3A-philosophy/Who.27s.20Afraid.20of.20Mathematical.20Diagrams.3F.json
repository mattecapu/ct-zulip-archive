Here's the abstract: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mathematical diagrams are frequently used in contemporary mathematics. They are, however, widely seen as not contributing to the justificatory force of proofs: they are considered to be either mere illustrations or shorthand for non-diagrammatic expressions.   Moreover, when they are used inferentially, they are seen as threatening the reliability of proofs.  In this paper, I examine certain examples of diagrams that resist this type of dismissive characterization. By presenting two diagrammatic proofs, one from topology and one from algebra, I show that diagrams form genuine notational systems, and I argue that this explains why they can play a role in the inferential structure of proofs without undermining their reliability.  I then consider whether diagrams can be essential to the proofs in which they appear.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In particular, what do you all think of the idea that diagrams are mere shorthand for more cumbersome non-diagrammatic expressions? Personally, I doubt whether the distinction between the diagrammatic and non-diagrammatic really makes sense!</p>",

We don’t think a lot about this step of recognizing the symbols. It shows that mathematics written by hand can’t be 100% formal because there is this informal step. This is more of a theoretical argument than a practical one. In practice, this is rarely an issue because we have been trained in writing and reading and today we use typesetting which writes symbols clearly for us. </p>\n<p>I recognize that with string diagrams the issue comes back but still in practice, we seem to succeed in communicating effectively with string diagrams.</p>\n<p>The good thing with diagrams, and here I think I just repeat something written in the book « Picturing Quantum Processes » is that instead of encoding mathematics in our human language using the alphabet plus other symbols, it is a way of taking advantage of our physical world in which we can depict path and other patterns. When I see a string diagram, I think about rivers, electrical circuits, deliveries of goods etc… and it can help in proving stuff. </p>\n<p>In this sense, diagrams are not a shorthands for non-diagrammatic expressions! They are another language, often more effective but not all the time. When manipulating huge expressions in monoidal categories, the compactness of usual equations can make them more practical to use than string diagrams (here I’m thinking about concrete experience proving the Faà di Bruno rule in a differential category for instance).</p>\n<p>Sometimes sequent calculus is better than both diagrams and usual equations, or lambda calculuses are better etc… To each mathematical practice (and here I include computer science as a mathematical practice), its best language. It’s all a matter of convenience and it can even depends on your mood. There is no best programming language, just some more practical than others in some situation. The same can be said of mathematical languages/notations.</p>",
