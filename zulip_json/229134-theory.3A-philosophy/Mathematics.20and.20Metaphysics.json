There, math informs physics by allowing us to construct mathematical models of physical systems we can make empirical predictions from, and physics informs math by inspiring new mathematical definitions and axioms. For instance, Euclid's axioms were inspired by his observations of the world, and more recently there's been many new fields of interest opening in higher geometry inspired by string theory.</p>",

For instance, a metaphysical theory about how the world is composed (a theory of compositionality) might lead one to adopting a certain set of set theoretic axioms that most correlate with that worldview.</p>",
