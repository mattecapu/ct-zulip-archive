I have written a paper relating the Yoneda Lemma to the structure of Existence and Being within the Western worldview. Audacious I know. Anyway I thought someone here might be interested in the <em>attempt</em> to apply a central concept in Category Theory to Western philosophy in a significant way. Whether successful or not <em>it is an attempt</em> to place Category Theory at the center of things, as organizing the worldview, even if that is hard to believe. See <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/115745588/Existence_Mathematics_Being\">https://www.academia.edu/115745588/Existence_Mathematics_Being</a> Let me know what I got wrong. As a speculative philosopher leaping to conclusions I am happy to find I am wrong and get corrected especially about the niceties of Category Theory which I am still trying to learn.</p>",
