In particular, I am interested in using categorical ideas to model informal modes of reasoning and argumentation. For example, argument by analogy or inference to the best explanation. I also think category theory could be used to model hermeneutic relationship between texts.  For example, modelling how a text can be about another text or about a text that is about a text and so on. </p>\n<p>I have found a few articles on modelling analogies with functors and/or natural transformations. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.10542\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.10542</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://psyarxiv.com/zp3jq/download\">https://psyarxiv.com/zp3jq/download</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://psyarxiv.com/zp3jq/download\">https://psyarxiv.com/zp3jq/download</a></p>\n<p>I would be grateful for any pointers towards other discussion of these topics.</p>",

Kind of like the Adobe Photoshop of reasoning. I feel that we should have tools for informal thought that are an improvement over a chalkboard. So far, this has been elusive. The idea is not to add another layer of meta-data as annotations on natural language thoughts, but instead to use a CT powered tool as a direct medium for expressing ideas and arguments.</p>",

        "content": "<p>I have run into a similar problem with oLogs. I was super excited when I first came across them, but then using them proved difficult. It is possible that something like oLogs could work as a kind of low-level language, with some good user-interface and abstraction layer over top of them to allow the expression of complex things. Just to take a simple example. With ologs if you want to talk about a subset you need to start constructing pullbacks from sub-object classifiers. This should not be something the user has to deal with. They should just be able to specify that it's a subset. Figuring out what interface  abstractions are useful for actual reasoning in informal domains is the big challenge.</p>",
