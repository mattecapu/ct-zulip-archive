I find this especially irksome in the case of Peirce  since I have felt from the beginning Peirce more than any other thinker gave us the framework and the tools we need to integrate the two-culture divide in society at large.</p>",

In fact now that you mention it, Deleuze did talk about diagrams (eg. searching, I just found this <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/deleuze-and-the-diagram-9781441115607/\">Deleuze and the Diagram</a>) and gave them a central role. At the time when I listened to a few of his lectures,  I knew too little about Category Theory, especially about diagrams, to know if there was a formal/serious relation, or if these words were just accidentally the same.  But this book is certainly making the case for it being serious, and indeed that would also have been my guess for the simple reason that Mathematics in France has nearly a religious standing, so that it is hardly possible for a great philosopher to not be listening carefully to the breakthroughs happening in mathematics.</p>\n<p>So that then makes me wonder if Deleuze's book on <a href=\"https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/the-fold\">Folds</a> could have been inspired by catamorphisms.... (I guess I should read some of them to find out).</p>",

Spinoza, Peirce and Deleuze are, in different ways, philosophers of immanence.

He integrates insights from Spinozist metaphysics, Peircean semiotics and Deleuze's philosophy of difference in conjunction with the formal operations of category theory.
