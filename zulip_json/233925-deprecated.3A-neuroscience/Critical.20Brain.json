Yes, I have closely been following Erhesmann and Gomez-Ramirez (his book was good too <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-94-007-7738-5\">https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-94-007-7738-5</a>) As you said they have been trying for very very long. <br>\nBut, Critical brain hypothesis hasn't been discussed in their work. This is more Physics-y recent paper <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04353\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04353</a> but no one applied CT in this approach. That is what I was thinking vaguely about, starting with a Markov or generalized Markov process.</p>",

I meant groups of people in real life  (thinking about potential grad school places) and also so that I have some one to correspond with since no one around me is working on this right now, I am trying independently.</p>",
