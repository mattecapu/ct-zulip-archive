        "content": "<p>Andreas Blaas: <strong>A topos view of axioms of choice for finite sets</strong></p>\n<p>Tarski proved (in set theory without choice) that if one assumes that all families of 2-element sets have choice functions then one can prove that all families of 4-element sets have choice functions. Mostowski (1937) investigated similar implications, giving number-theoretic and group-theoretic conditions, some necessary and some sufficient for such implications. But some questions remained unsolved, in particular: Do choice from 3-element sets, from 5-element sets, and from 13-element sets together imply choice from 15-element sets. Gauntt (1970) resolved those remaining questions, using group-theoretic criteria. I plan to describe some of this work and to explain what it has to do with topos theory.</p>",
