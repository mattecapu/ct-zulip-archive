Both types of spaces become instances of small so-called (T,V)-categories, where T is a Set-monad and V a (commutative) quantale, i.e. a small, thin and (symmetric) monoidal-closed category. The setting therefore allows for a general study of „spaces“ that combines geometric and numerical aspects in a natural way.</p>\n<p>In this talk we present some key elements of the theory and its applications, showing in particular how the strictification and inversion of some naturally occurring inequalities in this lax-monoidal setting leads to interesting topological properties and unexpected connections. Time permitting, we will also point to some on-going and future work in the area.</p>\n<p>YouTube: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/3Ollbf-jOdY\">https://youtu.be/3Ollbf-jOdY</a><br>\nZoom: <a href=\"https://topos-institute.zoom.us/j/5344862882?pwd=Znh3UlUrek41T3RLQXJVRVNkM3Ewdz09\">https://topos-institute.zoom.us/j/5344862882?pwd=Znh3UlUrek41T3RLQXJVRVNkM3Ewdz09</a></p>\n<div class=\"youtube-video message_inline_image\"><a data-id=\"3Ollbf-jOdY\" href=\"https://youtu.be/3Ollbf-jOdY\"><img src=\"https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/fcf77ffa9002ffe285852306432ea76f885ab5b7/68747470733a2f2f692e7974696d672e636f6d2f76692f334f6c6c62662d6a4f64592f64656661756c742e6a7067\"></a></div>",
