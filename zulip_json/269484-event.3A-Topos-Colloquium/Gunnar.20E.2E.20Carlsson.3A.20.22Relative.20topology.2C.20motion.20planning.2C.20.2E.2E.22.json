Although these invariants are in general quite rich, they are somewhat sparse in low dimensions. On the other hand, it is possible to consider comma categories of spaces, for example the category of spaces with reference to a fixed base space and morphisms respecting the reference map. When one does this, one obtains a much richer set of invariants. I will discuss how to apply this kind of construction in the setting of evasion problems for sensor nets and more general motion planning problems.</p>",
