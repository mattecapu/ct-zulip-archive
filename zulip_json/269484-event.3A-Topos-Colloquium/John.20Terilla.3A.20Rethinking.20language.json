Without it, no aspect of modern life could exist. But what is language exactly? How precisely does meaning emerge from sequences constructed from a small collection of basic symbols or sounds? Biologists, linguists, and philosophers have been debating this question---still unanswered---for thousands of years. </p>\n<p>Now, at a pivotal moment when intelligent machines are beginning to acquire human language skills, new insights into the nature of language are emerging. Some old beliefs about language can probably be cast aside and achievements in artificial intelligence are inspiring some new ways of thinking of language.</p>\n<p>I will present an argument for rethinking language and give a tour of some relevant mathematical ideas. The talk will be prepared keeping in mind the four themes of the Topos Institute Colloquium: ethics and societal impact of mathematics, applied category theory, foundation models, and technology and tools.</p>\n<p>Zoom: <a href=\"https://topos-institute.zoom.us/j/84392523736?pwd=bjdVS09wZXVscjQ0QUhTdGhvZ3pUdz09\">https://topos-institute.zoom.us/j/84392523736?pwd=bjdVS09wZXVscjQ0QUhTdGhvZ3pUdz09</a><br>\nYouTube: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-xm7qbPOFYI\">https://youtu.be/-xm7qbPOFYI</a></p>\n<div class=\"youtube-video message_inline_image\"><a data-id=\"-xm7qbPOFYI\" href=\"https://youtu.be/-xm7qbPOFYI\"><img src=\"https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/d289fcc33ecae3e633089875510fafb787d7efa9/68747470733a2f2f692e7974696d672e636f6d2f76692f2d786d377162504f4659492f64656661756c742e6a7067\"></a></div>",
