An infinity modular operad is such a network where operations can be continuously varied with respect to time. The goal of this talk is to give a gentle introduction to a Segal model for infinity modular operads, focusing on the topological origins of the idea. The audience is not expected to be familiar with operads or topology. This talk will cover snippets of joint work with Luci Bonatto, Pedro Boavida, Philip Hackney , Geoffroy Horel and Donald Yau.</p>",
