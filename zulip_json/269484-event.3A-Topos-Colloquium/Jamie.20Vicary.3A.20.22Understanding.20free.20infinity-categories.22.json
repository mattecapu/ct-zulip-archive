In this talk I will present a new definition of free infinity-category that demystifies them, and makes them easy to understand from an algebraic perspective. The definition is given as a sequence of inductive-recursive data structures, and we explore how this relates to Grothendieck's original ideas on infinity-categories. No knowledge of infinity-categories is required to follow this talk!</p>\n<p>This is joint work with Christopher Dean, Eric Finster, Ioannis Markakis and David Reutter.</p>",
