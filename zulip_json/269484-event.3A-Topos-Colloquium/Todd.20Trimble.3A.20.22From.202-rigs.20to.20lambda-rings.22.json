A common theme in this area is the notion of 'plethory'. We sketch how the archetypal plethory of lambda rings arises simply and naturally from the simplest possible '2-plethory', and applying decategorification to it.</p>\n<p>YouTube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmtUi2eiNdI\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmtUi2eiNdI</a><br>\nZoom: <a href=\"https://topos-institute.zoom.us/j/5344862882\">https://topos-institute.zoom.us/j/5344862882</a></p>\n<div class=\"youtube-video message_inline_image\"><a data-id=\"VmtUi2eiNdI\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmtUi2eiNdI\"><img src=\"https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/3a3bbfa6925b372a154a9989f246b3d2794ea13d/68747470733a2f2f692e7974696d672e636f6d2f76692f566d7455693265694e64492f64656661756c742e6a7067\"></a></div>",
