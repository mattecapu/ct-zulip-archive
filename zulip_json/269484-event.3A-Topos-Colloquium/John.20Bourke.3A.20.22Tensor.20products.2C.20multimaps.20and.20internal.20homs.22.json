Considering the relationship between them leads naturally to skew variants - skew monoidal categories, skew multicategories and skew closed categories - and I will explore some of these variants in this talk.</p>\n<p>Zoom: <a href=\"https://topos-institute.zoom.us/j/5344862882?pwd=Znh3UlUrek41T3RLQXJVRVNkM3Ewdz09\">https://topos-institute.zoom.us/j/5344862882?pwd=Znh3UlUrek41T3RLQXJVRVNkM3Ewdz09</a><br>\nYouTube: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/89oFVIVXMYg\">https://youtu.be/89oFVIVXMYg</a></p>\n<div class=\"youtube-video message_inline_image\"><a data-id=\"89oFVIVXMYg\" href=\"https://youtu.be/89oFVIVXMYg\"><img src=\"https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/a00f68039c8cbc8d77b045f2f8ff6bbbfe369d1c/68747470733a2f2f692e7974696d672e636f6d2f76692f38396f46564956584d59672f64656661756c742e6a7067\"></a></div>",

You can find all the papers (and Agda code!) on <a href=\"https://niccoloveltri.github.io/\">Niccolò's website</a>.  If you're interested, the best place to start might be the paper <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05213\">the sequent calculus of skew monoidal categories</a>.</p>",
