After a general introduction to categorical probability in terms of Markov categories, I will explain how to formulate a form of the strong law of large numbers within this framework, namely the Glivenko-Cantelli theorem on the convergence of the empirical distribution. I will also sketch how to use this statement in order to derive other laws of large numbers from it.</em></p>\n<p>Zoom: <a href=\"https://topos-institute.zoom.us/j/5344862882?pwd=Znh3UlUrek41T3RLQXJVRVNkM3Ewdz09\">https://topos-institute.zoom.us/j/5344862882?pwd=Znh3UlUrek41T3RLQXJVRVNkM3Ewdz09</a><br>\nYouTube: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Gvf3H4e7l8s\">https://youtu.be/Gvf3H4e7l8s</a></p>\n<div class=\"youtube-video message_inline_image\"><a data-id=\"Gvf3H4e7l8s\" href=\"https://youtu.be/Gvf3H4e7l8s\"><img src=\"https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/f4e624f9449e7a915c09be54607eac37fe36cd9e/68747470733a2f2f692e7974696d672e636f6d2f76692f47766633483465376c38732f64656661756c742e6a7067\"></a></div>",
