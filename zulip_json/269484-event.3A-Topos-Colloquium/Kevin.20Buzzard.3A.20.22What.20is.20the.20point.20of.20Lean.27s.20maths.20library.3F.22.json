Over the last four years I have been part of a team of mathematicians and computer scientists who have got it into their heads that it is somehow \"obviously\" a good idea to build a formally verified library of modern mathematics in Lean. You can think of it as a 21st century Bourbaki if you like, although our plans are actually far grander than Bourbaki's. I will talk about two things: (1) how it's going and (2) why we're doing it. No background in computer proof checkers will be necessary to follow the talk.</p>\n<p>Zoom: <a href=\"https://topos-institute.zoom.us/j/5344862882?pwd=Znh3UlUrek41T3RLQXJVRVNkM3Ewdz09\">https://topos-institute.zoom.us/j/5344862882?pwd=Znh3UlUrek41T3RLQXJVRVNkM3Ewdz09</a><br>\nYouTube: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/alByz_LoANE\">https://youtu.be/alByz_LoANE</a></p>\n<div class=\"youtube-video message_inline_image\"><a data-id=\"alByz_LoANE\" href=\"https://youtu.be/alByz_LoANE\"><img src=\"https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/4294d21ccc6b95be32d0667e2cb20ee46f96693e/68747470733a2f2f692e7974696d672e636f6d2f76692f616c42797a5f4c6f414e452f64656661756c742e6a7067\"></a></div>",
