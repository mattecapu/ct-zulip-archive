From the interpretation of identities between terms as paths in an abstract space, to the univalence principle identifying identities of types with homotopy equivalences of spaces, the standard tools of abstract homotopy theory provide the means to make rigorous the basic intuition behind the homotopical interpretation of the formal logical system.  <br>\nSo good is this kind of model that it turns out to be possible to invert the process, in a certain sense; given a categorical model of HoTT of an appropriate kind, one can construct from it a full Quillen model structure on the underlying category.  This can be seen as a further strengthening of the idea of HoTT as the internal language of an <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">∞</span></span></span></span>-topos.</p>\n<p>YouTube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0Fwhum4X08\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0Fwhum4X08</a><br>\nZoom: <a href=\"https://topos-institute.zoom.us/j/5344862882?pwd=Znh3UlUrek41T3RLQXJVRVNkM3Ewdz09\">https://topos-institute.zoom.us/j/5344862882?pwd=Znh3UlUrek41T3RLQXJVRVNkM3Ewdz09</a></p>\n<div class=\"youtube-video message_inline_image\"><a data-id=\"c0Fwhum4X08\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0Fwhum4X08\"><img src=\"https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/e6dab447e8b5df21b7926a98ff2d26cf972dcc4e/68747470733a2f2f692e7974696d672e636f6d2f76692f6330467768756d345830382f64656661756c742e6a7067\"></a></div>",
