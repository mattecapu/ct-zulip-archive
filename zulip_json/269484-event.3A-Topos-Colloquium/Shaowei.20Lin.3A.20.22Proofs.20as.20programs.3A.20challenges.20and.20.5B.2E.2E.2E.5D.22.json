        "content": "<p><em>Abstract:</em><br>\nThe Curry-Howard correspondence between proofs and programs suggests that we can exploit proof assistants for writing software. I will discuss the challenges behind a na√Øve execution of this idea, and some preliminary strategies for overcoming them. As an example, we will organize higher-order information in knowledge graphs using dependent type theory, and automate the answering of queries using a proof assistant. In another example, we will explore how decentralized proof assistants can enable mathematicians or programmers to work collaboratively on a theorem or application. If time permits, I will outline connections to canonical structures (ssreflect), reflection (ssreflect), transport, unification and universe management.</p>",

Communities grow by people responding to articles that are already in the community.  The reply has to successfully pass the voting phase.  This means that the reply has to relate to the original post (to which it is replying) by either:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Extending</li>\n<li>Explaining</li>\n<li>Supporting</li>\n<li>\n<p>Refuting<br>\nor</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Critiquing</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>the original post.</p>\n<p>You have to log in to be able to post.  Anyone can reply to any post.</p>\n<p>We are basically in the phase now where we need early adopters.  I hope you have a good experience of the site.</p>",
