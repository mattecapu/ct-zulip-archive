Hanson from the University of Maryland, <a href=\"http://james-hanson.github.io\">james-hanson.github.io</a>.</p>\n<p>In 1874 Georg Cantor published a theorem stating that every sequence of reals is avoided by some real, thereby showing that the reals are not countable. Cantor's proof uses classical logic. There are constructive proofs, although they all rely on the axiom of countable choice. Can the real numbers be shown uncountable without excluded middle and without the axiom of choice? An answer has not been found so far, although not for lack of trying.</p>\n<p>We show that there is a topos in which the real numbers are countable, i.e., there is an epimorphism from the object of natural numbers to the object of Dedekind reals. Therefore, higher-order intuitionistic logic cannot show the reals to be uncountable.</p>\n<p>The starting point of our construction is a sequence of reals, shown to exist by Joseph S. Miller from University of Wisconsin–Madison, with a strong counter-diagonalization property: if an oracle Turing machine computes a specific real number, when given any oracle representing Miller's sequence, then the number appears in the sequence. One gets the idea that the reals ought to be countable in a realizability topos built from Turing machines with oracles for Miller's sequence. However, we cannot just use ordinary realizability, because all realizability toposes validate countable choice and consequently the uncountability of the reals.</p>\n<p>To obtain a topos with countable reals, we define a variant of realizability which we call parameterized realizability. First we define parameterized partial combinatory algebras (ppca), which are partial combinatory algebras whose evaluation depends on a parameter. We then define parameterized realizability toposes. In these realizers witness logical statements uniformly in the parameters. The motivating example is the parameterized realizability topos built from the ppca of oracle Turing machines parameterized by oracles for Miller's sequence. In this topos, Miller's sequence is the desired epimorphism from natural numbers to Dedekind reals.</p>\n<p>Zoom: <a href=\"https://topos-institute.zoom.us/j/84392523736\">https://topos-institute.zoom.us/j/84392523736</a><br>\nYouTube: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/4CBFUojXoq4\">https://youtu.be/4CBFUojXoq4</a></p>\n<div class=\"youtube-video message_inline_image\"><a data-id=\"4CBFUojXoq4\" href=\"https://youtu.be/4CBFUojXoq4\"><img src=\"https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/60f9c7e936e71a16ee921bd3fffb69332929ce62/68747470733a2f2f692e7974696d672e636f6d2f76692f34434246556f6a586f71342f64656661756c742e6a7067\"></a></div>",

But, given that evidenced frames are complete with respect to Set-based triposes (using the older/stronger definition of triposes where all fibred products satisfy Beck-Chevalley, not just simple fibred products), it's almost guaranteed that they cover parameterized realizability toposes. Nonetheless, I think ease of construction is what's more important.</p>\n<p>It's already easy to construct an evidenced frame from a PCA. From what I inferred, a parameterized PCA is an indexed collection of PCAs that share the same carrier set and SKI combinators. This means the evidenced frames resulting from these PCAs share the same interpretation of top and conjunction and the same algebra of evidences; the only things that differ are their interpretation of universal implication and their evidence relations. Furthermore, the interpretations of propositions has an ordering (by set inclusion) with meets that respect the evidence relations, and the semantics of their evidence for introducing universal implication (i.e. creating lambdas) is independent of the parameter (because creating a lambda does not use the oracle - it's a \"pure\" operation). In such a scenario (call it, say, a parameterized evidenced frame), I was able to quickly prove in Coq today that the intersection of these evidence relations is a valid evidence relation for the obvious evidenced frame interpreting universal implication as the meet of the parameterized interpretations of universal implication. That intersected evidence relation is precisely the definition in the talk where a code is evidence of entailment only if it works for reduction with respect to all choices of oracle.</p>\n<p>So the construction seems to be: Tripos-To-Topos(Evidenced-Frame-To-Tripos(Intersect-Parameterized-Evidenced-Frame(oracle =&gt; PCA-To-Evidenced-Frame(PCA-Using-Oracle(oracle)))))</p>\n<p>(Obviously this has nothing to do with the real key insights of this cool talk, but it's nice to see that our broader framework could have offered more helpful flexibility and eliminated some boilerplate.)</p>",

        "content": "<p>That's a good question, and I think it boils down to what a \"unifying framework\" is and what a unifying framework's utility is. Let me try to boil things down with evidenced frames and triposes to tease that apart.</p>\n<p>In this talk, the tripos is constructed by modeling predicates on X as functions from X to some set of propositions, and by modeling that predicate phi implies predicate psi as \"there exists uniform evidences that, for every x, phi(x) entails psi(x)\". That is, entailment on predicates is reduced to uniform pointwise entailment on propositions. This way, when an entailment holds, you can extract the evidence, i.e. realizer, of the entailment.</p>\n<p>We developed evidenced frames to be a smallest structure that enables this \"uniform families\" tripos construction. We did this because in earlier work, like in this talk, we had a model that was clearly computational but which did not form a PCA (in our case it was because it used state, whereas in the talk it's because they use oracles). Like in this talk, this let us build a realizibility model that does not exhibit common properties of PCA-based realizability triposes; for example, we built a model in which weak countable choice fails to hold. We built (and are still building) a bunch of models, and it's way easier to build an evidenced frame than it is to (directly) build a tripos, so they were a huge time saver.</p>\n<p>Originally that was all their purpose was, but we were surprised to realize that, because we had sufficiently abstracted what \"evidence\" was, every tripos could be represented as an evidenced frame. (Technically, we built a biadjoint biequivalence between relevant preordered categories.) In particular, given a tripos, one can define \"evidence\" to be an (external) relation between propositions for which \"uniform\" entailment holds internally (where the definition of \"uniform\" is more than I can go into here, but relies on fibred products satisfying Beck-Chevalley - \"reflected axiom schema\" is the relevant definition in the paper). Now, if one takes an evidenced frame and turns it into a tripos, the reflected axiom schemas of that tripos are precisely the relations between propositions for which there exists uniform evidence of entailment in the evidenced frame. But a key detail is that the evidence only <em>exists</em>, you can't <em>functionally</em> extract it. So the completeness is in a logical sense, but in a functional/constructive sense there's some lossiness in triposes. So, from our perspective, a tripos is an evidenced frame that has \"forgotten\" its evidence.</p>\n<p>Okay, so why is this useful? For one, there's utility in simply eliminating the boilerplate, making it easier to build models by just defining things in propositions and automatically extending to predicates in a uniform manner. For another, there's utility in being broader, since we've seen that there are interesting realizability models that are not constructed directly from PCAs, i.e. are not \"traditional\" realizability triposes. And, as we've seen, you can combine evidenced frames in useful and interesting ways. But, besides building realizability models, it also gives us a framework for asking questions. For example, we can ask what properties do or do not hold for triposes/toposes derived from evidenced frames with Nat (or isomorphic to Nat) evidence. That subset of evidenced frames seems particularly relevant to models related to computation (and I'm sure not all triposes fall within that subset). And at the same time, it makes fairly minimal assumptions that do not impose particular interpretations of what computation is, and as such it accommodates computation with non-determinism, state, exceptions, continuations, and (as we see now) underdetermined oracles. So we can furthermore explore what the implications of giving the algebraic structure on evidence equational properties that further encode assumptions about computational behavior.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure we can combine triposes in the same way we can combine evidenced frames (though the converse might be true to). And I'm pretty sure we can't ask the same questions about triposes that we can ask about evidenced frames (without going through evidenced frames). For example, the triposes derived from evidenced frames with Nat evidence versus those derived from just countable evidence both have a set of reflected axiom schemas that is only countable and not isomorphic to Nat, which suggests that its much harder to reason about what the computational behavior of these reflected axiom schemas might be than it would be in evidenced frames where you have direct access to the evidence. All this is why I suspect evidenced frames are a better unifying framework for realizability models, even if triposes can technically be made into an evidenced frame and a sort of realizability model. That said, it's all new, so we're only just beginning to explore these questions ourselves.</p>",

Evidenced frames have an algebra, so you'd expect a morphism of evidenced frames to be a standard morphism of algebras. If we did that, we get a more proof-relevant notion of morphism, and we still get an adjunction. However, the unit on the evidenced-frame side is not invertible in this notion of morphism due to the lossy nature of triposes discussed above. So, we used a definition of morphism that just focuses on the logical behavior (i.e. does an entailment hold, rather than how) in the paper, and with that definition the inverse of the unit exists.

Here's a possible analogy that occurs to me: every Grothendieck topos can be presented as the category of sheaves on some subcanonical site with finite limits.  In fact it is the category of sheaves for the canonical topology on itself, but we can also make the site small by taking a generating set of objects closed under finite limits.  But in practice, it is often useful to present toposes as sheaves on some site that isn't subcanonical and/or doesn't have finite limits, since such examples arise naturally.  Would you say the trio (Grothendieck topos, subcanonical finitely-complete site, arbitrary site) is at all similar to the trio (triposable topos, tripos, evidenced frame)?</p>",

        "content": "<p>That analogy seems reasonable, though unfortunately I don't have sufficient background to say that with high confidence. I guess I think of the connection as three different perspectives on the same concept: models of (dependent) higher-order logic. Toposes are the categorical perspective (albeit of a particularly strong class of models); triposes are the fibred perspective; and evidenced frames are the realizability perspective. (Note, in all cases, these models have requirements that do not always hold for (even dependent) HOL models, such as the fact that every (external) predicate has a corresponding (internal) predicate is modeled by an external existential quantifier rather than just an internal one.) (Also, we've been focusing on Set-based triposes, but there seems to be a straightforward way to generalize evidenced frames to other base categories with a dash of Set-like structure.)</p>\n<p>I can speak with more confidence on your latter puzzle though. First, we should recognize that are many definitions of tripos that are similar but often differ in details such as size. Nonetheless, I think in all cases there's a good intuition for why they're \"essentially\" small due to our finding. For example, even if you allow a large class of predicates over any given base object X, every such predicate has some corresponding morphism in the base category from X to <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Ω</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\Omega</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">Ω</span></span></span></span>, and similarly given such a morphism there is some corresponding predicate; so the small set of morphisms from X to <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Ω</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\Omega</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">Ω</span></span></span></span> essentially describes all the relevant structure on predicates over X (yes, some predicates might have the same corresponding morphism, but that loss of equality is not observable in the logic, as the logic can only reason about equality wrt its base-category's objects).</p>\n<p>I'm guessing all that wasn't what you're asking about though. Rather, the bigger surprise it that even though a tripos describes a large set of inequalities—for each base object, an inequality on the predicates over that base object—that large set of inequalities can itself be described by a small set, namely a subset of <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"script\">P</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Ω</mi><mo>×</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Ω</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathcal{P}(\\Omega \\times \\Omega)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathcal\" style=\"margin-right:0.08222em;\">P</span><span class=\"mopen\">(</span><span class=\"mord\">Ω</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222em;\"></span><span class=\"mbin\">×</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">Ω</span><span class=\"mclose\">)</span></span></span></span>.

So, for realizability triposes, our notion of reflected axiom schemes precisely corresponds to entailment.

But what we showed is that the proof relies only on the ability to define reflection of external predicates as internal predicates, i.e. <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">∣</mi><mo>∙</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">∣</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">(| \\bullet |)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mopen\">(</span><span class=\"mord\">∣</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222em;\"></span><span class=\"mbin\">∙</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">∣</span><span class=\"mclose\">)</span></span></span></span>, and the behavior of that reflection with respect to constructs such as existential quantifiers and conjunctions. And we showed that, because arbitrary fibred products satisfy Beck-Chevalley, such a predicate reflection can be defined in any Set-based tripos. Thus predicate entailment in all (such) Set-based triposes can be described entirely by reflected axiom schemas; every entailment is essentially a substitution of the entailment <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>ϕ</mi><mo separator=\"true\">,</mo><msup><mi>ϕ</mi><mo mathvariant=\"normal\" lspace=\"0em\" rspace=\"0em\">′</mo></msup><mo>:</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">Ω</mi><mo>∣</mo><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">∣</mi><mi>ϕ</mi><mo>R</mo><msup><mi>ϕ</mi><mo mathvariant=\"normal\" lspace=\"0em\" rspace=\"0em\">′</mo></msup><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">∣</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo><mo separator=\"true\">,</mo><mi>ϕ</mi><mo>⊢</mo><msup><mi>ϕ</mi><mo mathvariant=\"normal\" lspace=\"0em\" rspace=\"0em\">′</mo></msup></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\phi, \\phi&#x27; : \\Omega \\mid (| \\phi \\mathrel{R} \\phi&#x27; |), \\phi \\vdash \\phi&#x27;</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.9463em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">ϕ</span><span class=\"mpunct\">,</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.1667em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">ϕ</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.7519em;\"><span style=\"top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\">′</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">:</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">Ω</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">∣</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mopen\">(</span><span class=\"mord\">∣</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">ϕ</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.00773em;\">R</span></span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1.0019em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">ϕ</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.7519em;\"><span style=\"top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\">′</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"mord\">∣</span><span class=\"mclose\">)</span><span class=\"mpunct\">,</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.1667em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">ϕ</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">⊢</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.9463em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">ϕ</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.7519em;\"><span style=\"top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\">′</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> for some reflected axiom schema <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">R</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.00773em;\">R</span></span></span></span>.</p>\n<p>Did that do a better job of providing the intuition you were hoping for?</p>",

In particular, unlike our equivalence between triposes and evidenced frames, Miquel's tripos-to-implicative-algebra-to-tripos construction does not model the same HOL sentences as the original tripos. This is because Miquel's construction raises the cardinality of the model of propositions (by using a subset of the powerset of the original model of propositions); it does so specifically in order to be able to give its model of propositions the (meet semi-lattice) structure required of implicative algebras. So it would seem that entailment in triposes cannot be completely described be implicative algebras.</p>",

I'll blame my error on having stayed up all night with the baby!</p>\n<p>The weaker equivalence he ensures preserves HOL sentences that only use predicates \"extensionally\", including respecting extensional equivalence thereon. Much of the literature uses this weaker notion of equivalence for triposes because it is enough the tripos-to-topos constructions are indeed equivalent toposes (because such toposes quotient predicates by their extensional behavior). But if you care about triposes as themselves models of HOLs are as stepping stones to quasitoposes and intensional type theories, then you want the stronger equivalence we ensure.</p>",
