If AI is “just math” or “just a tool,” then one might think that ethics is simply irrelevant to research and development of AI systems. In contrast, I will argue that ethical issues arise throughout every step of AI creation, including research efforts that seem to be outside of the scope of ethics. That is, ethics is an intrinsic part of AI, not something that arises only after the fact. Throughout this argument, I will provide examples of practical tools and practices to improve the ethics in one’s AI systems. These insights and examples will apply to technology development in general, including fundamental mathematical research.</p>",
