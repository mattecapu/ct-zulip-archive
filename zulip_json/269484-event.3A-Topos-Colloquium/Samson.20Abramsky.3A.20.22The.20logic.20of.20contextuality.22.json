        "content": "<p>here's the abstract (though Samson has said that he doesn't intend to cover everything, and that the talk will be as self-contained as possible!)</p>\n<hr>\n<p>(joint work with Rui Soares Barbosa)</p>\n<p>Contextuality is a key signature of quantum non-classicality, which has been shown to play a central role in enabling quantum advantage for a wide range of information-processing and computational tasks. We study the logic of contextuality from a structural point of view, in the setting of partial Boolean algebras introduced by Kochen and Specker in their seminal work. These contrast with traditional quantum logic a la Birkhoff--von Neumann in that operations such as conjunction and disjunction are partial, only being defined in the domain where they are physically meaningful.</p>\n<p>We study how this setting relates to current work on contextuality such as the sheaf-theoretic and graph-theoretic approaches. We introduce a general free construction extending the commeasurability relation on a partial Boolean algebra, i.e. the domain of definition of the binary logical operations. This construction has a surprisingly broad range of uses. We apply it in the study of a number of issues, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>establishing the connection between the abstract measurement scenarios studied in the contextuality literature and the setting of partial Boolean algebras;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>formulating various contextuality properties in this setting, including probabilistic contextuality as well as the strong, state-independent notion of contextuality given by Kochen--Specker paradoxes, which are logically contradictory statements validated by partial Boolean algebras, specifically those arising from quantum mechanics;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>investigating a Logical Exclusivity Principle, and its relation to the Probabilistic Exclusivity Principle widely studied in recent work on contextuality as a step towards closing in on the set of quantum-realisable correlations;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>developing some work towards a logical characterisation of the Hilbert space tensor product, using logical exclusivity to capture some of its salient quantum features.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",
