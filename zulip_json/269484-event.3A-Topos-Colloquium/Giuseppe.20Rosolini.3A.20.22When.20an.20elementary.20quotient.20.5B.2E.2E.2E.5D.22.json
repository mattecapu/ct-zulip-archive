        "content": "<p><strong>Giuseppe Rosolini</strong>: <em>When an elementary quotient completion is a quasitopos</em></p>\n<p>The elementary quotient completion of an elementary doctrine generalises the exact completion of a category with finite products and weak equalisers. I intend to present a characterisation of those elementary quotient completions which produce a quasitopos. As a corollary one gets a characterisation of the elementary quotient completions which give an elementary topos. Our work is reminiscent of, and gathers ideas, from others: in particular, Carboni and Vitale’s characterisation of exact completions in terms of their projective objects, Carboni and Rosolini’s characterisation of locally cartesian closed exact completions, also in the revision by Emmenegger, and Menni’s characterisation of the exact completions which are elementary toposes. This is joint work with Maria Emilia Maietti and Fabio Pasquali.</p>\n<p>Zoom: <a href=\"https://topos-institute.zoom.us/j/84392523736?pwd=bjdVS09wZXVscjQ0QUhTdGhvZ3pUdz09\">https://topos-institute.zoom.us/j/84392523736?pwd=bjdVS09wZXVscjQ0QUhTdGhvZ3pUdz09</a><br>\nYouTube: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/9AyUEEeKUC8\">https://youtu.be/9AyUEEeKUC8</a></p>\n<div class=\"youtube-video message_inline_image\"><a data-id=\"9AyUEEeKUC8\" href=\"https://youtu.be/9AyUEEeKUC8\"><img src=\"https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/b5fa6af5f5128ed46b1b19746490d24838f95d43/68747470733a2f2f692e7974696d672e636f6d2f76692f394179554545654b5543382f64656661756c742e6a7067\"></a></div>",
