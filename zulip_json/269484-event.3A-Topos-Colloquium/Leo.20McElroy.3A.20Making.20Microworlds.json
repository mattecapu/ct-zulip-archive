The role of an educational technologist is to communicate this principle through tools provided to learners. A primary item in this toolmakers’ toolkit is the microworld, a concept developed by Seymour Papert as a “growing place for a specific species of powerful ideas or intellectual structures.” A microworld presents someone with a small set of ideas in an explorable environment which helps the learner recompose those ideas for their own personal expression. Following the development of a collection of microworlds, we will uncover the meta-structure of the “growing place” for intellectual structures, with the aim of identifying a framework for making tools, for making sense, by making things.</p>",
