But there were also several instances where we saw the harm that these technologies can cause when they are deployed too hastily. A Tesla crashed on Autopilot, killing the driver; a self-driving Uber crashed, killing a pedestrian; and commercial face-recognition systems performed terribly in audits on dark-skinned people. In response to that, there has been much recent talk of AI ethics. Many organizations produced AI-ethics guidelines and companies publicize their newly established responsible-AI teams.</p>\n<p>But talk is cheap. \"Ethics washing\" — also called “ethics theater” — is the practice of fabricating or exaggerating a company’s interest in equitable AI systems that work for everyone. An example is when a company promotes “AI for good” initiatives with one hand, while selling surveillance tech to governments and corporate customers with the other. I will argue that the ethical lens is too narrow. The real issue is how to deal with technology's impact on society. Technology is driving the future, but who is doing the steering?</p>\n<p>Zoom: <a href=\"https://topos-institute.zoom.us/j/84392523736?pwd=bjdVS09wZXVscjQ0QUhTdGhvZ3pUdz09\">https://topos-institute.zoom.us/j/84392523736?pwd=bjdVS09wZXVscjQ0QUhTdGhvZ3pUdz09</a><br>\nYouTube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW9WFOosaWc\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW9WFOosaWc</a></p>\n<div class=\"youtube-video message_inline_image\"><a data-id=\"qW9WFOosaWc\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qW9WFOosaWc\"><img src=\"https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/1459053ac49dc1edb43fa3b876c9e7df4e7caa16/68747470733a2f2f692e7974696d672e636f6d2f76692f71573957464f6f736157632f64656661756c742e6a7067\"></a></div>",
