This more general perspective has some advantages over the traditional pointwise approach to measure theory. For example, it facilitates the use of topos-theoretic techniques to study measurability. To this effect, a translation process between the internal language/ logic of certain Boolean topoi and the \"usual\" external language/ logic is required which we can accomplish by using the formalism of conditional analysis.  We illustrate this with some recent applications in ergodic theory.</p>",
