It says nothing about actual reality, unless you take as hypothesis that string theory is a model of the real world. It says nothing at all about consciousness, let alone any putative meaning of life. No one that I know of has picked up what Urs has put down, though David Corfield was involved with the discussions somewhat—but I don't see him doing anything like taking the process further into Hegel's work.</p>",

As far as I can tell, M-theory is lacking a dynamics, and Urs is trying to figure out the kinematics.  </p>\n<p>It's funny how people lose sight of this amid the piles of impressive math, Hegelian philosophy, etc.    But it's obvious if you observe what string theorists are doing.   If they actually had a candidate for what M-theory is - as a theory with dynamics - everyone would be trying to explain this theory to each other in simpler and simpler terms, and doing lots of calculations with it.   But in fact what we have are just some clues, which is a discouraging situation.  So there just a few people trying to work with those clues.</p>\n<p>If you look at <a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Hypothesis+H#StatementOfHypothesisH\">Hypothesis H</a>, it's just a guess about what sort of thing one of the fields in M-theory should be.  That's a hypothesis about the kinematics, not the dynamics: i.e., it doesn't say what this field <em>does</em>, just what type of thing it <em>is</em>, and thus what sort of things <em>could</em> happen.   It's like Einstein saying gravity should involve the metric on spacetime (which he did, long before formulating general relativity) or Schrodinger saying quantum mechanics should involve a complex-valued wavefunction (but not saying what equation this should obey).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At what point did GR or QM make the grade? </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>GR made the grade as soon as Einstein presented what we call Einstein's equations to the Prussian Academy of Physics on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_general_relativity#The_development_of_the_Einstein_field_equations\">November 25, 1915</a>.  If you've got some equation saying what matter does (and he did), that specifies the dynamics of GR.</p>\n<p>QM made the grade as soon as Schrodinger wrote down the time-dependent Schrodinger's equation.  I think he first did this <em>publicly</em> in the <a href=\"https://zbphysik.univie.ac.at/ausstellung/schroedinger/edokumenteOG/quantisierung4.htm\">fourth of his famous papers</a>, received by the <em>Annalen der Physik</em> on June 23, 1926.   I could be a bit wrong here, but I believe earlier papers only considered the time-independent equation, and only in this paper did he realize that the wavefunction must be complex!   I believe this version only applied to a single particle in a potential, but that's fine: it specifies the dynamics of this situation.  (It was soon generalized.)</p>",
