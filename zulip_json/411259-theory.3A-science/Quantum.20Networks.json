It is on quantum networks.</p>\n<p>I have been waiting for a while to see quantum causal structures.  This paper looks like some very good work done in this area.</p>\n<p>The way I see it, I am working on this too, but I am working on deriving things via data/distribution monads and compositions.  <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/385697008_A_No-Go_Theory_For_Spacetimes_of_Quantum_Systems\">You can see my work here</a>. </p>\n<p>In my paper, I use the fact that you cannot compose any comonad except the co-reader comonad with the distribution monad.  I wonder about the reverse, so quantum networks, i.e. the distribution monad comes first in the composition, on the left, and the comonad of domains (ordered structures) is on the right.  This would match what Matt Wilson has written about.  Might this work?  Shah might have only proved that you cannot compose on the left, but maybe you can compose on the right.</p>",
