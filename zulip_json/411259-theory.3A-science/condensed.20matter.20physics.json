An old physics definition of 'solid' says that solids are <em>crystals</em>.  This would exclude glasses and 'amorphous' solids like charcoal, which are often made of small crystals randomly piled next to each other.   Crystals are mathematically much easier to understand than these more random solids, and liquids.  Condensed matter physics tries to understand all these things.</p>",

There’s a cool story about the similarities between high-energy physics and condensed matter physics.</p>\n<p>In terms of the relevance of category theory - there are two main ways I’ve seen so far (though I’m relatively new to the field so I’m sure there are more). The first is <em>topology</em> - condensed matter is a setting where topological effects produce interesting nontrivial physics. Phenomena like the fractional quantum Hall effect, or anyons. It turns out that topological field theories are good tools to describe these, which can be thought of categorically as functors whose domain is an appropriate cobordism category. The braiding present within the category itself describes some of the most interesting parts of the physics!</p>\n<p>The second way I’m familiar with is through symmetry. Typically one imagines that group theory is the natural setting to discuss this, but somehow the materials nature produces end up being stranger. It’s helpful to consider so-called “higher form symmetries” which may or may not be invertible; these are usually implemented by topological operators, which depend on the homeomorphism type of some submanifold. Category theory provides a useful tool to organise these symmetries and study how they compose in a setting where invertibility isn’t guaranteed!</p>",

The \"extremely low temperature\" part lets us use beautiful math: at higher temperatures things get more random and complicated.  The \"thin film\" part lets use math like anyons and 3d TQFT that are relevant only when space is 2-dimensional.</p>",
