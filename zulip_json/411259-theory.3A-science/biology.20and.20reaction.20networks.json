My wife was involved in film festivals for a while and I was surprised when she talked about programming. My grandpa called TV shows \"programs\". Obviously the unifying thing is they're all about detailed instructions/planning. The only objection I could really get is that \"program\" seems to have a connotation of intention, somehow even more than \"code\" does, which doesn't exactly make sense for DNA.

For instance, in the second paper you mention, the authors clearly distinguish multiple modules (regulatory, metabolic, and signaling). In this regard, the process they study is viewed as an interconnection of modules. Non-modular, would mean that would have the same system with the same functionality, however we would not be able to clearly distinguish or separate the process into submodules, each with their on clear functionality that could be disconnected and studied on its own. This is essentially equivalent to saying that a reductionist approach does not apply and that this biological system should be approach using a holistic approach.</p>",

        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"609515\">@Kevin Carlson</span>  I am not sure to understand your point. The fact that we have difficulties predicting three dimensional structures of proteins based on their amino acid sequence is certainly one problem but this is an independent one. In any way, whether there is a mathematical function between codons and proteins and functionality or not, it does not change the fact that there is a mapping, whatever that mapping is, and biology knows and exploits that. Functionality does not stop at proteins but is also implemented at the network level and RNA/epigenetics does not complicate at all the \"computational metphor\", rather supports it. Epigenetics is about regulation and so are some types of mRNA such as small RNAs, microRNAs. As a side note, a non-negligible part of the DNA is human is non-coding, meaning that it does not code for proteins, and its functionality is regulatory in essence. For instance, proteins called transcription factors can bind to DNA at certain sites to modulate the activity of a gene. In the end a cell is all about computation and decision making. There are production chains (metabolic networks) to produce molecules required for the cell the survive or house keeping stuffs to make sure that everything is recycled. Oscillators are present to measure time and make decisions based on that. There are receptors (sensors) all over the place on the membrane that measure the environment and this information is transmitted to the inner working of the cells through signaling networks for the cell to make an appropriate decision, such as for instance, switching carbon source, apoptosis, compensate for shock, etc.</p>",

I got your point now.  </p>\n<p>For example,  one may study the time-varying gene expression data (find correlations between various gene expressions) with respect to a set of signals to a cell.  One may use various methods of data analysis for the same. One may obtain certain conclusions \"about how various genes are coexpressed with respect to various signals\".  Now, one may try to build an integrated model comprising signalling pathways, metabolic networks and gene regulatory networks associated with the given signals entering the cell  in such a way that dynamics of the integrated model matches the \"conclusion of the data analysis\" (upto certain extent) when we fit the model with the required biolgical data. Of course, this model is not perfect as it depends on a certain hypothesis <em>to match the output of the model</em> with the  biological conclusion coming from the conclusion of the said data analysis of gene expressions. Can we think of this model as a model built from an holistic approach? If yes, then,  other than starting from data, what are some approaches to model cellular decision making which can be considered as a holistic approach?</p>",

        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"520375\">@Adittya Chaudhuri</span>  This is a very good question. I do not have a definitive answer, only an opinion.</p>\n<p>In general, a holistic approach means analyzing a system as a whole rather than as a collection of independent modules that can be studied separately, which would correspond to reductionism.</p>\n<p>Let us consider a simple unicellular system such as a bacterium. A truly holistic approach would involve studying the entire cell directly, without decomposing it into subsystems that are analyzed in isolation. However, if the organism exhibits some form of modular structure, then analyzing those modules separately may be acceptable, provided that their environment is also incorporated into the model in some way to account for what we call context dependence.</p>\n<p>It is not unreasonable to assume that living systems display some degree of modularity, and this is precisely the assumption made when we study specific mechanisms or pathways, myself included. This simplification is necessary because a fully holistic approach remains far beyond our reach. We currently lack the biological understanding, computational resources, and mathematical tools required to model a living system in its entirety.</p>\n<p>Regarding your question, I would say that under certain weak modularity assumptions, where the overall signaling, metabolic, and regulatory networks are only loosely coupled to the rest of the cell, such an analysis could be considered holistic in a broad sense. However, this is rarely the case in practice and probably never will be completely true. Still, we need to start somewhere.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, data are the only direct source of information we have about biological processes. We can try to build phenomenological or mechanistic models to represent these data and attempt to reverse engineer what is happening. However, we often face fundamental limitations, such as the lack of predictive power: these models frequently fail to predict the outcome of new experiments or the emergence of previously unobserved behaviors, even qualitatively.</p>\n<p>If the goal of a model is simply to reproduce existing data, then yes, we know how to do that, and in fact, the vast majority of papers published in reputable biology journals report exactly this kind of modeling.</p>",

But it is difficult a priori to say if a approach is \"holistic enough\" in the case of biology. But if you assume that the content of the cell is just regulatory networks and model that as a whole, then yes I would say that it would count as a holistic approach. In reality, that will not be the case, though.</p>",
