My wife was involved in film festivals for a while and I was surprised when she talked about programming. My grandpa called TV shows \"programs\". Obviously the unifying thing is they're all about detailed instructions/planning. The only objection I could really get is that \"program\" seems to have a connotation of intention, somehow even more than \"code\" does, which doesn't exactly make sense for DNA. Well, unless you're talking about synthetic biology, which I think we might be!</p>",

There are probably even more layers of abstraction (assembly language, etc.).  I'm no expert on the ontology of computer science; someone must have thought a lot about this.</p>\n<p>Biology probably involves <em>different</em> layers of abstraction: there's no reason to assume it works the same way.   So if we're trying to understand the world of life, we shouldn't just transplant the concepts from computer science unthinkingly.    </p>\n<p>In synthetic biology we are, of course, free to impose any concepts we want, since we're designing new systems.   There we are only limited by <em>what works</em>.</p>\n<p>Personally I'm more interested in understanding the living world that came before us than synthetic biology.    I think we have a very crude attitude toward technology, and we have a lot to learn from the living world if we don't flatten it out.   It's been around for a lot longer than us, and it does amazing things we can barely fathom.   Right now we're busy pushing the world toward an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction\">mass extinction event</a>, which would be the first extinction event on Earth caused by a supposedly intelligent organism that messes with the biosphere too much before understanding it.</p>",
