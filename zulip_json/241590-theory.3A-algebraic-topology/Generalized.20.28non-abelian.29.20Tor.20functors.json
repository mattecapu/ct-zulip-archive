The Tor functor is the derived functor of tensoring with a fixed object in an abelian category. \"Derived functor\" can be understood as follows: You consider the induced functor on chain complexes in your given abelian category, given by tensoring levelwise. Chain complexes form a category with a class of weak equivalences (a \"homotopical category\"). Your induced functor does not respect these weak equivalences, and the derived functor is the closest one which does (formally: a certain Kan extension) -- seen like this the Tor functor is a functor on the category of chain complexes. You can get back the classical Tor functor by seeing an object of your original abelian category as a complex concentrated in degree 0, applying the derived functor, then taking cohomology.</p>",

Now you can call a morphism in your category an equivalence if homming out of it produces a weak equivalence of simplicial set, or equivalently if the induced map of simplicial sets, after geometric realization, becomes a homotopy equivalence of topological spaces. So in the end the role of simplicial objects is to endow your category with a notion of when a morphism is a weak equivalence. Also you can embed your original category into the category of simplicial objects as the constant simplicial objects. Thus you can construct \"resolutions\" of your original objects by seeing them as constant simplicial object and replacing them with an equivalent (in the sense sketched above) simplicial object which is levelwise \"good\" (in whatever sense you want, e.g. such that tensoring with them behaves well).</p>",
