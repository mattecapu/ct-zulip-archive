(mechanical meta materials, leaf venation, power grids, loop formation) I am not familiar with the literature on network theory, so pointers to good starting points in relation to these examples would be welcome.</p>\n<p>I am also unsure of the best stream to pose questions like this, suggestions are welcome. This is related to network topology, but not necessarily to algebraic topology. But I would be interested in comment on the measures using multi-scale minimum spanning trees and dual trees to a \"purely loopy network\". This vaguely reminds me of persistent homology in topological data analysis, I would also be interested on a categorical perspective on how that might be relevant to these examples.</p>",
