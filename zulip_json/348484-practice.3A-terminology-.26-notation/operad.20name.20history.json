Besides having a nice ring to it, the name is meant to bring to mind both operations and monads. Incidentally, I persuaded MacLane to discard the term “triple” in favor of “monad” in his book “Categories for the working mathematician” [17]1, which was being written about the same time. I was convinced that the notion of an operad was an important one, and I wanted the names to mesh.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is also the source given by Wikipedia, and no source seems to be given for the opera singer story. If Wikipedia is unable to source it, then that should be edited, no matter how fun it sounds.</p>",

It concerns the substitution of monad for triple as the name of a concept that all mathematicians here should know. He writes “The frequent but unfortunate use of the word ‘triple’ in this sense has achieved a maximum of needless confusion, what with the conflict with ordered triple, plus the use of associated terms such as ‘triple derived functors’ for functors which are not three times derived from anything in the world. Hence the term ‘monad’.” One reason I like this passage is that it is a beautiful illustration of the vividness of his writing, his sheer verve. Another is that it is so characteristic of his manner of arguing a point. But the third is personal. In the first draft he used the word triple, and I won him over. I had just defined operads, and I had coined that word to go well with monad.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Given all this, I believe the <em>main</em> reason for the name operad was that 'operad' is a blend of 'operation' and 'monad'; the opera business seems like an additional amusing twist, added on either at the time or later.</p>",
