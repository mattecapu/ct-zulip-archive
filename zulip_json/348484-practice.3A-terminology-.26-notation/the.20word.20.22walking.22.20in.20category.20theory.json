Over time, \"X \" or \"Xian\" can turn into a tag for broader generalizations that grow from the original work. I don't think more descriptive names have the same flexibility: Abelian categories would never have been named commutative categories (indeed even symmetric monoidal categories, where commutative would be a better fit, are not called commutative), a more descriptive name for Frobenius automorphisms would have prevented the creation of Frobenioids, etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>First of all, there's no reason that non-personal names cannot be used this way. Second, it is worth reflecting whether this is even desirable. I tend to find these situations unhelpful, because it involves overloading terminology in ways that can be confusing when you first encounter them. Third, I agree that a more descriptive name for Frobenius automorphisms may have not suggested the term \"Frobenioid\", but the way you phrase this makes it sound like \"Frobenioid\" is the ideal term, and we would have missed out if some other terminology was used. But this just isn't true: there's nothing objectively useful about \"Frobenioid\" compared to some other evocative choice of terminology.</p>",

Sometimes I think mathematicians regard it as self-evident that eponyms are bad, when in fact there are arguments to be made for the other side.</p>\n<p>Personally, I think most of the arguments for eponyms can be effortlessly generalized to argue for any (mathematical) <em>neologisms</em>.  The point is, sometimes we really want a <em>new</em> name for something rather than to reuse some ones that already have meaning in mathematics.  When we introduce a new word that doesn't previously have a mathematical meaning (whether or not it is an existing word in some natural language), we are free to define it to mean one specific thing, without the danger of confusion with other meanings of that word.  And a new word can then also have its meaning expanded in turn over time to refer to other related things.

The reason seems to be that \"Markov category\" is more evocative of the main example (so, it has a similar idea as \"Abelian category\", but instead of coming from the objects, it comes from the morphisms, which are Markov kernels). However, \"CD-category\" is consistently used and it's becoming standard terminology, so this motivates me to say that \"affine CD\" is a very good name from a descriptive perspective.</p>",

And there are certainly many examples of such neologisms if you exclude this constraint. One might argue that when people are forced to invent terminology, it's advantageous for there to be some connection to the original intuition, no matter how tenuous, so long as the connection is not so strong as to make the term inflexible.</p>\n<p>However, one example that appeared earlier in this thread and I think fits your criteria is \"operadic\", which had no mathematical connotations prior to its introduction by May, but is now used to refer to various structures that resemble operads, e.g. operadic categories.</p>",
