While there is no formal definition of cellular colimit, morally a construction is cellular if it formed by taking directed colimits or pushouts. Now, your situation is the one in which you are not entirely allows to glue stuff, you can only <em>glue along the empty set</em>,  which is what I would call <em>append</em>.</p>",
