Can you ELI5 why are they so upsetting for people?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Let me try to answer this. (I'm not attacking you or anyone, just trying to answer the question.)<br>\nMy very personal opinion (as someone who can't stop making nerdy jokes, ask my colleagues...) is still to avoid any sexual, political or religious references when naming mathematical entities (and software, etc).</p>\n<p>The reason is that <em>we don't know who the audience will be</em>. When we tell a joke to a group of friends, colleagues, etc, we more or less know what makes them laugh, what could trigger them, offend them, or what could simply not be funny. (If a friend of mine has just lost his mother, I'm not going to make a \"yo momma\" joke, right?) Of course not every joke lands perfectly, and some times things get awkward anyway, but we try. Now, this strategy, crucially, <em>cannot possibly work when writing math or software</em>. </p>\n<p>The thing is, mathematics is so universal and cross-cultural that it's impossible to know the background, culture, and ideas of everyone who will study it, especially in the future. And references to sex, politics and religion are the most likely ones to land badly. (For an Italian-to-Italian example: think of a foreigner that comes to Italy and starts saying <em>bestemmie</em> left and right. Some will laugh, some will be offended, some might even start a fight, and there is no way for the foreigner to know in advance.)</p>\n<p>The risk is that math that <em>could have perfectly reached someone</em> from a different background, instead fails, because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Maybe the name is offensive to them, or makes them uncomfortable, especially if they talk about it in public (e.g. that's why <a href=\"https://nforum.ncatlab.org/discussion/3268/rocq/\">Rocq</a> changed name);</li>\n<li>Maybe the name gets them likely to be investigated, cancelled, threatened, or misunderstood (ironically, that's what seems to be happening with <em>homology</em> in the US under Trump);</li>\n<li>Or more pragmatically, the name is so distracting that, every time the concept is approached, the conversation just ends up turning into a series of jokes (or, worse, into a political discussion). Maybe engaging, but such a waste of brain power! The thing is, we are human, and for as much as we may love math, things like \"Ass\" or \"Fascist\" or \"Hell\" will still draw our attention away from things like \"Let's see if this epsilon depends not only on delta, but also on x\".<br>\n(For example, literally every conversation I've heard about Rocq <em>in my entire life</em> turned into a discussion about its name, one way or another.) </li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is of course not just limited to sex, politics and religion. The risk is always there. But these three are by far the most risky ones - it's just much easier to avoid those three altogehter. Or at least, that's my very personal opinion. <br>\n(And I assure you, even without these, I still have plenty of material for stupid jokes.)</p>",
