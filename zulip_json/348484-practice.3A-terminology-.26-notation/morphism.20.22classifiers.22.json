In some places in category theory, notably in the notion of <a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/subobject%20classifier\">[[subobject classifier]]</a>, a \"classifier\" is something that has a mapping-in universal property. However, in two-dimensional category theory, a <a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/pseudo%20morphism%20classifier\">[[pseudo morphism classifier]]</a> has a mapping-out universal property. It seems to me that it would be clearer to call the latter a \"pseudo morphism coclassifier\" (which reflects the fact that it can be constructed as a colimit).</p>\n<p>Is this just a poor choice of terminology, or is there a good reason it should be a \"pseudo morphism classifier\" rather than  \"pseudo morphism coclassifier\"?</p>",
