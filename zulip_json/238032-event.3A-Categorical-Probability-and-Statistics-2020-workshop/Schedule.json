(Alex uses the category of Quasi-Borel Spaces to put the semantics of probabilistic programming on sound footing.  He talked about this work at David/Brendan/Paolo's seminar, but there wasn't enough time to really get into the category theory.  Lovers of monads, and those who have worried about conditioning in the presence of distributions that lack full support, will enjoy this paper.)</p>",
