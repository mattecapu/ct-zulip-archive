There is a lot of work going on in this direction in the verification community in computer science. There is so much being done, I find it a bit challenging to keep up with.</p>",

This is really a huge and active area. I don't have a particularly clear mental picture of it, and I  can't really single out any particular thread of work as of especial interest to people here. I was more emphasising the high degree of activity.  If you look at any recent conference in semantics/verification/programming languages you will find plenty of examples of this kind of work.</p>",
