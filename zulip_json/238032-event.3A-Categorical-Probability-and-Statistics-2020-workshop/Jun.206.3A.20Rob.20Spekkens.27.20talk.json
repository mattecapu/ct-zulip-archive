With regards to the EPR experiment you mentioned, you had a slide with analogues of Bayesian inference in terms of density matrices and certain star products. So in EPR, if one observer sees spin up, is the update density matrix based on your formalism on the right side of that slide the density matrix for spin down for the other observer? If so, could you please point me to which paper discusses this (and more precisely where)?</p>",

If I understood what Rob said, then I think he said a <em>classical</em> model that was conservative and inferential (as opposed to a quantum one). If one uses a quantum model with a common cause (such as the EPR state), then you can reproduce statistics that do not coincide with the classical statistics. Right?</p>",

What Bell's theorem shows is that one cannot be both causally conservative <em>and</em> inferentially conservative.  That is, one cannot explain Bell inequality violations using a common cause structure <em>if</em> one presumes that a classical theory of inference dictates how one ought to propagate beliefs (that is, how one uses what one learns about the outcome at one side of the experiment to update what one knows about the unobserved common cause and thereby update what one knows about the outcome at the other side) .  The research program I described aims to salvage a common-cause explanation (i.e., a causally conservative explanation) by presuming that the common cause is not a classical variable but a more exotic object, and that propagating beliefs through such a common cause is dictated by a novel calculus of inference.   </p>\n<p>You can read more about the \"causal gloss\" on Bell's theorem in this article:<br>\nChristopher J.

I finally got around to checking the definitions and verifying that for EPR it indeed reproduces the expected correlations. I read your paper with Leifer about a year ago, but I did not quite understand how the belief propagation worked because I (incorrectly) thought you were only using the distortion map (I think I already forgot what you call it, but I'm referring to the recovery map), and I wasn't able to reproduce the correlations with that method.</p>",
