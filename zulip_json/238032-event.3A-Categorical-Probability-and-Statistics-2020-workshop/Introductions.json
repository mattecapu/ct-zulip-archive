Despite a strong interest in the foundations of physics, I now mainly do pure math with a view on its applications.</p>\n<p>My two focus areas are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Category-theoretic approaches to probability, the subject matter of this workshop.</li>\n<li>The theory of ordered algebraic structures, in particular ordered rings and semirings, together with applications to probability and information theory.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In categorical probability, Paolo and I have been working on various probability monads for a few years. More recently, I have been developing <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07021\">Markov categories</a>, and I have come to regard them as forming the most promising approach to categorical probability.</p>\n<p>During this workshop, I hope to learn more about the demands and perspectives of other fields on categorical probability, including probabilistic programming, applied statistics and noncommutative/quantum probability.</p>",

I'm interested in developing software with strong theoretical underpinnings with strong safety guarantees -- this is something all too often lacking  in statistical software and scientific software in general.

My research interests also include looking at causal inference through a category theoretic lens and applications to applied and theoretical ecology (though as a workaday programmer, I don't have much time for these interests).</p>\n<p>During the workshop, I hope to finally understand what a statistical model is.</p>",
