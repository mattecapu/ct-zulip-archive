But how do we know what the \"correct\" definition of probability measure is on less well-behaved spaces, such as uncountable product spaces, spaces with bad separation, etc? Then the definition of probability measure branches into a number of non-equivalent notions. Already the standard definition of probability measure can be applied to the Borel <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>σ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\sigma</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\" style=\"margin-right:0.03588em;\">σ</span></span></span></span>-algebra or to the Baire <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>σ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\sigma</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\" style=\"margin-right:0.03588em;\">σ</span></span></span></span>-algebra, which are different in general.

So I think that yes, it is a problem at the level of definitions to some extent. And the preservation of <em>all</em> cofiltered limits may (or may not) be one criterion for a good definition. As I've already mentioned, the Radon monad achieves this (but has other deficiencies).</p>\n<p>A related issue is that the Borel <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>σ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\sigma</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\" style=\"margin-right:0.03588em;\">σ</span></span></span></span>-algebra functor from (say) Hausdorff spaces to measurable spaces does not preserve uncountable products. For example, if we naively took an uncountable product of <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"double-struck\">R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathbb{R}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.68889em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathbb\">R</span></span></span></span></span> with itself in order to describe the joint distribution of uncountably many real-valued random variables, then we would not be able to talk about the probability of all of those variables taking the same value, since the diagonal would not be a measurable set! This seems clearly undesirable to me. (In practice the diagonal will still be Caratheodory measurable, but that only illustrates my point: the product <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>σ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\sigma</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\" style=\"margin-right:0.03588em;\">σ</span></span></span></span>-algebra is too small to be the \"correct\" one.)</p>\n<p>In summary, I don't think that we should consider the definition of probability space to be set in stone. In particular, measure theory often has aspects which involve not just a measurable structure, but also a topology on the underlying space, for example for uncountable products or for talking about supports. And I think that when constructing probability monads beyond Polish spaces or standard Borel spaces, we should take that topological structure into account. Then the question arises of what the optimal way to do that will be.</p>\n<p>Does this seem reasonable to you? Apologies if my thoughts on this aren't so well-organized yet.</p>",

Hence for any particular Markov category, one will need a Kolmogorov theorem, unless there is a synthetic proof of such theorem.
