If I understand correctly, you've observed that an AQFT can be formulated as an internal C*-algebra on a suitable topos of copresheaves on spacetime regions. Very roughly, we're doing an analogous thing for Euclidean QFTs by writing them as internal \"probability spaces\" in a topos of presheaves on spacetime (plus a mild sheaf condition).</p>",
