I think that characterisation looks right. Many concrete analyses of eg a program usually focusses on stand alone secrets and so this problem does not arise. It's only when one tries to compose things together that the analysis forces one to think about these things. In those little snuppets \"print (x&gt;0)\" there are no state changes and so everything is easier, because the \"original secret\"  is still what it was.</p>",
