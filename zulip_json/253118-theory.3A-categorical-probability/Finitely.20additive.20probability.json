(Hence, I think, it can be defined in terms of atomic Boolean algebras instead of <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>σ</mi><mo>−</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\sigma-</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.66666em;vertical-align:-0.08333em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.03588em;\">σ</span><span class=\"mord\">−</span></span></span></span> algebras.) There's a paper about its implications here:</p>\n<p>Kadane, Schervish and Seidenfeld (1986) <a href=\"https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/philosophy/docs/seidenfeld/Stat%20implications%20FA.pdf\">Statistical Implications of Finitely Additive Probability</a></p>\n<p>I'm wondering if it's been studied from the perspective of category-theoretic probability. For example, if one defined a monad of finitely additive probability measures and took its Kleisli category, would that result in a 'nicer' Markov category than the one you get from normal, countably additive probability measures? Given such a category of finitely additive Markov kernels, is there a category-theoretic way to extract the ones that are also countably additive?</p>\n<p>It seems like often this kind of generalisation is worthwhile in category theory, so I wondered if this particular one has been studied.</p>",
