The first problem now is that this doesn't make sense in general, because many sequences don't have well-defined relative frequencies. Therefore the transformation can at most be partially defined. Another issue is that you can have two sequences for which the relative frequencies do converge, and even be identical so that you get the same element of <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>P</mi><mi>X</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">PX</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.07847em;\">PX</span></span></span></span>, even if the sequences do not differ by a finite permutation. (They don't even necessarily differ by an infinite permutation, because one may contain elements with relative frequency zero!) So although a partial transformation exists, there's no simple characterization of when two elements of its domain get mapped to the same element of the codomain.</p>\n<p>(There are further analytical subtleties that we've had to struggle with, which is part of why it's taken us a few years to get to the point where we have a draft.)</p>",

My result rules this out for the Giry monad on Borel: if Giry is free on a transcendental coinflip, it implies the Giry monad has many automorphisms: for every pair of transcendental numbers, there is a monad morphism carrying one to the other. But such an automorphism is determined by where it carries the fair coinflip (since this generates the Giry monad, too) and must carry the fair coinflip to itself (because it must be carried to a symmetric coinflip, of which there is only one). Hence the Giry monad has no nontrivial automorphisms. I think this also works for many other probability monads (like on CHaus and so on), at least if you believe the fair coinflip generates the whole monad (but not necessarily freely), and it seems hard to believe that a transcendental coinflip is generating but not a fair one.</p>",
