        "content": "<p>Hey, glad to see my little doodle sparked a conversation! I've had a few thoughts since posting:</p>\n<p>For the one-sided cousin diagram (the kind posted, not including in-laws), I think labelling the columns -1, 0, 1, 2, ... makes sense. It corresponds to counting only the generations <em>properly</em> between the people in question and their most recent common ancestor: my sibling is my 0-cousin because there are zero generations between us and our mrca, our parents. Deciding that \"there are -1 generations between me and my mrca with X\" means \"I am my mrca with X, i.e. X is my descendant\" is a consistent choice.</p>\n<p>However, for the proposed two-sided diagram (which I want to make), I do feel like Me=(0,0) is the logical choice and that there's no reason symmetry should be about -1. It seems more logical to relabel the \"Me\" column to 0, the sibling column to 1, the first cousin to 2, and so on. That way your \"spouse\" (more precisely: \"co-parent\" or \"biological spouse\", the other parent of your children) is your (-1,0) cousin, reflecting that they have the opposite relation to you as your (1,0) cousin, your sibling. Likewise, your (-2,0) cousins, the other grandparents of your grandchildren, have the opposite place as your \"first cousins\", your (2,0) cousins. The mismatch with the traditional numbering is unfortunate, but worth it in my opinion</p>",

From a logico-mathematical point of view, past and future should be symmetrical.  Your 1st cousin is still your 1st cousin even after your shared grandparents are no longer alive, so logically your (-2)nd cousin should already be your (-2)nd cousin even <em>before</em> your shared child is alive.  Of course as a practical matter we are always speaking <em>at</em> some point in time and we don't know for sure what will happen in the future.  But it doesn't seem unreasonable to me to use the observable (and more socially relevant) relation \"spouse\" as a proxy for the unobservable \"present <em>or future</em> co-parent\".  In cases when precision is required one could add an adjective like \"biological\".</p>",
