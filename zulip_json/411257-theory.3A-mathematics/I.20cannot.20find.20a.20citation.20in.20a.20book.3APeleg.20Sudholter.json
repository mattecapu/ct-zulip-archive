But a lot of people seem to be siding with LLMs over librarians when it comes to these made-up citations: <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/librarians-arent-hiding-secret-books-from-you-that-only-ai-knows-about-2000698176\">https://gizmodo.com/librarians-arent-hiding-secret-books-from-you-that-only-ai-knows-about-2000698176</a></p>",

They really go out of their way to figure out what you believe and confirm it, even if they have to make up citations that don't exist or say things they're perfectly capable of realizing aren't true.  You can make up for this for some extent with prompting, especially if you have enough access to override part or all of the system prompt, but it's also part of post-training so it's hard to erase entirely with a prompt.  It also helps to never be even slightly assertive in stating something you are not absolutely certain of, but even leading questions can cause this behavior so it's not so easy to avoid.</p>",
