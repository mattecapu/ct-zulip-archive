The theorem provers do/can emit proofs of equality in a finitely presented 1-category, which presumably are related to 2-cells in finitely presented 2-categories.  We can certainly ask, 'are two equality proofs equivalent' for various notions of equivalent, where the hope would be 'equivalence' turns into e.g. checking equivalence of (lambda?) terms that represent the proofs / 2-cells.  This approach seems related to the Hilken 1999 'towards a proof theory of re-writing' paper, but I haven't worked anything out rigorously.
