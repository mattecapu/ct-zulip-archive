See Remark 11.29 <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07021\">here</a>, which implies for example that <a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/FinStoch\">[[FinStoch]]</a> is a monoidal category in which every object has a unique comonoid structure.</p>\n<p>The fact that FinStoch is not cartesian is in a sense what probability is all about, namely the fact that a joint distribution of two random variables is not uniquely determined by its two marginals.</p>",
