In this article they cover ways of doing general relativity without calculus in what they call \"non-smooth surfaces\"- spacetimes where there can be edges and discontinuities like singularities. The goal is to try and extend results from GR (such as singularity theorems) to the non-smooth setting in the case that non-smooth geometry better describes the universe than smooth geometry (the article argues this to be the case, but I personally don't see why, since GR has achieved great success in its current smooth form). Though it is a little confusing that there'd be this research program when the major consensus among physicists is that singularities are mere mathematical artifacts and do not exist in any physical sense.</p>",

Usual differential geometry does not apply, but the article cites how some calculus-like results are still possible in these spaces. This makes me wonder how this effort might relate to synthetic differential geometry- might there be some variant of that which applies to this category, or maybe this will eventually inspire a new field of \"synthetic non-smooth geometry\" as a generalization of synthetic differential geometry. <br>\nOne proposed definition for \"non-smooth spacetime\" is given <a href=\"https://ef-geometry.univie.ac.at/about/#sec-5\">here</a> (on the official website, Quanta does not usually go into the mathematical details). These are called \"Lorentzian pre-length spaces\". It doesn't seem immediately clear what (if anything) these have to do with Minkowski space. Ideally, even a non-smooth spacetime should still, in some sense \"locally look like\" Minkowski space. So I'm not sure how that manifests here- something to think about!</p>",

The question of which solutions are'\"mere artifacts\" slowly becomes easier to answer as we gain more knowledge.   So there's been a huge research program of studying singularities in general relativity, starting with the Nobel-winning work of Penrose and parallel work of Hawking, and continuing to this day.    </p>\n<p>For example, an interesting question is whether singularities in general relativity are always hidden behind an event horizon.

A coordinate singularity is certainly a mathematical artifact even from within GR, since it isn't diffeomorphism invariant: you can change your coordinates to remove it (IE, the event horizon of a BH). A curvature singularity is the kind the article talks about, it's a diffeomorphism invariant point where GR predicts its own failure and \"blows up\". It's not technically an artifact in GR- it's a direct prediction of GR thanks to the singularity theorems. What I meant by \"artifact\" was that it seems (at least by my impression) to be a popular belief that the incorporation of quantum mechanics will resolve the singularity. For instance, in traditional QM, singularities are impossible because Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states it's impossible to infinitely localize something in space, hence it's not possible for there to be a point with infinite density and zero volume.</p>",

He mentions this in the papers from the mid/late 1930s, where the theory was still rather crude, and only after Schwartz introduced distributions (also so-named because of electromagnetism! But this time distributions of charges) did de Rham recognise how to write his  currents in terms of the dual of a space of compactly-supported smooth test forms.</p>",

If you're trying to see what happens when two neutron stars collide, you don't extremize an action functional over all Lorentzian metrics on a fixed manifold.  You solve an initial value problem, where (very roughly) you're given the metric on space and its time derivative at <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">t = 0</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6151em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">t</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">=</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">0</span></span></span></span>, and you're trying to solve for the metric on spacetime at future times.   Then, depending on how you do things, the manifold on which the solution is defined typically depends on the initial data.</p>",

The blue ring is light from a galaxy behind the Cosmic Horseshoe, severely bent by gravity.</p>\n<p>This black hole is 36 billion times the mass of the Sun. It’s not just ‘<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole\">supermassive</a>’: any black hole over 10 billion times the Sun’s mass is considered ‘<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_massive_black_holes\">ultramassive</a>’. Not many have been found.</p>\n<p>To me the coolest part is that the Cosmic Horseshoe has swallowed all the other galaxies in its group: it’s part of something called a ‘fossil group’.</p>\n<p>Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is part of a group too: the Local Group. Many smaller galaxies have already fallen into ours. Eventually the Milky Way and Andromeda may collide and form a single bigger galaxy. This will be an ‘<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptical_galaxy\">elliptical galaxy</a>’—too disorganized to have spiral arms. So it’s not surprising that if you wait long enough, galaxy groups form a single big elliptical galaxy which eventually eats the rest.</p>\n<p>Some ancient galaxy groups have already done this, and they’re called '<a href=\"https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/*/Fossil+Groups\">fossil groups</a>’. The Cosmic Horseshoe is the biggest galaxy in one particular fossil group: it’s 100 times heavier than the Milky Way. It’s surrounded by a halo of very hot gas, 10 million Kelvin, emitting lots of X rays. But most of its mass can’t be explained by stars, gas and dust, so we say 90% is dark matter. All this is completely typical of a fossil group, except the Cosmic Horseshoe is bigger than average.</p>\n<p>Fossil groups show us what the future will be like. Big galaxies will eat the rest, and big black holes at the center of these galaxies will eventually eat most of the matter. Dark matter—whatever that is—takes longer to fall in. But there’s plenty of time.</p>\n<p>Here’s the new paper about this ultramassive black hole. Luckily, it’s free to read:</p>\n<p>• Carlos R. Melo-Carneiro, Thomas E. Collett, Lindsay J.

It's about how a particular calculation in quantum gravity for a closed de sitter universe leaves the Hilbert space of the universe at a single dimension- essentially, it leaves it seemingly \"empty of information\". The physicists interviewed for the article go on to suggest a potential way to solve this problem is to introduce an observer into the universe, which then of course implies that observers are required for the physics to work. </p>\n<p>Of course, I have many issues with the concept of needing \"observers\" in physics. My main objection is that humans (and any other animals that might count as \"observers\") are a non-fundamental part of the universe, and it feels weird to have to include something so non-fundamental into a fundamental theory of reality. So I automatically find any theory that requires macroscopic observers to be suspect.</p>",

The authors mention an \"island formula\" which is used to make sense of black holes (IE, in the BH information paradox). That's all fine and good, but here's where I think the mistake is: black holes and AdS spaces are the domain of applicability of the island formula, so trying to apply it to a closed de sitter universe means physicists are applying it outside its domain of applicability. Sure, it seems they can make it work mathematically, but that doesn't mean the physics will work. For instance, you could mathematically extend the Riemann zeta function to negative numbers via analytic continuation, but that doesn't mean you can interpret -1/12 to be the sum of every positive integer.</p>\n<p>With the island formula, it seems the main issue is that it works best with the idea of a boundary, since in holographic principle the boundary is where the information about the black hole or AdS space exists. But a closed de sitter universe has no boundary. So perhaps we shouldn't be so surprised when a technique developed in the context of an information-storing boundary claims \"zero information\" when used in a situation where there are zero boundaries? Again, I'm not an expert in QG so I might be misinterpreting things, any corrections are welcome!</p>",

For instance, say we have a spherical universe and we choose an arbitrary great circle. One one hemisphere with respect to this great circle, the sphere is filled with uniform matter, and on the other side, it isn't. If we make the dividing cut along the great circle, we end up with one part of the universe with matter, and the other part empty. On the other hand, if we cut perpendicular to it, we end up with two parts of the universe both containing equal amounts of matter. These are two very different situations.</p>",

We could argue about whether the positions and velocities of particles in Minkowski spacetime count as \"actual physics\" - after all, they depend on a choice of frame of reference, they're not absolute.  But that's an argument for philosophers.   Most physicists are happy enough to say: if you and I choose different frames of reference we'll say different things about the positions and velocities of particles, but we have a systematic recipe to convert my positions and velocities to yours, and the scheme all hangs together.  So frame-dependent quantities don't bother us - after we've been through the trauma of learning special relativity, and recovered from it, and seen that it makes sense.</p>\n<p>Somewhat similarly, but in a more complicated way, we can define and compute quantities that depend on a split of the universe into two parts, but there are ways to relate different splittings, and the scheme all hangs together.</p>\n<p>(It's more complicated because now there's not just a group acting on the set of inertial frames, but a category whose objects are splittings of the universe.)</p>",

The misunderstanding is that the results of the paper directly imply the fate of the universe will be a Big Crunch. I've read through the paper twice and have seen no mention at all of a Big Crunch or anything about the potential fate of the universe, beyond predictions of when the universe's expansion might start decelerating if it hasn't started to do so yet. So this is clearly an extrapolation by the authors of these popular articles rather than a direct statement from the science itself. </p>\n<p>One potential explanation is due to a simple misunderstanding of basic physics. The authors of these articles might have seen \"decelerating\" and confused it with \"contracting\". Even if the universe's expansion was currently decelerating, it would still be expanding, not contracting. Confusing deceleration for contraction is the same as confusing acceleration with velocity, a basic physics mistake.</p>",

Given what we know, that the universe seems to have a flat geometry, the Friedmann Equations predict that without dark energy the expansion would simply slow and asymptotically coast to a stop. The DESI-suggested weakening of dark energy is just a milder version of this scenario, so the cosmic fate would be the same. Unless the universe is actually closed on scales we can’t observe, or the FLRW metric fails to actually describe our universe, a future recollapse appears essentially impossible.</p>",
