If the reals represent continuity as compared to rationals, couldn’t a number set of greater cardinality than the reals appear even <em>more</em> “continuous”, than the reals? (Because there are even <em>more</em> points, in any given interval).</p>\n<p>(Do the hyperreal or superreal numbers have this property?)</p>\n<p>Should the idea of “continuity” be reformulated, so that there are even continuous functions on rational numbers, or natural numbers?</p>\n<p>It seems like in modern physics people generally take nature as “discrete”.</p>\n<p>If space and/or time are “quantized”, does this imply a more accurate model of the frequency of a soundwave would be rational numbers, not reals?</p>\n<p>One of the key ideas in Schönbergian dodecaphonic music is that by enforcing the use of all twelve tones in a measure (a “measure” is a rhythmic unit, essentially), you force the ear to never highlight certain groups of notes as “prominent”. This (allegedly) prevents the human mind from finding a “tonal center” which it hears the other notes as “relative to”. (A non-repeating sequence of the 12 tones is called a “tone row”; in mathematics, they are called “permutations”).</p>\n<p>I have been thinking how many mathematical ideas there are to explore, regarding this.</p>\n<p>We normally count the number of permutations of <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.4306em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">n</span></span></span></span> elements as <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">!</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">n!</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6944em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">n</span><span class=\"mclose\">!</span></span></span></span>. </p>\n<p>This comes from a simple argument of thinking about “choices” - “12 options for the first choice, 11 options for the second choice, …”.</p>\n<p>I have been wondering lately if there is a more systematic way to formulate combinatorial expressions.</p>\n<p>All the techniques I have seen require that a human can make a sound assessment of a given situation. There is not a single “routine” you can follow to always write the correct combinatorial expression of a given situation.</p>\n<p>What if there was? For example, what if there were a “semantics” of counting, where just by writing the situation in those semantics, you could apply logical axioms to derive a formula for calculating a number they are equivalent to?</p>\n<p>Those semantics would express some of the basic ideas we encounter when “counting” things, like, “for each…”, “options”, and so on.</p>\n<p>For example, in the case of choosing <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mn>12</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">!</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">12!</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6944em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">12</span><span class=\"mclose\">!</span></span></span></span> as the “correct” expression for “how many unique tone rows are there?”, maybe we could break it apart into some “cognitive steps”, like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>there is a background set <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>S</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">S</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.05764em;\">S</span></span></span></span> of “12 unique things”</li>\n<li>my question is about sub-collections of <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>S</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">S</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.05764em;\">S</span></span></span></span> with 12 elements</li>\n<li>repetition of the elements is not allowed</li>\n<li>there are no other constraints (no requirements on the arrangement of the elements, no function or property they must fulfill)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then we could maybe think:</p>\n<p>We have a set of cardinality 12. </p>\n<p>The most elemental operation we can take on it (in this context) is the cartesian product. I know that I want 12 “instances” or “copies” of the set, so this is a “12-ary” cartesian product of sets.</p>\n<p>This reminds me of diagrams in category theory, where the Cartesian product would be replaced by a “product object”. Is there a name for a unique morphism that maps an object to a product object? An “inclusion” mapping? A “product” <em>map</em>?</p>\n<p>Sets also have the disjoint union, which is the “categorical sum” or “coproduct” (I think). </p>\n<p>Disjoint unions are like cartesian products, except every element retains an “index” to differentiate it.</p>\n<p>Could disjoint unions be defined in terms of cartesian products?

If the categories are concrete (defined as sets), it makes sense to say “the cardinality of <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>O</mi><mi>b</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>C</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">Ob(C)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.02778em;\">O</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">b</span><span class=\"mopen\">(</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.07153em;\">C</span><span class=\"mclose\">)</span></span></span></span> is 7”. But in an abstract category, we need a categorical way, internal to the category, to say that. Do we say there is an arrow from a natural numbers object to the object, with a property like being isomorphic?</p>\n<p>What does a factorial object look like, in a category? Could we talk about the <em>number</em> of permutations of 12 elements as an object in a category, without ever needing to compute the integer value?</p>\n<p>If a purely dodecaphonic composition is an arrangement of tone rows, then for each measure, we can have <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.4306em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">n</span></span></span></span> tone rows playing simultaneously, and we can have a sequence of any number of such “bundles” of tone rows.</p>\n<p>The simultaneous tone rows must be unique.

A sequence of 4ths (which is 0 + 5 mod 12: 0, 5, 10, 3, 8, 1, 6, 11, 4, 9, 2, 7, 0) sounds way more “diatonic” than some other tone rows.</p>\n<p>I want to catch up with David Egolf’s thread about sheaf theory. I am interested in the idea that a sheaf tracks instances of local data and ensures they correspond to a global representation of the data. I wonder if the idea of a “tonal center” having “levels of scope”, from the smallest locality, to the total scope of the composition, could be modeled this way.</p>\n<p>I appreciate any clear simple answers to my above questions. Thanks very much.</p>",
