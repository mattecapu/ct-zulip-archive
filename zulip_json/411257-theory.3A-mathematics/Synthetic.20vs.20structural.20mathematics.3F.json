In analytic mathematics, we are interested in a particular class of objects, and what statements are true <em>of that</em> class of objects; there is typically no \"flexibility\" about \"what the theory is about\". In synthetic mathematics, we are interested in <em>what statements follow from other statements</em>. We may read the latter as statements <em>about some class of objects</em>, and in the best case there is a soundness-and-completeness theorem which says that a family of statements characterises precisely a class of objects as its class of models, but one may do away with it and simply think of the \"object of study\" being \"objects that satisfy these axioms\".</p>",

For in analysis we suppose that which is sought to be already done, and we inquire from what it results, and again what is the antecedent of the latter, until we on our backward way light upon something already known and being first in order.

To be mildly obscene with nPOV, a reductionist view to me feels like \"0-compositionality\"—the compound structure is simply the sum of its parts. Where reductionism fails we observe emergent properties, and maybe a goal when solving problems with compositionality could be to investigate if those emergent properties can be studied by 1-, or higher-order composition—a compound structure is the sum of its parts and the relationships between those parts (and maybe the relationships between those relationships too in the case of composing higher-order morphisms). But in principle, some emergent phenomena may not be characterized \"just\" by compositionality altogether and may require an entirely different framework to capture the emergent aspects.</p>\n<p>Probably just reiterating what I initially said, but I don't think structuralism is opposite to compositionality—to me, structuralism is the philosophical perspective that the Yoneda Lemma makes precise, which is hand-in-hand with compositionality.

Or maybe it could be one of a few different interpretations of what structuralism is about seeing that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structuralism_(philosophy_of_mathematics)\">Wikipedia already lists three distinct flavors</a>.</p>",

One can make an argument that this is anti-materialistic because it de-emphasises the role of any specific matter as being \"the real, actual matter\" underlying mathematical objects, but one can equally make the opposite argument that, instead, this \"materialises all structure\": in this sense, you can see an object with a universal property as being something like the \"minimal implementation of a structure\"---the one that has to be represented in every other implementation---and so CT prefers to reduce a structure to its \"minimal materialisation\".</p>",

But in principle, some emergent phenomena may not be characterized \"just\" by compositionality altogether and may require an entirely different framework to capture the emergent aspects.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Just as a side note on this philosophically lexical point, I’m quite confident that, a significant part of reductionists would be happy to welcome the existence of emergent phenomena, precisely as higher-orderly composed of elementary parts. They might be considerably easier to describe with an entirely different framework than those used for those elementary parts, but anyway also be so by this elementary framework, through this eminently complex tower of higher-order relationships that make them emerge from the elementary parts.</p>",
