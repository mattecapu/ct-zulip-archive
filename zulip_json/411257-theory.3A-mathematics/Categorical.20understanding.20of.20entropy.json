The slide can be download at  my researchgate page </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387227889_Copula_Operad_and_Copula_Entropy\">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/387227889_Copula_Operad_and_Copula_Entropy</a> .</p>\n<p>This work is motivated by  theory of remormalization group and coarse-grainings.  <br>\nIt is well known that there are several categorical understand about entropy by many people, such as Baez, Leinster, ...    Here I give a different perspective.<br>\nOf course, this is just the first step to this new approach. </p>\n<p>If you have any suggestions or comments, please tell me.<br>\nThanks.</p>\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\nXuexing Lu</p>",

Bradley 's bolg is very helpful .   But I don't know yet how to understand the relationship between them. There are still many things that are unclear now.</p>",
