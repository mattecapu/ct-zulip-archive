As Thorsten explains, STLC is the language of cartesian closed categories, so <em>any presentation</em> of the language, so long as it has the correct universal property, is a model of the language. Models can differ in lats of ways, and I personally tried at least five approaches to syntax while doing my project. Jon refers to theorems about a specific presentation of a language as a <em>Subjective</em> theorems, and theorems that are true of any model of syntax as <em>Objective</em> theorems.</p>\n<p>One of Jon's key points is that normalisation is generally an objective property.
