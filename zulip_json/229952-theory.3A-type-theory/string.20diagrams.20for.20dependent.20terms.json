I don't think there's one good source that contains all the relevant aspects. A starting point would be §6 of Pitts's <a href=\"https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~amp12/papers/catl/catl.pdf\">Categorical logic</a>. Jacobs's <a href=\"https://people.mpi-sws.org/~dreyer/courses/catlogic/jacobs.pdf\">Categorical Logic and Type Theory</a> is a good introduction to dependent type theory from a slightly different perspective: that of fibred categories.</p>",
