        "content": "<p>Hi all. I am reading about the Steenrod squaring operations today. One of the applications of this idea is as follows. If X is a space, and C(X) denotes the chain complex of singular simplices in X,  then there is a natural map T: C(X) -&gt; C(X) \\otimes C(X) called the Alexander-Whitney map. We can prove that this is the unique natural map up to homotopy. In particular, we can show that (letting tau denote the symmetry isomorphism in the category of chain complexes)   T \\simeq \\tau T, so this map is co-commutative up to homotopy by some h_0 : T \\simeq \\tau T. Furthermore it is known that h_0 is homotopic to \\tau h_0 by some higher homotopy h_1, and inductively there exists h_{n+1} : h_n\\simeq \\tau h_n for each n.</p>\n<p>The Steenrod squares are certain algebraic invariants in cohomology derived from these higher homotopies. The fact that there are nonzero Steenrod squares shows that these higher homotopies cannot always be the constant homotopy at a point; in particular, we cannot give a natural map  f: C(X) -&gt; C(X)\\otimes C(X)   such that \\tau f = f on the nose, because if this were the case then we could always have h_n be the constant homotopy for all n.</p>\n<p>My question is how could we state this or express it in homotopy type theory? Intuitively I want to say something like \"there is no natural map f: C(X) -&gt; C(X) \\otimes C(X) such that   tau f = f by the reflexivity proof\" but this seems like nonsense. What is being shown is something like that tau f is not definitionally equal or rewrite equal to f in general even though the identity type f = tau f is contractible (?). But we cannot say in HoTT that \"A is not definitionally equal to B.\"</p>",
