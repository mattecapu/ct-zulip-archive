Or as an author  to only submit to conferences that have these low acceptance rates.  I know some people do this (in my narrower area it is more prevalent among people based in the US) but I totally disagree with this attitude.  <br>\nI just want to hang out at conferences where I know the PC has done a proper job selecting an interesting program, has made sure that the papers that are published in the proceedings are reliable as sources of scientific knowledge for the readers, where I know that the participants (in general) are genuinely interested in what they themselves and their peers are doing - rather than playing some endless prestige game where you are never satisfied with the \"fame\" you already earned.</p>",

This will not necessarily happen. But it may be that there is a lot of perceived higher quality work on the purer side, and some perceived lower quality work on the more applied side. (It <em>may</em> be that this is already the case.) In this situation my controversial opinion is that the role of ACT should be to shape the direction of the community by giving space to the more applied things at the expense of purer things.</p>",
