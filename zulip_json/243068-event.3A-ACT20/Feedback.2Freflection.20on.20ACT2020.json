For me, the talks were great, but the more informal parts of the conference lacked the richness of being in person together. Coordinating across timezones was a bit difficult too. But I think overall the upsides in terms of environmental and financial cost, time, and inclusivity for online conferences are huge, and I hope we'll be able to improve over time, and hold online events regularly.</p>",

I made a lot of friends at ACT2019 and didn't make as many new friends this year. The 2d map app where you could hear people virtually standing next to you was a cool idea and I would appreciate having spent more time in there with the critical mass of participants also hanging out in there.</p>\n<p>If we have ACT2021 in person, it would be cool to experiment with recording and watching the talks ahead of time and then using more of the time for meetings. Maybe the conference could be shorter and more like a workshop where the goal is interaction and collaboration rather than information broadcasting. I would rather spend 3 days collaborating than 5 days attending talks with a little collaboration in between.</p>",

If ACT is the \"main conference\" in our research field then it's more than natural to have quite a lot of presentations...</p>",
