        "content": "<p>I think the next thing that is needed to do anything useful is to talk about <em>playing games</em>, which the original definition of open games isn't able to do. <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"277554\">@Toby Smithe</span> discussed a general framework for this in his talk. If you can do this, it should be able to connect to existing work on game theory and pragmatics, language evolution etc.  One thing you can do that I'm thinking about heavily, and which <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"281203\">@Elena Di Lavore</span> is starting to work on, is this: If you have a (classical) repeated game, you can <em>pretend</em> that it's a Markov game by assuming that your agents have bounded memory. Markov games can be solved efficiently by dynamic programming methods, and that gives a way to get \"pragmatic\" approximate solutions to the original classical game. And to my understanding, the \"theory of play\" corresponding to Markov games is precisely what is called reinforcement learning. This is something that can be described using the machinery that already exists in open games: it's optics all the way down</p>",

        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"275901\">@Jules Hedges</span>  We used the old definition of open games for simplicity. But I agree that the more recent definitions in terms of optics  would be useful, especially if you want to model some stochastic games (such as the one for word-sense disambiguation I mentioned in my last slide).  Also it would be interesting to understand how you can go from an open game to an open learner, replacing the best-response function (which is not pragmatic) with a _better_ response. The concept of Nash equilibrium is still useful because it tells us where the game goes asymptotically.</p>",
