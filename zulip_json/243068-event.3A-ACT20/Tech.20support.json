If you search for most any article on TAC or Compositionality on Google scholar, the main hit will be the corresponding arXiv version, but if you then click on \"All [n] versions\", you'll see a list of other links, including the TAC or Compositionality one.  </p>\n<p>If you search for something on TAC which <em>doesn't</em> have an arXiv version (eg., search for the recent TAC article \"Cubical model categories and quasi-categories\"), then the TAC link does appear right away.  (I think all the Compositionality articles so far have corresponding arXiv versions, so it isn't possible to find a similar example there, as the arXiv link always seems to take precedence).</p>\n<p>So, as far as I can see, these articles are being indexed, they're just slightly hidden by the way Google scholar is setup.  I don't really know what to do about this - I think many other journal links suffer a similar fate on Google scholar (I guess because Google ranks arxiv links more highly).  Maybe I'll see if I can contact Google directly, though, to see if anything can be done (though I have my doubts they'll do much, as I'm sure they like keeping the eminence of their search algorithm).</p>",

My pointing out comes from my personal frustration with trying to find where 'Categories in Control' was published which was much harder than it should have been. If TAC implements this <a href=\"https://scholar.google.co.uk/intl/en/scholar/inclusion.html\">https://scholar.google.co.uk/intl/en/scholar/inclusion.html</a> it should be considered a proper journal by Google.

I'm still a bit puzzled, though - how can one tell that Google doesn't consider TAC (or Compositionality), a \"proper journal\"?</p>\n<p>I ask because as far as I can see, TAC (and Compositionality, and Higher Strucures, and the Electronic Journal of Combinatorics, and a number of other small independent journals I looked up) <em>do</em> meet the guidelines you link to on <a href=\"https://scholar.google.co.uk/intl/en/scholar/inclusion.html\">https://scholar.google.co.uk/intl/en/scholar/inclusion.html</a>.  Most do this via meta tags, but TAC meets the guidelines described on <a href=\"https://scholar.google.co.uk/intl/en/scholar/inclusion.html#indexing\">https://scholar.google.co.uk/intl/en/scholar/inclusion.html#indexing</a> for \"Indexing of content without the meta tags\".  In all cases, though, the result seems the same: their articles appear on Google scholar, but rarely as the first hit - instead, almost always after the relevant arXiv versions.  </p>\n<p>Conversely, journals hosted at large sites like <a href=\"http://sciencedirect.com\">sciencedirect.com</a> or <a href=\"http://ams.org\">ams.org</a> seem to get their articles linked first on a google search - but I suspect that's because of the size of the site they are on, rather than anything technically different they are doing.  For example, I've tried looking through the .html sources of an article on <a href=\"http://sciencedirect.com\">sciencedirect.com</a> (eg., view-source:<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001870819305122\">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001870819305122</a>) vs. an article on Compositionality (eg., view-source:<a href=\"https://compositionality-journal.org/papers/compositionality-1-4/\">https://compositionality-journal.org/papers/compositionality-1-4/</a>) and both seem to have the same sort of meta data that google scholar looks at; however, the one at sciencedirect is listed first in a search while the one at Compositionality is not.  Do you know of anything technically different these sites are doing?</p>",
