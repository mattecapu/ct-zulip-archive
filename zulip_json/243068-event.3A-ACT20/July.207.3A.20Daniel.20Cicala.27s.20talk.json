It's great to have a general formalism for rewriting that covers lots of useful open systems. For my own benefit and others', the relevant paper looks to be <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09029\">arXiv:2001.09029</a> and the PhD thesis is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05443\">arXiv:1906.05443</a>. If there any other resources I should know about, please tell me.</p>",
