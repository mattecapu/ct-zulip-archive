Out of interest did you see Gordon Plotkin's recent paper <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06415\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06415</a> ? He gives an equational presentation of partial differentiation that is Hilbert-Post complete: there can be no other equations without inconsistency. Quite a strong and impressive result, I think. His presentation looks a bit like differential categories. If you've seen it, I wonder if you've thought about what it means for your categorical models.</p>",

As we've seen in this talk, automatic differentation can be interpreted via (Cartesian reverse) differential categories.   Similarly, could automatic integration be interpreted via integral categories?  Without knowing the details of automatic integration, I don't know if this actually makes any sense, but thought I'd mention the possible connection to you both.</p>\n<div class=\"inline-preview-twitter\"><div class=\"twitter-tweet\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/_julesh_/status/1232997000561463299\"><img class=\"twitter-avatar\" src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/972424350736486401/RyVTQIgf_normal.jpg\"></a><p>Just realised that one of the things I've been talking about this week can be summarised as:\n\nLike backpropagation, but for integration rather than differentiation</p><span>- julesh (@_julesh_)</span></div></div>",

(Cf. my UCR seminar where I proposed that optics are precisely a categorical axiomatisation of \"things that look like the chain rule\"). The jump from that to this is the (significant minority) view that \"integration\" and \"bayesian inference\" are different terms for the same thing</p>",
