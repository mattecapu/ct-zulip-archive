This is the complete definition one could end up using: <a href=\"https://github.com/mroman42/vitrea/blob/8aed32a88dfc1df28460896a1a7f51166ed67dc7/source/Tambara.hs#L74\">https://github.com/mroman42/vitrea/blob/8aed32a88dfc1df28460896a1a7f51166ed67dc7/source/Tambara.hs#L74</a> I tried to simplify it on the slides, but, as you observe, the complete definition only makes sense when the parameters are passed to the Tambara. Thank you for the question!</p>",

I have changed over time the direction in which I write the category. I think the argument on the other side was to match the order p(a,b) -&gt; p(s,t); but as you say, it is a bit counterintuitive (I guess one needs to make some choice there).</p>",

        "content": "<p>Perhaps this is related to separation of the \"abstract view\" of the lens (=no internal details visible) and the \"concrete view\" (=scary details of proofs visible). I mean in Haskell, newtype Lens a b s t = Lens (forall p. (...) =&gt; p a b -&gt; p s t). The constructor would force separating the two views. Then you know what is \"internal to lens\" (anything that pattern matches or invokes Lens constructor) and what is \"interface\" (e.g. composing two lenses is interface). At least I felt I had to open the definition of Lens \"abstraction\" in order to understand what was happening in the composition.</p>",
