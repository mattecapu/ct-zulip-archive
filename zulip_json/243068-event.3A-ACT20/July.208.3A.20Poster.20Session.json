        "content": "<p>Hi everyone, I'm a newcomer to the applied category theory community! :) I'm<br>\ncoming from a pure math / theoretical computer science / machine learning<br>\nbackground, and I will be presenting a paper titled \"Towards an algebraic model<br>\nof data science workflows\" as part of the poster session. </p>\n<p>The paper's focus is not on proving new theorems (as much fun as it is), but<br>\nrather on an examination of a variety of technologies enabling data science<br>\napplications, and the design objectives and constraints behind them. As someone<br>\npracticing ML engineering, I believe that the friction between these<br>\ntechnologies is a major source of programmer inefficiency. To this end, the<br>\npaper proposes ways in which this friction can be reduced by a unifying model<br>\nquite close in spirit to the functorial model of data and ontology logs. I am<br>\ncurrently planning an open-source implementation of such a model.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the version of the paper submitted originally to ACT2020 was...<br>\nless than understandable :) and some key definitions were misinterpreted in the<br>\nreview process. However, the new version has many more clarifications, examples,<br>\nand figures (it also ended up being substantially longer). If any of this sounds<br>\ninteresting, feel free to get in touch with me here or at <a href=\"mailto:amakelov@mit.edu\">amakelov@mit.edu</a>. And<br>\nfinally, here is the paper: <a href=\"https://amakelov.github.io/data/act2020/paper.pdf\">https://amakelov.github.io/data/act2020/paper.pdf</a>.</p>",
