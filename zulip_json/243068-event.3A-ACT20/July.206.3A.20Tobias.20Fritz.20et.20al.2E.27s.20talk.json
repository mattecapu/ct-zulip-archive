        "content": "<p>In this talk, I will be speaking about a project tentatively titled:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/765ukbwtdgm23oe/blackwell_act.pdf\">Distribution functors, second-order stochastic dominance and the Blackwell--Sherman--Stein Theorem in Categorical Probability</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is a work in collaboration with Tobias Fritz, Paolo Perrone, and Eigil Rischel; in which we study what can one do with Markov categories that have <em>distribution objects</em>, which one can think of as spaces of measures. With this kind of structure, we can prove abstract versions of results such as:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The equivalence between the existence of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.06037.pdf\">partial evaluations</a> between two measures and the second-order stochastic dominance relation of the two measures. The latter is a common way to compare measures in terms of how \"spread out\" they are and the former is the lowest level of the <a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/bar+construction\">bar construction</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Blackwell-Sherman-Stein Theorem. This result characterizes the \"informativeness\" order relation of statistical models defined in terms of the existence of a simulation of one from the other. In particular, it shows that this relation is isomorphic to the second-order stochastic dominance relation of measures over the <em>space of posterior distributions over the tested hypotheses</em> that a Bayesian agent would assign having performed the statistical experiment. That is, a statistical experiment is more informative iff the posteriors are more spread out (so that doing the experiment allows one to distinguish between the hypotheses better), in a precise sense that we can now make use of in any suitable Markov category.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Apart from generalizing some known results from mathematical statistics, we also advance the theoretical understanding of Markov categories relevant to these concepts. Specifically, we elucidate the relation between Markov categories and monoidal monads - showing under what conditions can we think of a Markov category as the Kleisli category of a probability monad (and vice versa).</p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_ref\"><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/765ukbwtdgm23oe/blackwell_act.pdf\" title=\"blackwell_act.pdf\"><img src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/static/images/spectrum-icons/generated/content/content-pdf-large.png\"></a><div><div class=\"message_inline_image_title\">blackwell_act.pdf</div><desc class=\"message_inline_image_desc\"></desc></div></div>",
