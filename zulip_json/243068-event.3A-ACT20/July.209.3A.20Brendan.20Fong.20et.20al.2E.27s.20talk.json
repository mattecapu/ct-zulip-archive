        "content": "<p>thinking a bit more since the talk, I do understand <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"319786\">@Tarmo Uustalu</span>  suggestion, but I don't think  like v. much the approach. When you go for labelled systems like Alex's, which indeed form a nice framework in geometric logic, you lose some of the properties that made you want to do Curry-Howard for modal logic to begin with. In particular I think to this day we don't have a proof of decidability of IS4. (though I may be wrong as I last thought about it in 2005?). the point is that constructive modal logics are a bit of a open-ended project, as we don't know exactly the theorems we think should be true. We know (as Alex points out) a collection of requirements on the set of  theorems, they shouldn't make diamonds defined in terms of  boxes, the system should be conservative over the basis, we hope to have existence and disjunction properties, etc but a fundamental question is whether diamonds should distribute over disjunctions or not. Prawitz' system does not satisfy it, the Simpson system does.</p>",

Simpson system satisfies distribution of diamond over disjunction, Prawitz CS4 does not. these are facts in propositional modal logic, if you're doing your calculations over a topos (higher-order logic) maybe the calculations need to be adjusted,  I believe  in this case a new proof might be required, but I don't know much. (glad to see that I  found the right place to write this in!)</p>",
