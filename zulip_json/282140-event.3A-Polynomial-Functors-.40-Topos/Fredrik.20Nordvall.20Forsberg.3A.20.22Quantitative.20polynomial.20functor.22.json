        "content": "<p><em>Abstract:</em><br>\nQuantitative Type Theory combines linear types (where we keep track of how many times a variable is used) and dependent types (where we can keep track of properties of terms using types). This gives a logical system which is both expressive and precise with respect to the resource usage of programs and proofs, with a rich model theory. I will talk about data types in this setting, in the form of \"resource-aware\" polynomial functors and their initial algebras, and how \"quantitative\" induction can be derived from initiality. This is joint work with Georgi Nakov.</p>",
