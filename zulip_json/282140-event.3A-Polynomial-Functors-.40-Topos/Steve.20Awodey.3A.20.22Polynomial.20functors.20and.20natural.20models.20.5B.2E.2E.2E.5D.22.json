        "content": "<p><em>Abstract:</em><br>\nDependent type theory is sometimes described categorically as a Category with Families (CwF). In [1], it was shown that the notion of a CwF can conveniently be reformulated as a so-called \"natural model\", which is simply a representable natural transformation p : U. → U over an arbitrary index category C of \"contexts\". Such a model of type theory admits dependent sums and a terminal type just if it is a (pseudo-)monad, when regarded as a polynomial endofunctor P : Ĉ → Ĉ on the category of presheaves on C. Moreover, dependent products correspond to a P-algebra structure. The logical Propositions-as-Types conception is then modelled by a retraction of polynomial monads relating the type theoretic and the topos-theoretic interpretations of predicate logic.<br>\n[1] Awodey, S., Natural models of homotopy type theory, Math.
