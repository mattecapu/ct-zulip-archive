Such \"polynomial\" monads can be considered in more general settings, and I will explain how polynomial monads on presheaf infinity-categories are closely related (through an infinity-categorical version of Weber's Nerve Theorem) to monads describing homotopy-coherent algebraic structures defined in terms of \"Segal conditions\". This is joint work with Hongyi Chu.</p>",
