We do have a list of 300 registered participants, but not their affiliations. And I don't know if it would be correct to publish it. It would also not be completely faithful, because in practice we are only around 100 participants (150 at the peak so far). Not sure what to do...<br>\nCheers, Joachim.</p>",
