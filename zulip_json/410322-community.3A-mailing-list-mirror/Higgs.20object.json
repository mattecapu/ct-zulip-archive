As far<br>\nas I know, Denis never wrote it down. When I saw the result mentioned<br>\nin Volger's 1975 paper, it occurred to me that someone ought to<br>\nwork out an explicit description of the automorphism group; this may<br>\nwell have been known to Higgs, but I didn't get it from either Wraith<br>\nor Volger. I also described the internal object of automorphisms, so<br>\nI could be credited with having invented the Higgs object. But it was<br>\nPeter Freyd who gave it that name, when he realized it played an<br>\nimportant role in his work on choice and well-ordering; it's possible<br>\nthat Peter had evidence that Denis had in fact defined it, but I<br>\nnever saw it.</p>\n<p>Best regards,<br>\nPeter Johnstone</p>\n<p>On Oct 29 2023, Martin Escardo wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I got lots of private replies - thanks.</p>\n<p>The most informative one was that Hugo Volger published in 1975 a paper<br>\nthat includes \"Higgs involution theorem\", namely that any embedding of<br>\n\\Omega into itself is an involution (and hence an isomorphism).</p>\n<p>(1) Hugo Volger. \"Ultrafilters, ultrapowers and finiteness in a topos\".<br>\nJournal of Pure and Applied Algebra 6 (1975) 345-356</p>\n<p>(2) Then there is Johnstone's paper \"Automorphisms of \\Omega\".
