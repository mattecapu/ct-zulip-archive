He writes “The<br>\nfrequent but unfortunate use of the word ‘triple’ in this sense has<br>\nachieved a maximum of needless confusion, what with the conflict with<br>\nordered triple, plus the use of associated terms such as ‘triple derived<br>\nfunctors’ for functors which are not three times derived from anything<br>\nin the world. Hence the term ‘monad’.” One reason I like this passage is<br>\nthat it is a beautiful illustration of the vividness of his writing, his<br>\nsheer verve. Another is that it is so characteristic of his manner of<br>\narguing a point. But the third is personal. In the first draft he used<br>\nthe word triple, and I won him over. I had just defined operads, and I<br>\nhad coined that word to go well with monad.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>You're receiving this message because you're a member of the Categories mailing list group from Macquarie University.</p>\n<p>Leave group:<br>\n<a href=\"https://outlook.office365.com/owa/categories@mq.edu.au/groupsubscription.ashx?source=EscalatedMessage&amp;action=leave&amp;GuestId=7d1df94c-5953-42b8-9208-4e4b5067c2dc\">https://outlook.office365.com/owa/categories@mq.edu.au/groupsubscription.ashx?source=EscalatedMessage&amp;action=leave&amp;GuestId=7d1df94c-5953-42b8-9208-4e4b5067c2dc</a></p>",
