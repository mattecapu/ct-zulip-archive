The city of Sheffield is one of the major cities in the UK, yet 60% of it is green space. It’s a city that’s safe, affordable, creative and welcoming. Living here, one gets a vibrant big city feel as well as the space and adventure of the Peak District National Park which is (almost) on the doorstep:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/sheffield-guide/quick-guide&lt;https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/2m44C3QNl1S3PLJJuqJbf0?domain=sheffield.ac.uk\">https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/sheffield-guide/quick-guide&lt;https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/2m44C3QNl1S3PLJJuqJbf0?domain=sheffield.ac.uk</a>&gt;</p>\n<p>The PhD positions are fully funded and also come with travel funding. We are looking for motivated students preferably with experience in one or more of the following topics: discrete mathematics, linear algebra, probability theory, and fundamentals of theoretical computer science, including algorithms, complexity, and logic.</p>\n<p>Specific research areas that the group has expertise in include:</p>\n<p>*   Algorithms (incl. efficient, parameterised, approximation, randomised, linear programs, streaming, dynamic, and data structures)</p>\n<p>*   Computational complexity (incl. parameterised complexity, hardness of approximation, average-case complexity, fine-grained complexity)</p>\n<p>*   Logics in CS (incl. finite model theory, descriptive complexity, semantics &amp; category theory, quantitative &amp; probabilistic, temporal &amp; modal, logic of random structures)</p>\n<p>*   Graph theory &amp; finite combinatorics</p>\n<p>The PhD positions will be supervised by the following member of the FOX group:</p>\n<p>Dr. Harsh Beohar is broadly interested in comparative concurrency semantics and in the interplay of category theory, logic, and semantics. Current topics include expressive modal logics, behavioural equivalence games, synthesising distinguishing/characteristic formulae all at the level of coalgebras.

A further emerging topic is to study foundations of neural networks using the machinery of logics and complexity theory related to numerical data.
