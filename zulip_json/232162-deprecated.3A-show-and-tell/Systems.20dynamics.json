For example, there's a technique called \"loop analysis\" in ecology that's about finding necessary and sufficient conditions for the fixed point to be stable when all you have is that kind of data. (I suspect the book will cover a little of that kind of thing.)</p>",

Expanding on this, for each fixed diagram shape the forgetful functor(s) factor through intermediate forgetful functors that forget parts of the information, indexed by subdiagrams.<br>\nA general information-optimization question is \"which of these forgetful functors have adjoints\"? That is: when can we recover an extreme, but valid, extension of a reduced data set to a larger data set on a diagram? More generally, when does there exist <em>any</em> extension of a given dataset, and is there anything we can infer with certainty about every possible solution from the information we have?<br>\nI anticipate that the recently developed <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00420\" title=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00420\">Behavioral Mereology</a> of <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"276053\">@Brendan Fong</span>, Myers and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"276049\">@David Spivak</span> will find practical applications here, since it provides a framework for reasoning about exactly this kind of restriction/extension problem.<br>\nThe \"indexed by subdiagrams\" aspect makes me suspect that <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"276917\">@Andrew Pitts</span>' tripos theory might deserve a place at the table, but I don't know enough about the scope of this theory to give a confident estimate of its potential contribution.</p>",
