The simple verb 'cerno' means 'decide/distinguish', and is cognate with Greek κρίνω, from which comes English 'critic', 'crisis', etc. Other compounds and cognates of 'cerno' have come into English, such as 'decree' (from the supine stem 'decretum' of the compound verb 'de-cerno'), and 'concern' (from post-classical 'con-cerno'), also 'crime' and 'discriminate' (both from the derived noun 'crimen'). For a category theory connection, apparently French 'crible' (= sieve) also comes from the same root.</p>",
