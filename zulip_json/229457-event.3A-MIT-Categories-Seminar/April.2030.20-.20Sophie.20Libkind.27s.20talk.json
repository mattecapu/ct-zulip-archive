        "content": "<p>a half answer to DJMs question as to whether generators exist: maybe, if you're willing to assume the law of mass action. It's a (chemistry) thing that's tantamount to the physical assumption that you're dealing with a large number of well-mixed reactants bumping into each other uniformly randomly, such that the relative rate of any reaction [A + B -&gt; C] as a positive real number is proportional to [amount of A x amount of B]. e.g. if there's only one reaction [A + A -&gt; B], then doubling the amount of A, one expects a fourfold increase in the rate of reaction, because there are four times as many \"A meets A\" events. The upshot of assuming LMA is then that you can lift directly from the input-output types of the bubbles to polynomials, by mapping the tensor monoid of the inputs into the monoid of polynomials over your state variables with multiplication, and mapping the monoid of outputs to monoid of polynomials over state variables with addition, both maps identity-on-state-variables. Though one only gets out polynomial ordinary differential equations in this way, it's possible to recover things like the Hill equation and the qualitative effects of inhibition and catalysis, so it's \"good enough\" to do biological modelling.</p>",

In 'biochem' dynamical systems, we want all the bubbles to be freely connected: all typematching inputs and outputs are connected, and all typematching (on state variables) open ports are connected, because each atomic process is concurrent with all the rest. Would be nice if assuming all connections were free in this way forces the kind of semiring (as above) that characterises LMA</p>",
