It is already a privilege to be able to assist from a distance.<br>\nWhen pushing a bit for zoom, I admit I am also thinking of myself as a speaker in a few weeks time. I think it would be great at least to be able to see a few faces in the audience. I think John said something like that too, in the minutes before his talk yesterday. But also as a participant: yesterday it was a nice experience to greet some other participants, like you would in a real talk. It was nice to hear questions in real time, and see the face of the person asking them.<br>\nThanks again for making all this possible. Also to Christian and Joe in Riverside.</p>",
