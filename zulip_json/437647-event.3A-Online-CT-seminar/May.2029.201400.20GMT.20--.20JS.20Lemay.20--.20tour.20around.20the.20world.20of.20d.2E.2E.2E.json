In this talk, I will provide a tour on the world of the differential categories. We will visit the four chapters of differential categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Differential categories, which axiomatize the algebraic foundations of differentiation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cartesian differential categories, which axiomatize differential calculus over Euclidean spaces.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Differential restriction categories, which axiomatize differential calculus over open spaces.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tangent categories, which axiomatize differential calculus over smooth manifolds.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will talk about the famous \"map of differential categories\", and also the history and applications of differential categories.<br>\n\"\"\"</p>",

I am less familiar with Carboni's notion of bicategory of partials maps, but my understanding and recollection is that restriction categories are more general and I believe give rise to a Carboni's notion of a bicategory of partial maps. However I'm not 100% familiar with the exact connection. Restriction categories I, II, and III do reference Carboni and Carboni-Walters papers, so a deeper explanation might be found there.

There are various notions of categories with some kind of partiality, and there is a nice story to tell connecting some of them. I don't know the full picture.</p>\n<p>The notion of products present in Cartesian categories can be generalised in several ways such that different universal properties hold.  A Cartesian bicategory is the Span-like generalisation (which I won't discuss, because it isn't poset enriched, unlike the others); a Cartesian bicategory of relations is the \"Rel-like\" nondeterministic version; a discrete Cartesian restriction category is the partial version; and a discrete inverse category is the partially invertible version.</p>\n<p>Take a Cartesian bicategory of relations, which is equipped with a distinguished extraspecial Frobenius algebra on each object, compatible with the tensor product.  Then as a matter of notation, to avoid confusion, by comonoid, monoid, Frobenius algebra, multiplication, comultiplication etc., I mean those coming from the Cartesian bicategory of relations structure.  By asking that maps be strictly/laxly/oplaxly natural with respect to the different components of the Frobenius algebras, you get these different weakenings of a Cartesian bicategory of relations.</p>\n<p>The subcategory of comonoid homorphisms is Cartesian, the subcategory of comultiplication homorphisms is a discrete Cartesian restriction category, and the category of semi-Frobenius (non unital, non counital Frobenius algebra) homomorphisms is a discrete inverse category.</p>\n<p>One part of this correspondence extends to an equivalence of categories between the category of discrete inverse categories and the category of discrete Cartesian restriction categories.  This is witnessed on objects, on the one hand, by sending a discrete Cartesian restriction category to its subcategory of semi-Frobenius homorphisms; and on the other hand, by freely adding counits to the comultiplication (non counital comonoid) structure of a discrete inverse  category.</p>\n<p>I would have liked to have shown that there is also an equivalence between the category of discrete Cartesian restriction categories and the category of Cartesian bicategories of relations: on the one hand, by looking at comultiplication homomorphisms of Cartesian bicategory of relations; and on the other by taking a discrete Cartesian restriction category and freely adding units to the multiplications (non unital monoid) such that they are also made to be sections of the counits.  However, I have a feeling that this is false in general, and it seems that ones into trouble with certain non-split idempotents. If my suspicion is correct, then Cartesian bicategories of relations would be strictly less expressive than discrete Cartesian restriction categories.</p>",

There are various notions of categories with some kind of partiality, and there is a nice story to tell connecting some of them. I don't know the full picture.</p>\n<p>The notion of products present in Cartesian categories can be generalised in several ways such that different universal properties hold.  A Cartesian bicategory is the Span-like generalisation (which I won't discuss, because it isn't poset enriched, unlike the others); a Cartesian bicategory of relations is the \"Rel-like\" nondeterministic version; a discrete Cartesian restriction category is the partial version; and a discrete inverse category is the partially invertible version.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thank you for the fantastic overview of these fantastic beasts! I just wanted to comment on your side-point here and add to the overall picture: a Cartesian bicategory - not necessarily <em>of relations</em> - in the sense of Carboni &amp; Walters' <a href=\"https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82513341.pdf\">Cartesian Bicategories I</a> is still poset-enriched if I'm not mistaken. Without going to the non-locally posetal bicategory of Spans (that's in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/0708.1921\">Cartesian Bicategories II</a> iirc), there are interesting examples of such categories, where the diagonal and projections have right adjoints, but together these do <em>not</em> form a Frobenius algebra. One paradigmatic examples is the category of Boolean-enriched profunctors aka monotone relations (aka weakening relations, aka...? It has many names in the literature since various people have rediscovered its use independently): its objects are (pre-)ordered sets and morphisms are relations that preserve the order in a certain sense. In this category, the objects for which the structure maps do form a Frobenius algebra are precisely those whose order relation is equality, <em>i.e.</em>, sets! So Rel (the category of ordinary relations) lives inside of it, but arbitrary objects need not be discrete in the sense of Carboni &amp; Walters. It is still compact closed however, and the dual of an object <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>X</mi><mo separator=\"true\">,</mo><mo>⪯</mo><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">(X,\\preceq)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mopen\">(</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.07847em;\">X</span><span class=\"mpunct\">,</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">⪯</span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mclose\">)</span></span></span></span> is not itself, but <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>X</mi><mo separator=\"true\">,</mo><mo>⪰</mo><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">(X,\\succeq)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mopen\">(</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.07847em;\">X</span><span class=\"mpunct\">,</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">⪰</span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mclose\">)</span></span></span></span>, the same set equipped with the opposite order relation.</p>",
