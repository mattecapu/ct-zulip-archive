These notions are not disjoint; in fact, they constitute a hierarchy, with some subsuming others. Curiously, the literature appears completely silent on strict bilimits, despite the fact that they are the most general one among those notions. Instead, authors discuss strict limits and (pseudo)bilimits, which are the two apex notions when strict bilimits are not considered. This leads to the question of whether strict bilimits are a superfluous notion. I'll describe an elementary construction that produces examples of a 2-category that has strict biequalisers but not strict equalisers. Since bilimits don't admit strict biequalisers, this confirms that strict bilimits are not subsumed by bilimits and strict limits.</p>\n<p>The talk will in large part be an introduction to limit notions in 2-categories, with an emphasis on the organisational aspects, and will assume no prior knowledge. The underlying materials are <a href=\"https://sorilee.github.io/posts/2023/strict-bilimit-and-its-proper-examples/\">available here</a></p>\n<p>See you then!</p>",
