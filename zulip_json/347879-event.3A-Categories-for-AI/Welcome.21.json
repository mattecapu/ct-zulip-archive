This stream is meant for discussions about theory, practice and ideas about all things concerning Category Theory and Deep Learning. Inside this stream there will be various <em>topics</em> for discussion - feel free to have a look around, and chat with your fellow course participants.</p>\n<p>On the left side you might notice that there is another stream titled \"general: welcome\". This is the introduction stream for the entire Applied Category Theory community, and the only other one you're currently subscribed to. We suggest you have a look at it, since it includes much more information about functionality of Zulip, and suggestions on how to get around. Importantly, it also includes community rules and guidelines - make sure you read and adhere to them.<br>\nLooking around on this Zulip you will find many  Category Theory conversations! Don't worry about if some of them seem foreign (they certainly will!). The course we're running here is meant to teach you what these things are, and give you a sense of how to proceed learning CT on your own.</p>\n<p>So please, do feel free to have a look around, and give me or  any members of the organising team (<span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"543731\">@Petar Veličković</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"393406\">@joaogui1 (he/him)</span> , <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"281702\">@Pim</span>) a shout if you need any help.</p>",
