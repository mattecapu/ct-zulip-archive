Indeed, at any given moment they provide a function A--&gt;B, and given any input from A and loss signal on B, they do two things: provide an updated function A--&gt;B and backpropagate a loss signal on A. Populations of neurons, which we called \"Learners\", can be put together in series or in parallel, forming a symmetric monoidal category. However, ANNs satisfy an additional property: there is a consistent method by which the functions update and errors backpropagate; namely, they all use gradient descent. The chain rule implies that the composite of gradient descenders is again a gradient descender.<br>\nIn this talk I will discuss a generalization called \"dynamic organizational systems\", which includes ANNs, prediction markets, Hebbian learning, and strategic games. It is founded on the category Poly of polynomial functors, which generalizes Lens. I will review the relevant background on Poly and then explain dynamic organizational systems as coherent procedures by which a network of component systems can rewire its network structure in response to the data flowing through it. I'll explain the ANN case, and possibly the prediction market case, time permitting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This lecture will happen at 5PM UK time, instead of 4PM as we've had it usually for Cats4AI.</p>",
