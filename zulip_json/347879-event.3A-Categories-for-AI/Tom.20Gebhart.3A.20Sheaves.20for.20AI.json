In order to properly learn representations of such systems, a machine learning algorithm must have the capacity to faithfully model these local interactions while also ensuring the resulting representations fuse properly into a consistent whole. In this talk, we will see that cellular sheaf theory offers an ideal algebro-topological framework for both reasoning about and implementing machine learning models on data which are subject to such local-to-global constraints over a topological space. We will introduce cellular sheaves from a categorical perspective before turning to a discussion of sheaf (co)homology as a semi-computable tool for implementing these categorical concepts. Finally, we will observe two practical applications of these ideas in the form of sheaf neural networks, a generalization of graph neural networks for processing sheaf-valued signals; and knowledge sheaves, a sheaf-theoretic reformulation of knowledge graph embedding. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The lecture will happen at the usual  time (4pm UK timezone). </p>\n<p>See you there!</p>",
