In this talk, we'll see that category theory can provide a natural framework for investigating this passage from texts—and probability distributions on them—to a more semantically meaningful space. To motivate the mathematics involved, we will open with a basic, yet curious, analogy between linear algebra and category theory. We will then define a category of expressions in language enriched over the unit interval and afterwards pass to enriched copresheaves on that category. We will see that the latter setting has rich mathematical structure and comes with ready-made tools to begin exploring that structure.</p>",
