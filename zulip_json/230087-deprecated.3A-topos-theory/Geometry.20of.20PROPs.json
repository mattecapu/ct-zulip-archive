Actually this construction works for a more general kind of model: Taking Lex completion and then presheaves is a left 2-adjoint from finite product cats to the 2-category of cocomplete and finitely complete categories, and colimit and finite limit preserving functors. Toposes also happen to live there and geometric morphisms have such functors as their left adjoint.<br>\nThe chain of adjunction isomorphisms now looks longer:<br>\nCocompleteFinLimCat(Psh(Lex(FP(YourPROP))), C)=FinLimCat(Lex(FP(YourPROP)), C) = FinProdCat( FP(YourPROP), C) =  SymMonCat( YourPROP , C) = Models of your PROP in C.</p>\n<p>If you want to allow models not only in categories with finite products but with more general symm. monoidal structures, but which are cocomplete, then you can pass to the symmetric monoidal cocompletion -  this is the category of presheaves with the Day convolution symm. monoidal structure. So it happens to be a topos, but now you don't place it in the world of toposes and geometric morphisms (and if you place it there it would classify something else, not models of your PROP).</p>\n<p>Nice picture, isn't it? So I guess to see your PROPs as something geometric you have to consider models in a world where you know how to see things geometrically (after passage to the opposite category, usually)</p>",
