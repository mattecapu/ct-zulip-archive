Categories of algebraic structures are rarely toposes.<br>\nFor the case of operad algebras in the category of Sets with the cartesian monoidal structure, the answer has been worked out in: Johnstone, When is a Variety a Topos? , Algebra Universalis 21 (1985) pp.198-212. Roughly the answer is: this can only happen if essentially all your operations are unary. The modifier \"essentially\" leaves a tiny bit of room: Roughly, you can allow operations of higher arity, if they amount to conditions on your algebras, and not giving extra structure. Better look at Johnstone's article yourself.</p>",
