The format is a little more formal than here, but there is more room for longer form contributions, such as <a href=\"https://aroundtoposes.com/forum/philosophical-discussion/learning-from-grothendieck/#post-10\">this post</a> I wrote this past week. It is also hoped that it will become a resource for folks <a href=\"https://aroundtoposes.com/forum/learning-resources/welcome-to-the-section-for-learners/#post-7\">learning topos thery</a> for the first time, although some input and learner questions are needed before that!</p>",
