Hence it may very well be the case that who wrote that on the nlab just noticed PCAs and their relative realizability topoi can be, in principle, constructed in every topos, without having done so themselves</p>",

        "content": "<p>I don’t know if it will help you but my MSc thesis is about something similar. In it I construct a category of “assemblies” for a Cartesian restriction functor, with the domain acting as a category of realisers, and the codomain acting like the ambient logical theory (being in the extreme case a partial topos). From this category of “assemblies” one can recover a topos by methods that rhyme with the usual ones, given enough structure in the domain and codomain of the aforementioned functor. The scare quotes are because I made a silly error and the “assemblies” would be better called “proto-assemblies”, since they do not carry the requirement that every element of the carrier be associated with at least one realizer.  I still haven’t gotten around to writing a readable version of any of this, but if you’re interested you can find it here: <a href=\"https://www.ioc.ee/~cneste/files/msc-thesis.pdf\">https://www.ioc.ee/~cneste/files/msc-thesis.pdf</a></p>",
