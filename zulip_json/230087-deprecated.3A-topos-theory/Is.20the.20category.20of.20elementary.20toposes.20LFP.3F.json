In fact, Freyd's \"Aspects of topoi\" more or less explicitly describes a finitary essentially algebraic theory of which elementary topoi in this sense (i.e., with chosen terminal object / pullbacks / subobject classifier or whatever the exact list) are the models.<br>\nIf one interprets the question in the more usual way as about categories with at least one terminal object and functors which preserve the property of being a terminal object, and if one is interested in the 1-category of such categories and functors, then the answer is no. In fact there is not even an initial category-with-terminal-object, because if we pick a category with at least two terminal objects, there cannot be exactly one terminal-object-preserving functor from any category-with-terminal-object to it.<br>\nIf however one considers the question to be about 2-categories or (2,1)-categories, then presumably the answer is yes again but one has to first understand what is meant by \"locally finitely presentable 2-category\".</p>",
