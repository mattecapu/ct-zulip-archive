Where can I find a discussion of \"elementary theories\" (a theory specified by the Mitchell-Bénabou language?) for elementary toposes? In particular, is there a proof in the literature that the category of models of an elementary theory is equivalent to some category of logical morphisms from the corresponding \"classifying elementary topos\"? My feeling is that the situation should be much less well-behaved for elementary topoi, due to the awkwardness of modelling exponentials and their contravariance.</p>",
