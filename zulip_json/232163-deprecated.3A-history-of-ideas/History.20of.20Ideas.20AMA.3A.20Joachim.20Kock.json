Enumerative geometry is the art of counting how many geometric objects (often curves) satisfy certain conditions. The enumerative geometry of rational curves goes back to Antiquity: given 2 points in the plane, there is 1 line (= degree-1 rational curve) that passes through them. Apollonius essentially showed that there is 1 conic (= degree-2 rational curve) that passes through 5 given points. In degree 3: Steiner (1848) computed that 12 rational plane cubics pass through 8 points, and finally, (the great Danish mathematician) Zeuthen (1873) computed the number 620 of rational plane quartics through 11 points.</p>\n<p>Then a century passed.</p>\n<p>With modern intersection theory à la Fulton (1980s), the results of Zeuthen could finally be verified to modern standards of rigour, and the next number: 87304 rational quintics through 14 points, was computed in 1993 by my thesis advisor Israel Vainsencher, as a byproduct of other investigations.</p>\n<p>Then in 1994, Kontsevich found a marvelous recursive formula solving the general case (of rational degree-d curves through 3d-1 points). The formula dropped out 'by accident' from ideas from string theory, and in particular the notion of quantum cohomology. Furthermore, the formula is an instance of the associative law for the product in the quantum cohomology ring! Could it be more beautiful?

At first it is a cute categorical version of some elementary algebra. Soon it becomes a general toolbox for substitution and induction, intimately related with dependent type theory. Very conveniently, Nicola Gambino came visiting in October, and he was already working with polynomial functors in connection with type theory. Then in November 2004 I moved to Barcelona.</p>\n<p>I think André was happy someone could take up the theory, and he invested some time in setting it in the right direction. He did not have time to develop it himself, as he was busy with the grand project of quasi-categories. I feel very privileged for having been there just at the right time.
