Looks like we're out of luck with PSSL 103. Google only found \"Masaryk University will host the 103rd edition of PSSL. We look forward to see you in Brno! all the relevant informations are on the conference website.\" but he conference website gives me a 404. I had more luck with PSSL 102, <a href=\"https://www.usc.es/regaca/pssl102/\">https://www.usc.es/regaca/pssl102/</a> Finally we get <a href=\"http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~pmtng/PSSL/pssl101.html\">http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~pmtng/PSSL/pssl101.html</a>.</p>",
