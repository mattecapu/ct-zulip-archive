I feel like explaining <em>why</em> I worked on recursivity in quantum mechanics.   When I was taking a course on general relativity I got really excited by John Wheeler's crazy ideas near the end of his ttextbook <em>Gravitation</em>.  One of them was the \"participatory universe\", the idea that the universe only exists because it has observers in it.  I dreamt of making this precise somehow so I started thinking about how complex a universe had to be to have life in it that was complex enough to understand the laws of that universe   I couldn't get far with that, but in the process I started thinking about whether time evolution in quantum mechanics was computable.  I reinvented a bunch of the theory of computable functions between metric spaces, and when I got a thesis advisor, John Burgess in the philosophy department, he said \"oh, you've reinvented a bunch of stuff, read <em>Descriptive Set Theory</em> by Moschovakis and use that.\"  So I did.</p>",

With the possible worlds interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, it even seemed to make QM quite intuitive.

But this was a fairly pedestrian form of category theory: abelian categories, and a bit of derived functors.  It was only much later, when I started understanding n-categories thanks to lots of conversations with James Dolan, that I really got <em>the point</em> about things like homological algebra: like, that chain complexes are strict stable infinity-groupoids, a very tractable sort of infinity-category.   Back then I just treated homological algebra the way most algebraists do, as some sort of computational framework.</p>",

The papers with Frenkel (apparently still not in their final form) describe the game plan and hint at marvelous things still to come. The conjecture is stated: \"a 4d TQFT can be reconstructed from a tensor 2-category\". This follows up on Crane's earlier work on getting 3d TQFTs from modular tensor categories (big example: the categories of representations of quantum groups at roots of unity). And the authors define the notion of a Hopf category, show how the category of module categories of a Hopf category is a tensor 2-category, and use \"categorification\" to turn the universal enveloping algebra of a quantum group into a Hopf category. Sound abstract? Indeed it is. But the aim is clear: to cook up 4d TQFTs from quantum groups. Such quantum field theories might be physically important; indeed, the one associated to SU(2) is likely to have a lot to do with quantum gravity.</p>\n<p>I am currently perusing Kapranov and Voevodsky's massive paper on 2-categories, which seems to be the starting point for Crane's above papers and also those of Carter/Saito that I mentioned last week.

What happened to me during these years, perhaps, can be compared most closely to what happened to Karl Jung in 1913-14. Jung called it “confrontation with the unconscious”. I do not know what to call it, but I can describe it in a few words. Remaining more or less normal, apart from the fact that I was trying to discuss what was happening to me with people whom I should not have discussed it with, I had in a few months acquired a very considerable experience of visions, voices, periods when parts of my body did not obey me, and a lot of incredible accidents. The most intense period was in mid-April 2007 when I spent 9 days (7 of them in the Mormon capital of Salt Lake City), never falling asleep for all these days.</p>\n<p>Almost from the very beginning, I found that many of these phenomena (voices, visions, various sensory hallucinations), I could control. So I was not scared and did not feel sick, but perceived everything as something very interesting, actively trying to interact with those “beings” in the auditorial, visual and then tactile spaces that appeared around me (by themselves or by invoking them). I must say, probably, to avoid possible speculations on this subject, that I did not use any drugs during this period, tried to eat and sleep a lot, and drank diluted white wine.</p>\n<p>Another comment: when I say “beings”, naturally I mean what in modern terminology are called complex hallucinations. The word “beings” emphasizes that these hallucinations themselves “behaved”, possessed a memory independent of my memory, and reacted to attempts at communication. In addition, they were often perceived in concert in various sensory modalities. For example, I played several times with a (hallucinated) ball with a (hallucinated) girl—and I saw this ball, and felt it with my palm when I threw it.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that all this was very interesting, it was very difficult. It happened for several periods, the longest of which lasted from September 2007 to February 2008 without breaks. There were days when I could not read, and days when coordination of movements was broken to such an extent that it was difficult to walk.</p>\n<p>I managed to get out of this state due to the fact that I forced myself to start math again. By the middle of spring 2008 I could already function more or less normally and even went to Salt Lake City to look at the places where I wandered, not knowing where I was, in the spring of 2007. </p>\n</blockquote>",

Could this indexicality be the logical anchor of \"being in the world\" of Heidegger? I think one can illustrate this with an example: someone walking down a dark street hears footsteps approaching them from behind. She does not want to turn around for fear of showing her fear.  At this point her world contains as close possibility ones that could involve unpleasant situations. Turning around she sees her brother. This information immediately leads to a reassessment of which worlds are close, which is the feeling of relief. The fear vanishes. The birds are chirping in the trees.</p>",

That suddenly makes both a lot more interesting. Or recently constructive logic and co-constructive logics: suddenly I can see how Popper ties in with type theories via topoi.  Before that I would have not given a thought to Paraconsistent logic. But to know that it is the dual of constructive logic! Suddenly it is not an arbitrary thing...

His positing of the eternal heaven of non-mutable abstract objects is one of the reproaches, and its later effects on Christianity. Hegel was perhaps the first in the modern times  who saw a  thought as evolving dynamically. There were ancients esp. Empedocles who had prototypical evolutionary views of life and the cosmos as I discovered recently in <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/38903371/The_End_of_the_Metaphysics_of_Being_and_the_Beginning_of_the_Metacosmics_of_Entropy_2019_\">The End of the Metaphysics of Being and the Beginning of the Metacosmics of Entropy</a>. Heraclitus \"No man steps in the same river twice\" would be another emphasizing change.<br>\nI wonder if one can find the following reconciliation between Plato and Heraclitus. Could one think of Plato's philosophy as Algebraic (influenced as Plato was by writing), and Heraclitus as co-Algebraic? (Co-algebras being the mathematics of processes, change, modalities, ...)?</p>",

In that sense, category theory was no more than a tool to be used in homological algebra.</p>\n<p>But it turns out that category theory wasn't just a tool of homological algebra. It turned out that you could do a lot more with it, like set up an alternative foundation for mathematics, structure computer programs, etc.</p>\n<p>So you're right that the original goal of homological algebra was to compute invariants, but that doesn't mean homological algebra can't evolve into something else. As it turns out, the chain complexes studied in homological algebra are actually invariants themselves. The new realisation that John's talking about is that the proper objects of study in homological algebra should be chain complexes. </p>\n<p>In some sense, the invariants that chain complexes compute are shadows on the wall cast by the chain complexes themselves.

What happened to me during these years, perhaps, can be compared most closely to what happened to Karl Jung in 1913-14. Jung called it “confrontation with the unconscious”. I do not know what to call it, but I can describe it in a few words. Remaining more or less normal, apart from the fact that I was trying to discuss what was happening to me with people whom I should not have discussed it with, I had in a few months acquired a very considerable experience of visions, voices, periods when parts of my body did not obey me, and a lot of incredible accidents. The most intense period was in mid-April 2007 when I spent 9 days (7 of them in the Mormon capital of Salt Lake City), never falling asleep for all these days.</p>\n<p>Almost from the very beginning, I found that many of these phenomena (voices, visions, various sensory hallucinations), I could control. So I was not scared and did not feel sick, but perceived everything as something very interesting, actively trying to interact with those “beings” in the auditorial, visual and then tactile spaces that appeared around me (by themselves or by invoking them). I must say, probably, to avoid possible speculations on this subject, that I did not use any drugs during this period, tried to eat and sleep a lot, and drank diluted white wine.</p>\n<p>Another comment: when I say “beings”, naturally I mean what in modern terminology are called complex hallucinations. The word “beings” emphasizes that these hallucinations themselves “behaved”, possessed a memory independent of my memory, and reacted to attempts at communication. In addition, they were often perceived in concert in various sensory modalities. For example, I played several times with a (hallucinated) ball with a (hallucinated) girl—and I saw this ball, and felt it with my palm when I threw it.</p>\n<p>Despite the fact that all this was very interesting, it was very difficult. It happened for several periods, the longest of which lasted from September 2007 to February 2008 without breaks. There were days when I could not read, and days when coordination of movements was broken to such an extent that it was difficult to walk.</p>\n<p>I managed to get out of this state due to the fact that I forced myself to start math again. By the middle of spring 2008 I could already function more or less normally and even went to Salt Lake City to look at the places where I wandered, not knowing where I was, in the spring of 2007. </p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Source?</p>",

From the eyes of homotopy theory a 2-sphere is an infinity-groupoid - and a very complicated one indeed: nobody even knows all the groups of equivalence classes of automorphisms of automorphisms of automorphisms... automorphisms of an object in this infinity-groupoid!    It's a very rich and fascinating structure.  When we \"stabilize\" the 2-sphere, it simplifies a lot and becomes the sphere spectrum, which is more manageable but still quite rich.   When we then \"strictify\" it, it becomes even simpler and turns into a very simple chain complex.   So homological algebra is a great simplifier.  It's basically a way of turning infinity-groupoids into slightly glorified linear algebra.   It serves as a stepping-stone toward understanding the really interesting stuff in homotopy theory: the world of infinity-groupoids.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>if we are to overcome the era of printing and of command line mathematics, and go back to thinking in pictures and geometry, shouldn't we use pictures that live in our own space?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don't think so.   Pictures are good for 2- and 3-dimensional things, but a lot of the fun in topology lives in higher dimensions, where we need to use concepts rather than pictures.   Of course <em>algebraic</em> topology uses lots of commutative diagrams, and that's a great way to keep things vivid.</p>",

That allows her then to define the proper function of bodies parts as given by evolution, and from there placing language in the biological category.  One would need to be careful not to reduce thought to the biological and bring in Robert Brandom's point that speaking a language also brings in the notion of inference, and a duty to answer for what one says, and be able to question what someone says.  But she uses it to good effect to bring to light an aspect of language that may be overlooked if one only takes the inferentialist view. This way of thinking opens up the view of thought as evolutionary, and so opens up a space to talk about the ecology of ideas, of technics and life itself of course. I don't think she does that (but I have not read all her work).Her notion of a category here is not that from Category Theory, but perhaps something could be developed along those lines.</p>",

This is a pretty fine-grained notion of equivalence, and there are also \"up to\" methods for weakening it, etc. So you actually get a zoo of different notions of bisimulation.

It's probably a shame, but I think that reading is also a means to an end. Just because an author has structured the material in one way doesn't mean you have to follow that order strictly, or that the presented order will necessarily be exactly what you need. It also goes with the flow of human psychology: if you read with an agenda in mind, you tend to read more actively, instead of dozing off, as many people end up doing when they go in, teeth gnashing, with the \"I'm gonna read this entire book\" mentality.</p>",
