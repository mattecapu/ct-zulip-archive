I had vaguely heard about toposes in the Handbook of Mathematical Logic. so I wrote to Robin Gandy, as a logician in Oxford and asked if he could be my supervisor, if I managed to get the money to attend Oxford. He wrote back a lovely hand-written letter saying he was about to retire in two years, so was not accepting new students and hence maybe I should go to  Cambridge instead, and work with his ex-student, Martin Hyland.  Robin died in 1995 and I wish I had been more confident to talk to him more before that. but I'm pleased to say that I managed to thank him for sending me to Martin, who is simply fantastic!</p>",

I tried, and tried, and finally had to come to Martin and say: sorry the best I can do is to prove it's monoidal closed. it has a tensor and internal-hom and the adjunction works. but the tensor is not a product! instead of being disappointed Martin looked and said, ah, I think Girard has been saying interesting things about situations like this. let us check it out! then when we went to<br>\nCategories in Computer Science and Logic: Proceedings of the AMS-IMS-SIAM Joint Summer Research Conference Held June 14-20, 1987 in Boulder, CO, Robert Seely was very generous and offered me his slot in the program to talk about this model of Linear Logic!</p>",

Sure! talking about dialectica cats is something I never get tired of. I am giving a purely mathematical talk, just going over definitions and theorems to Andres Villaveces undergrad students on the 8th june. but chatting about it is much much more fun.<br>\n there are by now several variations on the cats, but originally there were two classes DC and GC (where C a cartesian closed cat with some extra strux). DC was the original Martin suggestion (based on Goedel's interpretation of the implication) and when I presented it in Boulder, Girard suggested the categories GC, where the G is for him. both DC and GC have the same objects triples (U, X, alpha), where alpha is a relation between U and X. the important thing is (as usual) the morphisms. between (U, X, alpha) and (V, Y, beta), we have a pair of maps f:U--&gt;V and F:Y--&gt;X satisfying a logical condition (if alpha(u, Fy) then beta(fu,y)).<br>\n Now it is hard to say what's the key idea behind these definitions, because it depends on your perspective. but let me try this one on you: it's a model construction for several logics (ILL, CLL, syntactic calculus,IL): what makes it interesting is the feeling that the left-hand side of the maps is like proving a theorem, while the right-handed side is like trying to refute the theorem. So it is like a superpower game: you don't go through the rounds, prover and verifier lay down their full strategy and check what would've have happened, either prover wins, or they lose it--verifier wins or the game is undetermined.<br>\nthere is a whole different story, if you prefer to compare dialectica categories to Chu spaces, but that it's kind of written down in TAC (DIALECTICA AND CHU CONSTRUCTIONS: COUSINS?).

In the book I read recently \"<a href=\"https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319911489\">Immanent Reasoning or Equality in Action</a>\" that is considered the strategy level. Are there any other major differences? Advantages of using Dialectica over Game Semantics or Dialogical reasoning as in the book I just mentioned?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>well, as Rongmin explained the name is only about the journal. Mike Shulman finds this terrible, I think it's perfectly sensible. Goedel didn't give a name to his interpretation, people probably referred to it as the interpretation that Goedel published in Dialectica,  from there to the Dialectica interpretation is an easy step. <br>\nthis is long (5 years?) before Abramsky and Jagadeesan's game semantics, which was based on earlier work of Blass (in the 70s, if I remember what I read in Blass). I haven't seen the book you mentioned! but there are billions of books in games that I haven't read. I tried to write an EPSRC project to study the game aspects of Dialectica, but it was not accepted. I wish I could find it again.</p>",

I thought of this based on what you said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>hi,<br>\nabout </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But you really want an \"if then\"?   I guess so, since you said so.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>yes, I do want an \"if-then\", not an if and only if. If you take the (adjunction) \"iff\" you end up with a morphism  like a Chu-morphism and eventually (depending on which calculations you want to do) you actually don't need \"two-sides\" of the world, only one, as by using the equality everything you do is dual.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I must be dumb, but I don't see the connection, even vaguely</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I agree that this is not obvious at all, but the point is that the direction forward works like many categorical models would, it satisfies the laws you'd expect, like products allow for projections, coproducts for injections,  realizability-like satisfaction of implication is ok, if you satisfy the antecedent, then you get the consequent, etc.<br>\n the right-hand side is not exactly an \"op\", but like it. and it's this (wrong) side of the world that enforces linearity of the constructions. so think of elements of U,V are proofs of alpha, beta <br>\nand elements of X,Y as refutations of alpha,beta.  and think of the if-then condition as a lax form of the adjunction one you were expecting. the point is that when you move from the cartesian world to the monoidal world you also move from isos<br>\nF(A&amp;B) = FA&amp;F(B) to lax transformations F(A)\\otimes F(B)--&gt; F(A\\otimes B) satisfying the required  coherence.</p>\n<p>Also one think that is important is that when you transpose one object you don't get its negation, you need to negate the relation too. so the negation of (U,X, alpha) is (X,U, not alpha) and this is not like classicla negation (not not A=A) but like intuitionistic negation A |- not not A, but not vice-versa.</p>\n<p>and sure about lax adjunctions, this is exactly what's happening here. the same way Street wrote his seminal paper on the  Formal theory of Monads and there were, if I remember correctly 16 possible categories of monads, depending on the directions you wanted to reverse, I think there are plenty of ways to  weaken the adjunction categories. I have not tried to do it.</p>",

I know from elsewhere that there are connections, but what was the path that you took?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>hey, keep missing things in this feed...<br>\nwell, the connection between dialectica categories and NLP is via the work on Glue Semantics. Glue is a semantic interpretation of LFG (Lexical Functional Grammar), the grammatical theory that the work on the Xerox Language Engine (XLE) is based on. <br>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glue_semantics\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glue_semantics</a>. Glue uses multiplicative linear logic as its basic mechanism for composition of  meanings of bits of  sentences. so I spend one year visiting PARC, before I joined in 2000, just talking and learning about glue. When I joined it was decided that Glue was very sophisticated and that the implemented system was going to use Transfer Semantics instead,  easier and cheaper to implement. Transfer is the basis of what I am still using nowadays. if anyone feels like trying it  out, our new semantic parser system is open source and has a demo at <a href=\"http://lap0973.sprachwiss.uni-konstanz.de:8080/sem.mapper/\">http://lap0973.sprachwiss.uni-konstanz.de:8080/sem.mapper/</a>. it's the doctoral work of Katerina Kalouli (from Konstanz, Germany) and I am extremely proud of her work. a full implementation from scratch, with different grammar theory, different parser, but a similar logic to the PARC Bridge system that I worked on.</p>",

I too would like to hear about dialectica categories, what they are, and what they are good for, etc. If you feel like it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>hey Joachim! assuming that you've got  what are the dialectica cats (see above or below),  two important points as far as the Dialectica and Linear Logic (LL)  connections go. the first is that since I was doing it in 1987, more or less when LL was coming up, it actually gave it LL a bit more of a pedigree, as Goedel's name is still pretty powerful and LL seemed to some people very strange then. But more importantly, Girard's coherence spaces are a collapsed model of LL, dialectica categories keep structures apart: tensor and cartesian products are distinct, not equiprovable at all! at that stage many people thought only categorical products were worth some attention and the fact that linear logic insists on monoidal closed structures and not cartesian structures was a source of disbelief. the fact that the semantic model from where Girard abstracted away his logic did not satisfy the existence of the two monoidal structures  was a minus. (even today reddit sent me a message of someone complaining how come there is a logic that is not monotonic? if a logic is not monotonic, how can it call itself logic? sigh!) but what was really neat and exciting about the first dialectica model was that I could provide a ! (an of course modality) that is co-free and that is not simply syntax in disguise.  the proof that it generates a model of IL is a single line! I could and should've have written it in my paper from Boulder 87, in generic form, as Robert Seely did. but I only wrote the version I needed, the one for my own category DC. a rookie mistake for sure!</p>",

I didn't like that at all. and I hated that the physicists were always one semester ahead of the Calculus you were learning in school, so you had to unlearn the bad ways of the physicists, before you could really make some progress in Analysis! (yeah, I know this is not going to get me any friends in this crowd, but this was how I felt then). So I ended up doing mathematics not because I loved it, but because it was the less boring thing I tried. And I thought I'd do a phd, to travel the world, but that after that I would do something more interesting like History or Literature for a living. But as everyone around here knows, these interesting things are the hard ones, mathematics is by comparison very easy. and satisfying. your theorem might be in fashion or not, but with a bit of luck is always true, it doesn't stop being correct. and you put correct things together and they carry on being correct. they don't stop for no good reason.

I was foolish enough to believe that because I had spent 5 years in the Computer Lab, Cambridge as a postdoc and had a permanent position in Birmigham that I would be able to find a job in the Bay Area. But  in the Bay Area  I fell between two stools: my work in Computing was too mathematical for the guys and my mathematical work was not good enough for the mathematicians. So I pivoted, as they do here, and became an AI person. had two great mentors for that: Danny Bobrow and Ron Kaplan, my managers at PARC.</p>\n<p>(Sorry @Rongmin the formatting in zulip still defeating me!)</p>",
