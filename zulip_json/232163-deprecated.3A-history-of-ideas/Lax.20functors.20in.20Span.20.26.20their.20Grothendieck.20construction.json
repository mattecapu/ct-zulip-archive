The primary problem with folklore isn't that the progenitor isn't known, but that there aren't any reference for precise statements and proofs. Sometimes you see authors write something like: \"The following lemma is folklore.\", which is probably fine (though in some of these situations it does seem to be a a shorthand for \"I didn't want to put in the effort to work out to whom the idea should be attributed.\"), but as soon as the result has been written out, it is no longer folklore.</p>",
