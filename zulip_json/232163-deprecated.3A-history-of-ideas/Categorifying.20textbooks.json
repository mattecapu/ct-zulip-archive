I think a really important thing that has to happen for category theory to see a general acceptance by the broader mathematics community is to have undergrad/grad texts in NOT category theory written with the categories up front, present from the beginning and throughout. Most undergrad texts have a prechapter on set theory, it should just also have baby category theory as well.</p>",

It really does take a lot of what we've learned from both mathematics and computer science (with a heavy emphasis on category theory and type theory), reorders it all, and presents it in a way that just makes a lot of sense. Still my favourite is that 'substitution' is the very first sub-section of the book, as it really is that foundational.</p>",
