Maybe you know a counterexample of this.</p>\n<p>I know that in 40s Mac Lane studied some general duality properties of groups (for example direct and free products). The idea of \"reversing the arrows\" was already on this time. But in a simple search, I could not find the definition of \"opposite category\" in Mac Lane or Eilenberg.  </p>\n<p>(I am trying to create a clear picture of the influence of Grothendieck at the beginning of the field.)</p>",
