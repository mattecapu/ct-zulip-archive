Varela was more mathematical inclined and used category theory to describe his ideas. In \"Prinicples of biological autonomy\" he describes autopoiesis as the complement of control. An engineer looks at a system and identifies the variables which can be used to control the system. The complementary view is autonomy, which describes which processes happen inside the system. These processes are also what creates the system, hence autopoiesis. So the complementary views are the control view from the outside and the recursive, autopoietic view from the inside.</p>",
