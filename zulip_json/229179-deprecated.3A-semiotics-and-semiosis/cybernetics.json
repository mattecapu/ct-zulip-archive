The part where I will agree is the logics: that one should be able to build entire systems of logical reasoning on the notion of apartness. One pointer is <a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/apartness+relation\" title=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/apartness+relation\">https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/apartness+relation</a> and from programming languages (PL), there is \"separation logic\" which applies this idea to reason about memory safety in the presence of pointer aliasing. I think if anybody has doubts about this, it becomes a lot more compelling when you think about the road more often travelled, which is to take identity and equality as primitive. I have this draft blog post about the formulation of Church's simple theory of types (simply typed <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>λ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\lambda</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.69444em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathdefault\">λ</span></span></span></span>-calculus which only has equality as a primitive notion (Andrews <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>Q</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">Q_0</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"katex-html\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8777699999999999em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathdefault\">Q</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t vlist-t2\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.30110799999999993em;\"><span style=\"top:-2.5500000000000003em;margin-left:0em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\">0</span></span></span></span><span class=\"vlist-s\">​</span></span><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.15em;\"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>). There is a rich literature on how identity and equality are fundamental to Martin-Loef type theory and HoTT.</p>\n<p>The part where I'd want to differentiate (can't help the meta-irony) is to equate logic and meaning. I would say, creation of new signs and meanings is probably accompanied by a common (or common enough) understanding of rules, attributes, and yes, logical axioms and systems of reasoning, but there is a lot more to it. For example, I would guess that the inadequacy of existing systems motivates creation of new ones.</p>\n<p>Let's take \"justification\" as a symbol whose complex meaning is currently \"in production\". I followed some lovely threads on twitter, where the frequent use of \"just\" is discussed as being sometimes lucid, often well-meaning, but for newcomers can also be alienating since it presupposes understanding and can be (mis)understood as patronizing. The ironic use of \"justification\" is catchy, but I want to call out that the attitude - that while attractive to specialists, one should take care of not alienating newcomers - is such a powerful, constructive thing which carries inherent meaning; and still we'd have a hard time capturing all that using logic. Not all use of \"just\" will be bad and alienating, but calling  out \"justification\" will always be helpful. I think since this appears in the context of ACT community discussing category theory, I think this is something where we flip between the object logic/language \"a properad is ...\" and the meta-level (or maybe the meta meta level). There is a pragmatic aspect here.</p>\n<p>I do think taking Cybernetics as an angle, identify/apartness as a primitive to build formal systems / reasoning is a rich angle, and the need to adapt/create new systems is a challenge to any system. The closest I have seen is Piaget's developmental theory of knowledge (I somehow dislike the term '<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_epistemology\" title=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_epistemology\">genetic epistemology</a>' but it is how he called his theory), where children have a model of reality which they adapt, and they do this for different kinds of knowledge.</p>",

I think on the one hand, academic on research in formal logic is concerned with expressiveness and limits of reasoning.  So \"anything that can be expressed in language/system X can be expressed in Y\" is an insight worth stating.</p>\n<p>Now category theory has been called the \"structure mathematics\" and also something like an ultimate achievement of the axiomatic method (since everything that is expressed follows from a few axioms). Also, a hundred years ago, every PhD student came up with their own system of formal reasoning (some parallels to PL research today where everybody builds their own language and/or type system sound).</p>\n<p>Jokes aside, in programming languages \"you can write X as just Y\" is basically everywhere. I think a more generous way to look at \"just\" is that showing alternative ways of expressing the same things is something close to analogy (with the difference that analogy is not always regarded as proof, while X is just Y is often something that can be proved).</p>",

        "content": "<p>I write in this thread though it has been asleep for about a year now, since I see <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"275946\">@Johannes Drever</span>  and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"276679\">@Jonathan Beardsley</span>  have been speaking openly about Laws of Form and the other contributors seem to have appreciated. Moreover I see everybody knows Varela. So I think it is the right place to ask something without being cowed. </p>\n<p>Besides all the criticism one can make to Spencer Brown style and work, I think the truly interesting thing about Laws of Form is that it tries to formally model the act of drawing a mark on a sheet of paper, i.e. making a distinction, and this is an act which coincide with its own result. <br>\nThis aspect is shared by other concepts in natural languages (at least those coming from Latin, which are those I know, I would be curious about other roots...). Take for instance \"organization\", which points both to an \"it\" and to the \"process leading to it\". Similar are \"abstraction\",  \"(re)cognition\", \"assertion\",\"judgement\",\"sight\"  and many other. All these share the fact of being \"perfect in themselves\", and may be couterposed with other, which have a \"progressive\" nature, such as \"walk\", for instance. Somehow this recalls the distinction between \"energheia\" and \"kinesis\" in Aristotle's terms. <br>\nIn a sense, the distinction is the archetype of all these concepts and in my opinion Spencer Brown's attempt to formalize it is valuable, despite the mixed feelings it arouses in the math community. </p>\n<p>Now, probably all I written above is very well known by all of you here. What I would like to ask is: <br>\n                    Which mathematical concepts offer, in your opinion, a semantical domain to interpret the act of distinction?<br>\n                    Which mathematical structure embodies this identification of  act and result? <br>\n                    Can we find answers in categories or generalizations? <br>\nI think these would be interesting question to answer, and that our difficulty to relate with Spencer Brown ideas comes from thinking in terms of sets, functions, relations. A function can stand for a process, but it will always detach act and result: it will always be some black box which converts input in output, and we can tell input (domain) output (codomain) and process (the function as a subset of  Domain X Codomain). <br>\nInstead, I think we would need something different, in a sense something which groups ore lambda algebras have, where each element  can act on the structure itself (this is I think what Kauffman does with magmas). Or a kind of graph, where somehow vertexes can be edges. </p>\n<p>All the above is quite imprecise, but I would like if somebody could share their thoughts about it</p>",
