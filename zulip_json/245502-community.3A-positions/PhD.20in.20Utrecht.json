        "content": "<p>I am looking for a PhD student to study with me at Utrecht University in the Netherlands to start by 1 Jan 2024 on homotopy type theory or similar topics in (higher) category theory, type theory, and/or homotopy theory. The position is for 4 or 5 years, depending on how much teaching is involved, and will be a split position between the mathematics and computer science departments. Utrecht is a great place to do homotopy type theory: the math department is strong in logic, (oo-)category theory, and homotopy theory; the computer science department has a strong PL group; and there is a lot of interaction with homotopy type theorists in other Dutch universities.</p>\n<p>If you are interested, please send me an email at <a href=\"mailto:p.r.north@uu.nl\">p.r.north@uu.nl</a>. If you know anyone who might be interested, please forward this message to them.</p>",
