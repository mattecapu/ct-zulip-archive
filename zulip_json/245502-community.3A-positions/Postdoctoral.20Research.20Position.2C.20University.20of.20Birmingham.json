The position is funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) and provides support for 18 months of full-time research, with a possible further extension by another 6 months.</p>\n<p>The successful candidate will contribute to the project \"Higher-Order Monad-based Programming and Reasoning (HOMBRe)\", which explores foundational aspects of program semantics and verification. A central focus of the project is the treatment of computational effects via monads and their generalizations as well as the semantics of iteration and recursion via trace operators, with particular interest in the notion of guarded traces.</p>\n<p>The project welcomes a broad range of perspectives across functional-imperative programming, verification logics, and categorical semantics.</p>\n<p>The position is open immediately and preferably to be filled as soon as possible. Applications will be considered on a rolling basis.</p>\n<p>To apply, use the following link to the University's Job Portal: <a href=\"https://edzz.fa.em3.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience/en/sites/CX_6001/jobs?keyword=105667&amp;mode=location\">https://edzz.fa.em3.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience/en/sites/CX_6001/jobs?keyword=105667&amp;mode=location</a></p>\n<p>Send your informal inquiries to Sergey Goncharov (<a href=\"mailto:S.Goncharov@bham.ac.uk\">S.Goncharov@bham.ac.uk</a>)</p>",
