Right now I am learning bisimulation and coinduction by going through (Sangiorgi 2011) on my own in order to study the properties of federated rule execution, but feel that I need some help to get through the book. </p>\n<p>I am looking for paid private tutoring online or in person (if you are in Stockholm and not going away after midsommar), approx 2-4 h/week. Please PM me if you are available.</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nAndrew</p>",
