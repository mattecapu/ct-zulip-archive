They now have openings for a number of people who know category theory - <a href=\"https://jobs.gusto.com/boards/-67195a74-31b4-4052-ba18-e859d461808c\">see here for job listings</a>.</p>\n<p>They write:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At Symbolica, we are building deep learning models which perform <em>structured reasoning</em>: manipulate structured data, learn algebraic structure in it, and do so with an interpretable and verifiable logic. To that end, we are developing new mathematical foundations for deep learning: <a href=\"http://www.categoricaldeeplearning.com/\">categorical deep learning</a>. We are now assembling a R&amp;D lab of expert category theory and machine learning researchers to develop this theory and apply it to the problems of code synthesis and theorem proving. We are committed to fundamental ideas, but also their execution in practice.</p>\n</blockquote>",
