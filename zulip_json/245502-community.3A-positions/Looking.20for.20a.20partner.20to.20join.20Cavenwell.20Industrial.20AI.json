We are an early stage startup seeking to provide AI based Business and HealthTech solutions.  The problem we are attempting to solve is that of Explainability, where Neural Nets act like black boxes and do not provide reasons or explanations for the directives they offer their users.</p>\n<p>Here at Cavenwell, we are in the midst of our seed fundraising round and there has been some good traction.   Early on, we partnered with <a href=\"http://Conexus.ai\">Conexus.ai</a>, and I am colleagues with their Chief Scientist David Spivak.  Also ongoing are several collaborations with the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario in Ottawa for Clinical and Operations Research decision-making as well as collaborations with researchers at Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto.<br>\nOur technology is designed using Category Theory and is arguably a little bit ahead of the publicly available research on Category Theory for Machine Learning.  The patent for our core AI has been filed in The United States.  The software is written in Python </p>\n<p>I am looking for a talented Computer Scientist, Programmer, Category Theorist and Machine Learning enthusiast to join the company in a partnership role.  If this interests you, please reach out to me here: </p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:ben@cavenwell.ai\">ben@cavenwell.ai</a></p>\n<p>We will require that you sign an NDA in the interview process.</p>",
