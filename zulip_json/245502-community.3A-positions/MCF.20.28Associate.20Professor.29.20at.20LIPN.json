        "content": "<p>LIPN (the CS lab at Université Sorbonne Paris Nord) is opening a <em>maître de conférence</em> position (MCF, roughly equivalent to Associate Professor) in the logic group.</p>\n<p>We seek someone who may contribute to one of the following research topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Theory of programming languages: any research topic in line with the expertise of the group (linear logic, lambda-calculus, denotational semantics).  Additional expertise and interest in the following topics will be appreciated: semantics of probabilistic or differentiable programming languages, category theory and its applications to computer science, complexity and quantitative program analysis.</li>\n<li>Proof assistants and type theory: albeit not a central theme in the group, this topic may be reinforced by a MCF with direct experience in formal proofs (program correctness, formalization of mathematical theories...) or with expertise in the foundations of proof assistants, such as type theory and its semantics.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Teaching for this position is <strong>very peculiar</strong>: it's at the Département de Gestion (Accounting) of IUT St-Denis, and basically involves teaching Word, Excel, elementary database stuff, etc.  It's far from exciting but, on the plus side, it leaves plenty of time for research.  Also, there is the possibility of teaching a limited number of hours in more \"usual\" undergraduate and graduate level classes at the CS Department.</p>\n<p>Fluency in French is expected.</p>\n<p>Deadline for application is March 29th.</p>",
