PRC) starting in the fall<br>\n2021-2022 and running till the end of 2025. ReCiProg aims at extending the<br>\nproofs-as-programs correspondence (aka Curry-Howard correspondence) to<br>\nrecursive programs and circular proofs for logics and type systems using<br>\ninduction and coinduction. The project will contribute both to the<br>\nnecessary theoretical foundations of circular proofs and to the software<br>\ndevelopment allowing to enhance the use of coinductive types and<br>\ncoinductive reasoning in the Coq proof assistant.</p>\n<p><em>More informations</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>More informations can be found on the project webpage:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.irif.fr/reciprog/index\">https://www.irif.fr/reciprog/index</a> and<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.irif.fr/reciprog/post-doc-offer-dec2021\">https://www.irif.fr/reciprog/post-doc-offer-dec2021</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>RECIPROG ANR project will open further positions in the coming two years,<br>\nincluding two more postdoctoral positions in the above teams, and a PhD<br>\nposition in LIRICA Team, LIS, Marseille.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Interested candidates may contact the project coordinator (Alexis Saurin)<br>\nas well as the local coordinators (Guilhem Jaber, Denis Kuperberg, Luigi<br>\nSantocanale &amp; Alexis Saurin).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>--<br>\nAlexis Saurin<br>\nIRIF - CNRS, Université de Paris &amp; INRIA</p>\n</blockquote>",
