As<br>\nmany of you are probably aware, the group here is pretty active: we have<br>\nSteve Lack and myself as continuing academics, Ross Street, Dominic<br>\nVerity and Mike Johnson as emeritus professors, and John Power as an<br>\nhonorary professor; plus a community of 11 postgraduate students and a<br>\ncouple of postdocs.</p>\n<p>This is a Lecturer position, analogous to a UK lecturer or a US<br>\nassistant professor, with a base salary of AU$110,000-$130,000, and is a<br>\nbalanced academic role with 40% research, 40% teaching and 20% service.<br>\nWe expect the formal advertisement to be live at the start of February<br>\nwith a closing date early in March. This rather short period is forced<br>\nupon us by federal government rules, so it seems best to get word out<br>\nnow.</p>\n<p>Please feel free to distribute this message further, and don't hesitate<br>\nto get in touch if you have any questions about anything to do with<br>\nthis.</p>\n<p>Richard<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
