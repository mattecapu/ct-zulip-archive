It lies within the philosophical<br>\nposition known as inferentialism. As such, P-tS offers an alternative foundation<br>\nfor mathematical logic that places reasoning at the heart of meaning.</p>\n<p>Non-classical, including substructural, logics are important classes of logics<br>\nthat support more controlled reasoning than classical logic. They have found<br>\nsignificant academic and industrial application as the basis for tools for<br>\nreasoning about program and system correctness, where their ability to support<br>\nreasoning about the decomposition of structure is crucial in managing complexity<br>\nand scale, and in AI. The treatment of substructural and other non-classical<br>\nlogics in P-tS, especially those of significance for agency, resource modelling,<br>\nand theories of information (e.g., relevance/modal/epistemic logics), requires<br>\ndevelopment.</p>\n<p>P-tS has two primary variants: Dummett-Prawitz validity, closely related to<br>\nBrouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov semantics, and base-extension semantics, which can<br>\nbe seen as bridge to model-theoretic semantics. Base-extension semantics will<br>\nbe the primary focus of this project, with the Dummett-Prawitz view also relevant.</p>\n<p>This studentship (intersecting informatics, mathematics, philosophy) will address<br>\ngiving proof-theoretic semantics to non-classical logics, developing the necessary<br>\nabstract mathematical meta-theory and exploring the significance of inferentialist<br>\nsemantics, and its mathematical realization, for systems verification. This latter<br>\naspect will build directly on connections between the proof-theoretic foundations<br>\nof logic programming and base-extension semantics recently established at UCL.<br>\nConnections to simulation modelling and its inferentialist interpretation may be<br>\nexplored.</p>\n<p>The student will work with Prof. David Pym (Computer Science and Philosophy),<br>\nDr. Elaine Pimentel (Computer Science), and Prof. Tim Button (Philosophy),<br>\nand be based in the Programming Principles, Logic, and Verification group.</p>\n<p>Candidates should have a Master’s degree in mathematics, philosophy, or<br>\ncomputer science and a strong interest in logic.</p>\n</blockquote>",
