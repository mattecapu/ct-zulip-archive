The default starting date would be Oct 2025 (as they are funded through an ERC project on type theory starting in fall 2025), but earlier/later starts may be possible. If you are looking for a position, please get in touch. </p>\n<p><strong>PhD positions</strong>:</p>\n<p>If you are looking for a PhD position, please let me know your interest by email, ideally before <strong>December 15</strong>. I will review applications on a rolling basis. You can check out my website (link below) to see the areas I am working in, but in general, I'm happy to advise on projects in areas such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Homotopy type theory in general</li>\n<li>Higher categories</li>\n<li>Two-level type theory</li>\n<li>Type theories with shapes, such as simplicial type theory</li>\n<li>Conservativity questions</li>\n<li>Constructive ordinal numbers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The PhD positions are for (at least) 3.5 years, include all tuition fees, and come with a stipend at the UKRI standard (currently approx. Â£19,200 net annually, increases with inflation). You will not be obliged to teach but there will be opportunities to do so, paid on top of the stipend. A generous budget for travel (conference attendance, research visits, etc) is available. The place of work is Nottingham, where we have a vibrant culture of regular seminars and meetings. Current members of our group can be found on our group website: <a href=\"https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/fp-lab/\">https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/fp-lab/</a></p>\n<p><strong>Postdoc positions</strong>:</p>\n<p>I will advertise the postdoc positions again closer to the date and the official application portal is not yet open. However, feel free to contact me at any time for questions/discussions.</p>\n<p>Best wishes,<br>\nNicolai<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:nicolai.kraus@nottingham.ac.uk\">nicolai.kraus@nottingham.ac.uk</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~psznk/\">https://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~psznk/</a></p>",
