We will also work with bits and pieces of topology and<br>\nprobability theory. But don't worry if you're unfamiliar with some of<br>\nthese topics -- most important is that you're eager to learn!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Starting date</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The starting date is preferably 1st April 2022.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Context</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This position is part of a broader research project that involves<br>\nseveral researchers across different institutions in the north of<br>\nPortugal. The overarching goal is to establish mathematical<br>\nfoundations for a discipline of hybrid programming capable of<br>\nhandling noise and uncertainty in a principled, rigorous way.</p>\n<p>In case you're not familiar with the concept, a hybrid program combines<br>\nclassical program constructs with differential equations to model, among<br>\nother things, interactions between digital devices and physical<br>\nprocesses (such as velocity, movement, and energy). Examples of hybrid<br>\nprograms can be found in [1,6] and in my webpage.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How to apply</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please send me an email no later than 22nd December 2021 with<br>\nthe following two items:</p>\n<p>+ a cover letter;<br>\n  + a detailed CV.</p>\n<p>In the meanwhile if you have any questions about the position,<br>\nincluding living in Portugal, please do not hesitate to contact me!<br>\nBtw, Portugal is known as one of the safest countries in the world<br>\n[3]; has lots of sunshine, pristine beaches, and great food [4,5].</p>\n<p>--<br>\nRenato Neves<br>\n<a href=\"https://di.uminho.pt/~nevrenato/\">https://di.uminho.pt/~nevrenato/</a></p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p>[1] Sergey Goncharov, Renato Neves, and José Proença. \"Implementing hybrid semantics: From functional to imperative.\" International Colloquium on Theoretical Aspects of Computing.
