I would appreciate it if you could forward this information to anyone who might be interested.

Thus teaching is not expected, but possible if desired. The intended starting date for both positions is October 1. The deadline for applications is July 15. See the links below for how to apply.</p>\n<p>If there are any further questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch!
