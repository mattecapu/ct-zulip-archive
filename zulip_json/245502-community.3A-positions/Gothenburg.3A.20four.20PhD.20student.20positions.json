        "content": "<p>The Logic and Types group at Chalmers and Gothenburg university is recruiting four PhD students to work on dependent type theory for mathematics and computer science together with Prof. Thierry Coquand and others in the group.</p>\n<p>The project is about homotopy type theory and univalent foundations, where type theory is extended with univalence and higher inductive types. The selected PhD students would be working on topics ranging from theoretical studies of models and <strong>connections to higher category theory</strong> to actual formalisations of mathematics, but they could also work more oriented toward implementation of proof systems, in particular connected to Agda.</p>\n<p>It is worth noting that the selected students will get a full time employment with all the benefits of a usual employment in Sweden (health and pension benefits, paid holidays, etc).</p>\n<p>Deadline for application: <strong>November 4th 2022</strong> (in two weeks!)</p>\n<p>More information: <a href=\"https://web103.reachmee.com/ext/I005/1035/job?site=7&amp;lang=UK&amp;validator=9b89bead79bb7258ad55c8d75228e5b7&amp;job_id=27467\">https://web103.reachmee.com/ext/I005/1035/job?site=7&amp;lang=UK&amp;validator=9b89bead79bb7258ad55c8d75228e5b7&amp;job_id=27467</a></p>",
