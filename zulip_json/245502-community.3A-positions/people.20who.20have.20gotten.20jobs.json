That's where he had previously gotten his masters degree in computer science under Cristian Calude.  Calude and I served as his co-advisors for his Ph.D. Apart from a paper <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.2067\">connecting thermodynamics to algorithmic entropy</a>, Mike and I worked on applications of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.0340\">symmetric monoidal categories</a> and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1053\">compact closed bicategories</a> to computation. He has continued developing these ideas ever since, most recently working with my student <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"275899\">@Christian Williams</span> on a paper about type theory, making extensive use of ideas from topos theory.</p>\n<p>In 2016 he began a startup called Pyrofex.
