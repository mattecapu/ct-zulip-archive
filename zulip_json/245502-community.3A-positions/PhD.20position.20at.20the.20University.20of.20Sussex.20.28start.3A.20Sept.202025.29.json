The PhD will be in the Department of Informatics, but could include a significant portion of pure category theory. The <strong>closing date for applications is 14th May</strong>.</p>\n<p>The exact project can be tailored to the successful applicant, but will likely focus on using category theory to understand the structure and behaviour of programming languages. My research tends to make use of 2-dimensional category theory and ideas from categorical logic and universal algebra. </p>\n<p>Sussex's <a href=\"https://www.sussex.ac.uk/foss/people\">Foundations of Software Systems group</a> has recently been growing, and hosts researchers with interests across logic and programming languages. The university campus is just outside the seaside town of Brighton, and almost entirely surrounded by the South Downs national park.</p>\n<p>For more information, see the Sussex page <a href=\"https://www.sussex.ac.uk/study/fees-funding/phd-funding/view/1840-PhD-Informatics-Studentship:-Denotational-semantics-via-(2-dimensional)-categories\">here</a> or feel free to email me at <a href=\"mailto:p.saville@sussex.ac.uk\">p.saville@sussex.ac.uk</a>.</p>",
