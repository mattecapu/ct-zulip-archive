Another thing that is not directly related with the project butI hope I'll be able to do anyway is to apply sheaf and (co)homology methods to consensus mechanisms and network models in general, and maybe also to natural language processing <span aria-label=\"grinning\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f600\" role=\"img\" title=\"grinning\">:grinning:</span></p>",

In general, from a company perspective it is difficult to justify expenditure for basic theoretical research. Whereas you can go to your investors and say \"I am paying a developer to do X\", how do you exactly motivate that you are paying someone to publish papers? So, in general, I think it's wise to keep the academic side of the business in academia, especially given that the research I'm carrying out now is still very much related to what Statebox is doing <span aria-label=\"smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f642\" role=\"img\" title=\"smile\">:smile:</span></p>",
