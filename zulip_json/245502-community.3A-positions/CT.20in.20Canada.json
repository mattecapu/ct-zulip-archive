Ottawa (Pieter Hofstra, Rick Blute, Phil Scott, Simon Henry), Dalhousie (Peter Selinger, Dorette Pronk), and U. Calgary (Robin Cockett in the CS department, with some category-theory-friendly people like Kristine Bauer in the math department).  My university (Mount Allison) doesn't have a Phd program, but I can supervise PhD students jointly with people at Dalhousie (I previously supervised Evangelia Aleiferi, and am currently supervising Marcello Lanfranchi, both jointly with Dorette).  Brandon University (where Rory is) also doesn't have a PhD in math program, but he may also be able to jointly supervise with others (not sure, would have to contact him).</p>\n<p>For postdocs, there has been a fair bit of recent success of category theory people getting national or regional postdoctoral fellowships in Canada: Rory got both an NSERC (national) and AARMS (Atlantic regional) postdoctoral fellowship, JS Lemay currently has an NSERC postdoc (working with me), Jonathan Gallagher just finished an AARMS postdoc (working with Dorette and myself), and Martin Szyld and Geoff Vooys both currently have AARMS postdocs (both working with Dorette).  Michael Lambert is also working with me as a postdoc.  Martti (at Ottawa) and Jason (at Brandon) were mentioned above.  And I just remembered Matt Amy at Dal, who also has an AARMS postdoc!  There's probably some more I'm missing as well...  </p>\n<p>For tenure-track positions, unfortunately I don't know of any right now.  I would hope that Calgary, Ottawa, and Dal would continue to hire category-theory-related people, but one never knows how hiring will go.</p>",
