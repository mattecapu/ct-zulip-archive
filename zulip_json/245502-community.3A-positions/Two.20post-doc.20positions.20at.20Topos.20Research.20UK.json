Topos is looking to grow our UK team,  so while this position is currently funded by a 1-year project, selected candidates may have the opportunity for extension or even to transition into a permanent role.</p>\n<p>We’re looking for candidates with PhDs in category theory, type theory, algebraic systems theory, or related areas in mathematics and computer science who are interested in applying their knowledge to practical problems of scientific modelling. We’ll be working on compositional scientific modelling, model validation, and structure-aware version control.</p>\n<p>We’re hiring for two work projects: in the first, we’ll be developing double categorical systems theory, using monoidal double categories to organise the composition of systems and using monoidal double categories of spans or relations to organise the logic of system validation. </p>\n<p>In the second, we’ll be researching structure-aware version control (using type theory / logical relations and categorical patch theory) for the purpose of version controlling and incrementally updating scientific models.</p>\n<p>Please reach out to me at <a href=\"mailto:davidjaz@topos.institute\">davidjaz@topos.institute</a> with any inquiries or questions, and for more info, follow this link: </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://topos.site/blog/2024-08-30-postdoc-job-openings-in-topos-oxford/\">https://topos.site/blog/2024-08-30-postdoc-job-openings-in-topos-oxford/</a></p>\n<p>Cheers,<br>\nDavid Jaz</p>",
