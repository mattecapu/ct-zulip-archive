We are investigating axiomatic calculi of string diagrams for categories of probabilistic processes, also with applications to Bayesian inference and probabilistic graphical models.<br>\nTwo postdoc positions will be available to work on this project at University College London, with starting date between October and January, and end date August 2025 (with the possibility of extending for one more year if the project is approved for a second round of funding). Funds will be also available for travelling to conferences, workshops, and research visits.<br>\nThe project requires a PhD in Computer Science or Mathematics (or close to completion) by the starting date, and previous research experience in at least two of the following areas: applied category theory, probabilistic programming, (Bayesian) probabilistic graphical models. <br>\nIf you are interested in applying please contact me directly via email at <a href=\"mailto:f.zanasi@ucl.ac.uk\">f.zanasi@ucl.ac.uk</a>. (Note I do not check Zulip very regularly so if you write me there I may miss it.)</p>",
