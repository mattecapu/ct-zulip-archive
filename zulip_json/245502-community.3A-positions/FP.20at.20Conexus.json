Particularly desired backgrounds include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>experience with Haskell parsec</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>experience implementing data oriented systems at scale, e.g., indexing, pipelining, vectorizing, magic sets algorithms, chase algorithms, join algorithms, etc</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>experience with formal verification, e.g., Coq, Hoare Logic, type inference, model checking, automated theorem proving, etc</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>UK citizenship, US citizenship, or Saudi citizenship</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because our core technology IP is specified categorically, using co-presheaves and adjoint functors, a background in category theory is also a plus; type theory and formal methods also pervade our technology as implementation techniques.  Although these are not research positions per se - they are programming positions - we do a lot of applied research out of necessity and employees are encouraged to publish.  Our team of functional programmers and mathematicians spans from San Francisco to Dubai and is remote friendly. </p>\n<p>Interested applicants should contact Ryan Wisnesky, <a href=\"mailto:ryan@conexus.com\">ryan@conexus.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://conexus.com\">https://conexus.com</a> (company info)<br>\n<a href=\"https://categoricaldata.net\">https://categoricaldata.net</a> (technology info)<br>\n<a href=\"https://wisnesky.net\">https://wisnesky.net</a> (my info)</p>",
