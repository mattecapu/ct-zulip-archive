        "content": "<p>Hello everyone.</p>\n<p>I am a final year Mathematics undergraduate student in India. This year, I will be applying for a Master's/PhD programme to continue my studies. However, I know little about which places to apply to (barring Johns Hopkins and Macquarie), and would be really grateful for any suggestions in this regard.</p>\n<p>As far as my interests go: I am fascinated by Category Theory (especially Infinity Categories) and Topology. I am presently working on my UG thesis, for which I'm trying to learn about Riehl-Verity's model-agnostic approach.  Apart from this, I am interested in Homotopy Theory and Model Categories.  In case more details would be helpful, I will certainly add them.</p>\n<p>Once again, I would really appreciate any advice on this.</p>\n<p>PS. This is my first post here, and in case there are any problems with it, please do let me know.</p>",
