        "content": "<p>As a graph (structure) theorist, to determine qualitative information (equilibria, etc) about a dynamical system, my instinct would be to study the graph-theoretical structure of a reaction network. I saw a talk of John's in which he mentioned that one wants to be able to pass between two different views: 'networks as processes' and 'networks as objects'. It turns out that, since we're in a bicategory, we can switch between these views by working within a homcategory. This idea got me thinking that perhaps we could use this to our advantage when studying reaction networks: what do the dynamical systems that correspond to tree-like (i.e. low treewidth) reaction networks look like? And what happens when we compose many reaction networks of low tree-width?<br>\n(One doesn't need to focus on low tree-width, it's just an example.)</p>\n<p>Conveniently, Zoltan Kocsis, Jade Master and I (in preparation) have been studying a certain kind of bicategory (think slice of Span(K)' for some category K) which we use to generalize graph-theoretic invariants which summarise the global shape of graph' to arbitrary categories and I wonder how this relates to John and Blake's gray- and black-box functors. Indeed I'd conjecture that our structural stuff (which measures the global `shape' of a network) should be liftable by the  gray- and black-box functors to dynamical systems and equilibria...</p>\n<p>These are still very vague thoughts, but I think that there's definitely something worth studying here :)</p>",

If you remove any edge of a tree, you split the tree into more than one part (same for any internal node); tree decompositions generalise this: if you remove from a graph G any <em>bag</em> (blob in the picture) or any <em>edge</em> (intersection of adjacent blobs) given in a tree decompositon of G, you split G into more than one part.  So, insofar as connectivity is concerned, tree decompositions capture the `global tree-shape' of a graph. (I given a imo very gentle intro to this in Sec 1.2 of my <a href=\"https://theses.gla.ac.uk/82496/\">thesis</a>.) </p>\n<p>This idea can be generalised to other shapes (paths, cycles, etc..) and to other categories (this is part of what Jade, Zoltan and I are doing; this new stuff also generalises and improves upon earlier work which is in the `Spined Categories' chapter of my thesis) .</p>",
