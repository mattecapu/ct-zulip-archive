I think the key buzzword is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_manifold\">center manifold</a>.   And the key idea is this: a dynamical system can have a submanifold that states rapidly approach, while the move more slowly <em>on</em> that submanifold. </p>\n<p>Before reading anything, check out this animated gif  of a dynamical system with a center manifold:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_manifold#/media/File:CentreMfld.gif\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_manifold#/media/File:CentreMfld.gif</a></p>\n<p>Unfortunately this gif is not looped so you have to reload it to watch the states approach the center manifold again!</p>",

I'll call these regions \"0\" and \"1\". You start out near region 0 and slowly move across it until you reach a special point at which time you fly off the center manifold and zoom towards region 1. Then the reverse happens. You slowly move across region 1 until you get to a special point and then you fly off towards region 0.  And this repeats! Hence ...010101...</p>",
