One of the important concepts in LoF is that they deal with distinctions and the naming of distinctions without specifying the domain of the distinction.  That makes them applicable to individual things or to any aspect, facet, property, or characteristic of an individual thing.  The LoF formalize the concept of \"levels of abstraction\", thus formally establishing the categories that Category Theory takes.</p>\n<p>May the Form be with you!<br>\nBest regards,<br>\nLyle</p>",

If you want arcs and bubbles to talk about processes, then I suggest you explore the Data Flow Diagrams of \"Structured Analysis and System Specification\" by Tom DeMarco.   It takes you though the steps of modeling the current system, converting that physical model to a logical, i.e. implementation independent, model. of the current system, creating the logical model of the new system, and finally the physical model of the new system.  We used it, along with an automated documentation tool I developed to quadruple military software productivity in the early 1980s.   That is when I learned about sticking my head up above the crowd.

That is the word \"context\" has quite a history in logic and philosophy (<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/web-cats/CG/-/issues/26\">a few pointers</a>) which in my view relates it to modal logic, so I hope it is not used just as a shorthand for nary relations...
