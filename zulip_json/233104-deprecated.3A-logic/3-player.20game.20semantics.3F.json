The key feature of games, by comparison with the many extant models of computation (labelled transition systems, event structures, etc. etc.) is that they provide an explicit representation of the environment, and hence model interaction in an intrinsic fashion. (By contrast, interaction is modelled in, say, labelled transition systems using some additional structure, typically a “synchronization algebra” on the labels.) One-person games would degenerate to transition systems; it seems that multi-party interaction can be adequately modeled by two-person games, in much the same way that functions with multiple arguments can be reduced to one-place functions and tupling.</p>",
