I'm thinking of something along the lines of _Sheaves in Geometry and Logic_, VI 10, where Mac Lane and Moerdijk prove the equivalence of topos-theoretic and set-theoretic foundations. But I wonder if anyone has used this approach to prove equiconsistency results between (some flavor of) type theory and (some flavor of) set theory.</p>",
