I'm actually currently going through his paper on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00269\">Conjugate Priors</a>, which discusses Bayesian updating and parametric Bayes (and I have actually been acquiring some questions with regards to that paper, which could form a nice discussion). <br>\nI agree that one should start with things that are easier to read and address simpler ideas before moving on to more advanced topics. Personally, I can say with confidence (only based on the fact that I've read many of their papers!) that anything written by Fritz, Perrone, Fong, and Jacobs is well-written (in the sense that it is not only accessible but also precise, not overly technical, and contains examples one can check their understanding with). The top five papers I recommend (the first four are purely based on me having read parts of them and knowing that the material is solid and <em>reasonably</em> accessible) are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Perrone's PhD thesis (best introduction to monads I have ever seen, gets technical in later chapters, which is to be expected since Paolo's work is on quite general complete metric spaces, but still well-written if that's what you want to lean towards)</li>\n<li>Fritz \"A synthetic...\" (overall good paper from start to finish that does not get too technical except in certain remarks and examples---one can go a long way by keeping in mind probabilities on finite sets)</li>\n<li>Fong's thesis (overall solid and reviews a lot of the measure theory)</li>\n<li>Jacobs \"conjugate priors\" (I forgot to put this on the list, but it should be---it is a short paper, focuses on a very narrow idea, namely updating, which is very good since it helps solidify the categorical ideas introduced, plus he gives a nice example one could work with)<br>\nnot necessarily in this order, <br>\nwith the addition of 5. McCullaugh (haven't read, but am willing to dedicate some time to this). <br>\nWhen I get a chance, I'll also look at the abstracts and browse the contents of the papers we've compiled and also let you know (this may take a few days though...)</li>\n</ol>",

However, expect that we will take our time with things, but also expect that what we do learn, we will learn it very well (I would prefer this pace as opposed to just breezing through material and half-learning it). I suggest that if we focus on a paper that is heavy on the CT but light on the prob/stat, that we supplement as many categorical ideas with those from prob/stat as possible (and vice versa). Since I have experience with CT, I would be able to tell how much CT background a specific paper requires, and since you have some prob/stats background, you'll be able to do something similar on your end (and similarly others who join). This will also help us isolate papers with less required background so that we can start with those.</p>",

I like the idea of deliberatively articulating the requisite concepts for papers. That should make it possible for people to seek supplemental readings and ask coherent background questions in places where they might get lost. Since everybody seems to agree that McCullaugh is a good place to start, that simplifies the issue of sifting through papers for ease. We can look for requisite concepts for McCullaugh that need explaining, and then find then check to see if there are better expositions in other papers. Also people are willing to go slow, we can devise exercises for ourselves to really flesh out the concepts––especially with an eye to clarifying how these concepts can contribute to applications that CT is especially suited for such as NLP, causal models, biostatistics, etc.</p>",

If so, I'm thinking we can do our first meeting on the 27th, so people have time to fit it into their schedules. This one will require little to no preparation. We'll just see who shows up and discuss some of what's been said here. I don't want to officially commit to reading any particular paper first until we've heard from the people who actually show up. Maybe there are better introductions to the topic, even if McCullough's paper is in everybody top five reading list. Then we can do first proper discussion meeting on the 11th. After that, we can decide whether people would prefer to do meetings every week or every other week. (My preference would be to do weekly meetings in July, but then scale back to every other week in August / September to accommodate many peoples' return to the Fall academic schedule, but we'll cross that bridge when we get there).</p>",

In my past reading groups, I've always had book exercises as a mechanism to reign people in. Clearly, this is a different situation. You are much more experienced with organizing meetings and you're good at it (you did a great job with Bradley's presentation, for example).</p>\n<p>I'll tell you what the first meeting's goals are and, if you have time, you can reciprocate with some concrete suggestions.</p>\n<p>This first meeting is just to discuss group goals / interests, order the papers in priorety, and decide what to read first. I'm hoping to keep the meeting to a maximum range of 1-2 hours.</p>\n<p>I was thinking of going through the abstracts or table of contents for each paper and asking people to write down and report any topics or headings that seem especially important to them. I would keep a tally of these to get a sense of peoples' interests and goals.</p>\n<p>Then I was thinking we'd try to build a consensus on which paper to tackle first.</p>\n<p>Finally, I if there's time, I was thinking that we'd try and pick out one important concept from our paper of choice to focus in on for the next meeting.</p>\n<p>I am also thinking of having people each briefly introduce themselves and explain their motivation for coming to the reading group, but I'm on the fence about this because I don't know how many \"talkers\" will attend. Maybe you have some advice on how to manage this and the above scenarios so things run smoothly?</p>\n<p>Finally, I've set up the sign-up process to ask people why they are interested in applying Category Theory to Statistics. I am planning to use these answers, and the tally from the first meeting to privately outline a rough roadmap of topics to cover. (Who shows up to later meetings will also impact this).</p>\n<p>Does this sound like a reasonable agenda?</p>\n<p>Can you forsee any problems that I should prepare for?</p>\n<p>Do you have other ideas about what I might do for this first meeting?</p>\n<p>As for future meetings, I'm hoping that each meeting will involve zeroing in on a specific concept from the paper and writing up brief notes on it, then deciding on the topic for the next meeting.

I would follow exactly those ideas, but also allocate an amount of time for them. I haven't signed up via the meetup, but maybe I should because I plan on attending. And maybe the meetings should only be accessible to those who have signed up? (To get those that are a bit more serious)<br>\nAs for co-organizing, I'd honestly prefer being one of the more active members than someone who helps with the organization. I can also advise. But yeah, I find the thought of being responsible for organizing is a bit stressful to me, so I'd prefer not to be an official part of that. <br>\nI wouldn't be too concerned about John's message/warning. If people drop out after the first meeting, that's fine. A reading/learning seminar can be haphazard, and that's honestly okay in my opinion. It's important not to stress yourself out. If you want, you can get some of the more serious participants (me, maybe Evan? etc) to help you out with a head start. For example, if we're discussing abstracts in the first meeting, some of us can volunteer to read them ahead of time and guide those discussions. (For example, I chose 5 papers for my top 5, and I can talk about why I chose those briefly).</p>",

        "content": "<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"296639\">@Arthur Parzygnat</span> thanks for the feedback. That all sounds perfectly reasonable. You're right about the attendance thing. In my experience, as many as 20 people can show up at the first meeting and then it can drop to as little as 2 or 3, even if everybody claims they had a great time. I'm not too worried about that. No big expectations here.</p>\n<p>Also, I think it's totally fine if people who don't sign up show up. I don't care about \"unserious\" people showing up. People self-filter. No need for exclusivity. Sometimes people just have different attitudes towards signups. In fact, I had one serious attendee who refused to make a meetup account the entire time, but he attended every week for months.</p>\n<p>As for the time limit idea, here's my concrete plan (these notes are as much for my reference as yours). For each abstract, and outline, I'll read it out loud to the group. As I do so, I'll ask people to write out a list of the highlights that stand out to them and post it on a thread in Zulip so I can review it later (that'll impose a natural time limit because we won't verbally discuss it). Then I'll ask people to list 3 articles they wouldn't mind starting with. Then we'll take like 5-15 minutes to pick one. Then we'll take 20 minutes to enumerate all the major concepts in that article and review the highlights people posted for it. We'll pick the first concept and assign a small number of pages for reading. We can save formal introductions for the second meeting, when the self-filtering has begun.</p>\n<p>Lastly, no worries about helping to organize. For me, it serves as a mechanism to keep me reading, but it's not everybody's cup of tea. I think if you (and as you mentioned, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"275965\">@Evan Patterson</span>, if he's willing, or anybody else who might volunteer) could take a look at the abstracts in advance, that would be very helpful though. For me, this first meeting will take place right before 2 exams and a final project in my final week of summer classes, so I'd prefer to keep my role purely to moderator until the next meeting. It would be very helpful if some people read ahead.</p>",

We also know that this construct is virtual, and not valid, because there are counter examples.</p>\n<p>For example, runners can get a second and third wind if they push past perceived exhaustion. More problematically, working on a project all day every day can be invigorating or exhausting depending on the psychological meaning of the situation to a person. However, even in this case, a person will eventually succumb to the need for sleep or distraction or both. Therefore, any refined theory will have to model semantic frames and get clearer about how to define the \"temperature\" of a person's motivational state (see * below for one possible refinement).</p>\n<p>If I was earnestly working on this problem, my overall approach would be to start with a naive overly precise model –– a resource theory. Then I would generalize to a manifold of resource theories. First, I would pick a manageable domain for my theory (a specific sport, the military, academia, etc). I would do some phenomenological research to figure out which dimensions are appropriate to include in my model. That is, I would (1) reflect on the issue, (2) I would gather a maximally variable set of cases of interest and (3) do multidimensional scaling surveys where I ask people to say how similar the different situations I've collected are, thereby extracting the dimensionality of the principal components. </p>\n<p>Next, I would generalize my theory to a manifold of dynamical descriptions. I would try to construct a qualitative transition diagram like the one Strogatz reproduces in his book Dynamical Systems and Chaois:<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/zu_LxVraTic6z2peMiTXen1K/MK1aC.gif\">MK1aC.gif</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/zu_LxVraTic6z2peMiTXen1K/MK1aC.gif\" title=\"MK1aC.gif\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/21317/zu_LxVraTic6z2peMiTXen1K/MK1aC.gif\"></a></div><p>but one that characterizes when people \"give up\" or change motivational states in other ways, with respect to the dimensions I constructed using multidimensional scaling. (Most likely, the model would be a dynamical system theory whose underlying quantities describe probabilities as well as aggregated states such as the \"temperature\" I described above, so it would be a highly layered model).</p>\n<p>Then I would use statistically appropriate empirical data––and anecdotal counterexamples––to look for discrepancies between my qualitative model of when people give up and when they actually give up. Then I would repeat for another domain, and another until I could convince some poor grad student that s/he should take up my cause <span aria-label=\"smiling devil\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f608\" role=\"img\" title=\"smiling devil\">:smiling_devil:</span></p>\n<p>Overall, by focusing on building a qualitative model of a class of \"models,\" or a class of classes of \"models,\" it's possible to build a model that is sufficiently ambiguous / qualitative to be true to the idea you are describing. It's a lot of work, which is why people rarely do it, but it's possible. At least, I have faith that it is possible in the same way that enlightenment natural philosophers such as Galileo had faith that the universe was 'rational.'</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think that scientists and statisticians need to get more serious about rigorizing this part of science. Right now, when I ask myself what is the right toolkit to solve that problem, I can't think of anything more likely than CT.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I couldn't agree more. In the above example, CT could make the process of making metaphors precise and extending models much more approachable than without CT.</p>\n<p>My hope is that Category Theory can be a secret tool (then, hopefully, a not-so-secret tool) for making these kinds of problems tractable. (there are probably a lot of problems with my off-the-cuff 'proposal' but you get the idea)</p>\n<p>[*] This is metaphor may be more literal than it seems. Georg Northoff has a theory of consciousness that quantitatively relates the phenomenology of mood to the variability of neural signals (as measured by EEG signals and fast magnetic imaging). Northoff identifies the prefrontal / orbitofrontal brain region as the source of perceptions about the outside world and he identifies  the thalimaco-parietal region with perceptions about the inner world. These relations are relative. For example, a person who has high neural variability in the prefrontal region and low variability in the thalimaco-parietal region would feel as if the world is moving \"too fast\" for them, causing the mood of depression. People with the reverse condition feel manic, even though their thoughts are disordered. So the metaphor of mood or motivation as \"temperature\" has a stronger foundation than you'd think at first glance.</p>",
