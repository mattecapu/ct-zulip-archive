She uses what we'd call monoidal categories, with the pentagon and other identities listed, but she calls them \"catégories AU\" and says she is following Neantro Saavedra-Rivano's thesis for her terminology.    She gives a date of 1970 with a question mark for that thesis, but the Mathematical Geneaology says it's 1972.   Saavedra-Rivano was another student of Grothendieck so she may have gotten the information before his thesis was done.</p>\n<p>She talks about</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\"<span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mo>⊗</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\otimes</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6667em;vertical-align:-0.0833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">⊗</span></span></span></span>-catégories\" which have a <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mo>⊗</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\otimes</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6667em;vertical-align:-0.0833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">⊗</span></span></span></span> functor obeying no laws,  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"catégories associative\" which are <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mo>⊗</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\otimes</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6667em;vertical-align:-0.0833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">⊗</span></span></span></span>-catégories with an associator obeying the pentagon identity</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"catégories AU\" which are monoidal categories</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"catégories AC\" which are <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mo>⊗</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\otimes</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6667em;vertical-align:-0.0833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">⊗</span></span></span></span>-categories with an associator obeying the pentagon identity and also a symmetry obeying the hexagon identity, and</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\"catégories ACU\" which are symmetric monoidal categories.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, it's a bit baroque by modern standards but all the definitions of these things are just what a modern mathematician would give.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Grothendieck began employing the term \"<span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mo>⊗</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\otimes</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6667em;vertical-align:-0.0833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">⊗</span></span></span></span>-catégories\" as early as late 1964/early 1965 when he embarked on developing the main lines of the theory of motives (see for example <a href=\"https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~leila.schneps/grothendieckcircle/motives.pdf\">https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~leila.schneps/grothendieckcircle/motives.pdf</a>) within the framework of tannakian categories (a name introduced by Saavedra). He initially referred to them as \"catégories tensorielles rigides\" and later as \"<span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mo>⊗</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\otimes</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6667em;vertical-align:-0.0833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">⊗</span></span></span></span>-catégories de Galois-Poincaré\". It is worth noting that he not only had knowledge of Bénabou's work but also coincidentally attended the defense of his thesis, as mentioned in a letter dated 15.2.1983 (<a href=\"https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~georges.maltsiniotis/ps/agrb_web.pdf\">https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~georges.maltsiniotis/ps/agrb_web.pdf</a>). The idea I would like to convey is that although Grothendieck did not introduce the concept himself, he was actively working with it in its early stages, well before his encounters with Sinh or Saavedra. It is interesting to mention that Manin uses the word \"monoidal\" in his 1968 paper \"Correspondences, motifs, and monoidal transformations, Mat. Sb. (N.S.) 77, 119 (1968), 475–507,\" but unfortunately, I was unable to find a copy of it (and it is in Russian).</p>",
