Later, once you've mastered a lot of the jargon and are digging deeper, you discover it has an annoyingly large number of theorems.  <span aria-label=\"upside down\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f643\" role=\"img\" title=\"upside down\">:upside_down:</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have never felt this in disciplines wherein one actually computes things. Take enumerative combinatorics as an extreme opposite case: there are certainly a lot of  concepts and terms, but at a basic level there are not many definitions to wade through for any particular sort of problem. If I want to enumerate all the Dyck paths of a certain size then <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number#Proof_of_the_formula\">there are quite a few ways to do it</a>, and perhaps some machinery to learn (say a generating function), but not a lot of concepts without associated machinery, results, or examples.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You don't think CT-ists actually compute things? </p>\n<p>I don't know about others, but I feel that I compute things all the time as I work in category theory. One example that came up not so long ago was to compute the set of natural transformations from one functor Vect --&gt; Set to another, where the first takes a vector space to its n-fold tensor power and the other was some other functor. \"Compute\" here means to characterize these things in simple concrete terms. For example, if the second functor is the same as the first here, then natural transformations are tantamount to (are in natural bijection with) elements of the group algebra of kS_n, where k is the ground field. </p>\n<p>If one's idea of computing or calculating is relegated to computing numbers, then I don't know what to say. That would be a limited meaning. I would naturally use the word \"compute\" to describe what I was doing, and wouldn't know what else to call it. I think a lot of category theorists engage in this sort of humble but honest activity, routinely.</p>",

I want to clarify these, because neither was or is the case. a) I think CT-ists don't compute many things <em>in</em> CT versus <em>using</em> CT, with Kan extensions being now an (or the) obvious counterexample. b) could be called a computation versus a characterization (not sure I would feel comfortable eliding such a distinction but OK), and it can clearly be encoded numerically: take a basis as a matrix, form its tensor powers, and encode the algebraic operations. But insofar as there is computation here, there isn't much of a CT-ish computational objective--it is a group-theoretical one, and the computations are only \"in\" CT insofar as the problem has been translated there: this strikes me as more fairly called \"using\" CT than \"in\" CT. Now it <em>is</em> a CT-ish objective to characterize this gizmo \"in\" CT, and you've done that by construction. Fair enough?</p>",
