I just found what I was looking for in Varadajan's book <em>Lie Groups, Lie Algebras and Their Representations</em>: he shows that if a Lie group G acts on a manifold X, every orbit is a manifold in its own right (injectively immersed in X, though not necessarily embedded).   </p>\n<p>So, suppose the lowest-dimensional manifold on which G acts nontrivially has dimension d.  Then G acts nontrivially on some orbit, which must also be a manifold, which must therefore also have dimension d.  So, G has a nontrivial <em>transitive</em> action on a manifold of dimension d.  So, the lowest-dimensional manifold on which G acts  nontrivially and <em>transitively</em> also has dimension d.  (Clearly it cannot be lower; we've just shown it's not more.)</p>\n<p>Another little fact: every transitive action of G on a manifold is isomorphic to its action on G/H  for some Lie subgroup H, and dim(G/H) = dim(G) - dim(H), so</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the lowest-dimensional manifold on which G acts nontrivially and transitively has dimension d</li>\n</ul>\n<p>iff</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the highest-dimensional proper Lie subgroup of G has dimension dim(G) - d.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Putting these facts together:</p>\n<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Given a Lie group G, the dimension of the lowest-dimensional manifold on which G acts nontrivially is dim(G) - dim(H), where H is a proper Lie subgroup of G of maximal dimension.</p>",
