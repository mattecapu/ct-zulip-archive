This one is the gentle category theory book - for people who want to learn category theory but don't have enough formal math background to read other category theory text books. Eg people whose degree is math-adjacent but not math, interested high school students...</p><span>- Dr Eugenia Cheng --no advice please-- (@DrEugeniaCheng)</span></div></div>",
