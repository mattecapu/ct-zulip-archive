There are 6 regular polytopes in 4 dimensions, two of which have five-fold symmetry, so you'd have to show those two can't be faces of regular polytopes in 5 dimensions.  It's also interesting to see why the 24-cell can't be the face of a regular polytope in 5 dimensions.    Then you'd have to show that the only way to use an n-cube, n-simplex or n-orthoplex to be the face of an (n+1)-dimensional regular polytope is to create an (n+1)-cube, (n+1)-simplex or (n+1)-orthoplex, respectively.   </p>\n<p>That'd be the \"naive\" proof strategy.  A fancier strategy would be to use the classification of Coxeter groups.  That might be easier!</p>",
