I thought, OK, that's pretty interesting and convenient way of describing knots.</p>\n<p>And then there was something about how a simple topological property about knots, represented in this weird tensor notation, turned out to be the Yang Baxter equation. <a href=\"https://www.christopheroei.com/s2/7363d819215d87a54b86360e8af0d70899fbd99322d371baa5bfdc90723c9e11.txt\">https://www.christopheroei.com/s2/7363d819215d87a54b86360e8af0d70899fbd99322d371baa5bfdc90723c9e11.txt</a></p>\n<p>It was the first time I'd ever seen anything like that, and my advisor and I were both scratching our heads. It seemed like there was something marvelous and profound about it, but I had no idea what it was. I left the physics world and got into computer science soon afterwards, and haven't thought about it much since then.</p>\n<p>And then yesterday I found <a href=\"https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/rosetta/rose3.pdf\">https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/rosetta/rose3.pdf</a></p>\n<p>I wish I'd heard of category theory earlier.</p>",
