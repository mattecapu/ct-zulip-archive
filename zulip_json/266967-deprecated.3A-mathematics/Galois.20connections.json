        "content": "<p>Two years ago, when I was still in Marseille, my supervisor relayed a message to the logic group, on which Girard was, about the \"World Logic Day\" which was created by a guy working on the subject of paraconsistent logic. And he didn't like this message. Soon after, I received a message on my mailbox, which was the reply of Girard. I've never received any other message like this in my life. He was talking about Trump, a terrorist organisation in Brazil composed of Japanese immigrants during World War II named Shindo Renmei (I had to do some research to understand his few phrases) and other people I didn't know much about. At the end, there was his moto in Latin (invented by him) that required one more time the help of Google (translate this time) to be understood.</p>\n<p>The only other day I've been more or less in contact with Girard was at the Linear Logic Winter School in 2022, also in Marseille. It was something like 5 days long but he didn't show up before the very last hour, for the final talk, by him. His talk was the only one in French, but hopefully it was indicated on the first slide that \"subtitles in English\" will appear on these slides during the talk. It was really interesting, the talk was mainly composed of political and philosophical considerations, with a bit of mathematics at times (when he emphasized that it was \"complicated mathematics\", naming a complicated topology, something like fidèlement-plat quasi compact topology with a lot of words but related to C*-algebras if I remember, but saying that he doesn't remember which one exactly it is). At the end someone asked what was the definition of logical scientism or something like this. He said a few words, but then suddenly stopped the talk saying that he was \"tired of hearing himself\". After that, the organizers told him that they can go outside if he doesn't feel well and he was still doing great gestures, wiping his forehead as if he was going to die etc...</p>\n<p>One of the most interesting point of the talk was when he said nonchalantly \"I've never said that\" and gave a little new idea. There was like 50 people in the room and I saw several of them (especially the most experienced people, with tenure, not the students who came to learn linear logic) taking a lot of notes and being trembling during two minutes. I really thought it was ridiculous, my method of doing research being mainly to walk in the parks and I'm always too lazy to even read completely the published papers which must be interesting for me. After the talk, I went to the library and I saw guys writing frenetically on the whiteboard trying to understand the few phrases of Girard containing this original content, I really thought there were ridiculous too. </p>\n<p>Since that time, I've read a bit about the history of science and it happens very often that people who do important things are comedians like this, so I'm no more surprised by this kind of comedy, when I see someone like this, I'm just thinking that it is something in nature that creativity his correlated with some special social behaviour in these persons and I'm just laughing. Also, I know that there are probably very important informations hidden in their words if you're able to decode.</p>\n<p>And I don't think that Girad will never go on this Zulip. First he hates category theory (most of the time, in some papers there was category theory but it was always written with co-authors) and secondly if you watch some of his pictures, you will understand, that he can't go on a place like this open to everyone. </p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/TYlyydALvc8wtFtqu1WgrU7R/jean-yves-girard.jpg\">jean-yves-girard.jpg</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/TYlyydALvc8wtFtqu1WgrU7R/jean-yves-girard.jpg\" title=\"jean-yves-girard.jpg\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/21317/TYlyydALvc8wtFtqu1WgrU7R/jean-yves-girard.jpg\"></a></div>",

The depth always seems to come in understanding the fixed points, or more critically in identifying whether the connection you have constructed is a shadow of a deeper connection between the two sides.</p>\n<p>I realise now that I never explained the title of the talk! Model theory is the study of set-theoretic semantics of formal theories. The early school of categorical logic comes from asking what we need to extract from sets to still find semantics of these theories. It might be stretching history a little, but the treatment of toposes via their internal logics can be motivated from a desire to expand set theory beyond its traditional axiomatization. Meanwhile, the theory of accessible and presentable categories comes from studying properties of the categories of models of these theories. So there's lots of precedent for taking ideas from model theory and seeing how they can be recovered in a categorical setting in order to subsequently expand upon them.</p>",
