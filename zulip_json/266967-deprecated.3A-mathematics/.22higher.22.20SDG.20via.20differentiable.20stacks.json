I'm especially interested by the possibility to get equivariance \"for free\" by taking quotient stacks. If I'm understanding it correctly, it seems possible to do some sort of higher analogue of SDG in differentiable stacks, perhaps via Coquand et al.'s work on stack semantics. I wonder if there are any references that go in this direction, or is my understanding wrong?</p>",
