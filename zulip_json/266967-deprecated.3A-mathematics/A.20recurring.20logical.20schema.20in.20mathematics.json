The definition of a BGB is constituted of two axioms: (1) compatibility (2) specialty. </p>\n<p>It happens that every BGB is a GB and the definition of a GB comprises 3 axioms: (1) compatibility, (3) associativity, (4) coassociativity.</p>\n<p>Thus the definition of BGB is equivalent to (1)+(2)+(3)+(4). It is a larger definition in the sense that (1)+(2) is syntactically strictly included in this definition.</p>\n<p>A class of examples of BGB is constituted by the SA. It turns out that to prove that every SA is a BGB, the only method I know and maybe the easiest one is first to prove that every SA verifies (3) and (4) and then use it to prove that it also verifies (1) and (2). So, finally, in practice, to prove that an object is an SA I must first prove that it verifies (3) and (4) which seemed to be \"consequences\" of the short definition of BGB to finally be able to prove that it verifies the short definition, but by proving the biggest package (1)+(2)+(3)+(4) and not only (1)+(2) which is annoying because I wanted to be able to use the short definition in the examples too.</p>\n<p>It seems to me that I have already encountered this schema many times: ie. when you need to prove that an example verifies consequences of a definition first to be able to prove that it verifies this definition. Do you have examples of this in your mind?</p>\n<p>Note that when I say \"consequence\", \"larger\" etc. it is in a syntactic way and closer to the sense we use in the everyday life, for example when we think of causality. Reasoning only in term of truth is insufficient to explain these \"logical\" things that happen in the mathematical practice because you need something finer and more syntactic that for example the idea of equivalence which says that two things are equivalent if and only if each time one is true, then the other one is true.</p>",
