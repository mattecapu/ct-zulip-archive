This series has sometimes been called the world's first blog, though it was originally  posted on a \"usenet newsgroup'' called sci.physics.research --- a form of communication that predated the world-wide web.  I began writing this series as a way to talk about papers I was reading and writing, and in the first 50 issues I stuck closely to this format.   These issues focus rather tightly on quantum gravity, topological quantum field theory, knot theory, and applications of <em>n</em>-categories to these subjects.    There are, however, digressions into elliptic curves, Lie algebras, linear logic and various other topics.</p>\n<p>Tim Hosgood kindly typeset all 300 issues of <em>This Week's Finds</em> in 2020. They will be released in six installments of 50 issues each.  I have edited the issues here to make the style a bit more uniform and also to change some references to preprints, technical reports, etc. into more useful arXiv links.  This accounts for some anachronisms where I discuss a paper that only appeared on the arXiv later.   </p>\n<p>The process of editing could have gone on much longer; there are undoubtedly many mistakes remaining.  If you find some, please contact me and I will try to fix them.</p>",
