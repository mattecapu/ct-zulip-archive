There is a cool analogy between predicate logic and concepts in virtual equipments that we use: <a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/Uwtm7hX5koE6gbEjyieZsGoQ/Screen-Shot-2022-10-24-at-3.39.04-PM.png\">Screen-Shot-2022-10-24-at-3.39.04-PM.png</a>. This syntax corresponds to virtual equipments + some universal properties, and next steps would be to explore syntax for monoidal closed equipments + duality involutions. </p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/Uwtm7hX5koE6gbEjyieZsGoQ/Screen-Shot-2022-10-24-at-3.39.04-PM.png\" title=\"Screen-Shot-2022-10-24-at-3.39.04-PM.png\"><img src=\"/user_uploads/21317/Uwtm7hX5koE6gbEjyieZsGoQ/Screen-Shot-2022-10-24-at-3.39.04-PM.png\"></a></div><p>I know several people on here are interested in double categories and formal category theory so I'm happy to discuss.</p>",
