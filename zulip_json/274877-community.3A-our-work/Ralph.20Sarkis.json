Out of those 4 days, around 1.5 days was spent on discovering the 2-dimensional syntax for relations described in <a href=\"https://richardblute.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/williams-novfest.mp4\">Christian's talk</a>. Every time I introduced a new piece of syntax, we spent a lot of time finding examples and asking simple questions before moving on, and by the end of the week, we were able to cover relations, composition of relations, implications, vertical and horizontal composition of implications. I am not sure what to think of the end result. On the one hand, he and I had fun exploring these ideas and I believe the graphical syntax definitely helped him throughout our work. On the other hand, on the last day, he was supposed to prepare a quick explanation of what he did during the week to share with other students who did a similar internship, but he told me he was not confident enough in his understanding of relations, so we switched to a more <strong>concrete</strong> subject.</p>\n<p>Let me give a bit more details. It was really hard for him to find examples and questions by himself. I think the main problem is that he is not used to abstract reasoning, and I think I was bad at pointing out the relevant patterns. For instance, whenever we dealt with composition of two relations, he had to draw the points in the colors and links between them before understanding (that's I think the main good point about the syntax: the points and links picture for a relation embeds well in the syntax). This was easier when dealing with relations between a set and itself, in particular, familial relationships (dad, cousin, grandparent, etc.) between humans and the usual orders on integers. I found he was not very enthusiastic about our findings, so I'd like to look for better examples of things to prove (for me, the best thing we have proved is that if a relation is reflexive, then it is dense, we had lots of examples of dense and non-dense relations and we figured out all dense ones were reflexive, so we showed the implication (very easily) graphically).</p>\n<p>TLDR: Teaching relations to a high school student is very hard, but I believe it is less hard when using a graphical syntax.</p>",

Basically i'm intrested in quantitative generalized algebraic theories with a special case being categories,mostly the use case being using  those structures as a way of knowledge representation and an architectural principle for AI.If there's any papers like that I would love to hear about them.</p>\n<p>Also,it feels validating that this whole combination of fuzziness and Theory B stuff is coming back into vogue when I was thinking about it for years :)</p>",

When I arrived in London, we started to look at Jack Liell-Cock and Sam Staton's recent <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09391\">ImP paper</a> with the goal to devise some graphical method of reasoning about imprecise probability, and we partially achieved this.</p>\n<p>First, we used the existing axiomatization of finite stochastic matrices (with the Kronecker product) on powers of <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">2</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">2</span></span></span></span> from his previous <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14701\">paper</a> with Robin, Mateo,  and Alexandra. The diagrams in that paper are understood as probabilistic circuits (carrying probabilistic bits). Then, we added vertical wires that would carry nondeterministic bits, we postulated axioms that would describe the interaction, and we showed how the diagrams we obtained precisely correspond to morphisms in the category <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">B</mi><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">I</mi><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">m</mi><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">P</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathbf{BImP}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6861em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathbf\">BImP</span></span></span></span></span>, a variant of <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">I</mi><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">m</mi><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">P</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathbf{ImP}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6861em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathbf\">ImP</span></span></span></span></span>, again restricting to powers of <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">2</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">2</span></span></span></span>.

For example, I had very little time to prepare an application to an MCF position in Paris, I got interviewed, and I got ranked (7/~10). People told me this is good outcome for a first go.
