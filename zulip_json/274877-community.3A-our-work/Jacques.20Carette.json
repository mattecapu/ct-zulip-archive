This recipe effectively constructs a computationally universal quantum programming language from two copies of Pi, the internal language of rig groupoids. The construction consists of Hughes' arrows. Thus answer positively the question whether a computational effect exists that turns reversible classical computation into quantum computation: the quantum effect. Measurements can be added by layering a further effect on top. Our construction also enables some reasoning about quantum programs (with or without measurement) through a combination of classical reasoning and reasoning about complementarity. </p>\n<p>with <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"301248\">@Chris Heunen</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"452564\">@Robin Kaarsgaard</span> and Amr Sabry. Quite a lot of the paper is <a href=\"https://github.com/JacquesCarette/QuantumPi\">implemented in Agda</a> - it is possible to run small QuantumPi programs as well as do reasoning on them.</p>\n<p>Rig categories seems to be popular right now, so here's one more item that uses them, along with a bunch of other categorical constructions.</p>",
