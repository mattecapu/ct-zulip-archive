Itâ€™s cool to see those issues in this setting: you need to know whether an integer function is representing a positive or negative slope before you can monoticize it or define its inverse. Contrast that with Cauchy reals, where you can roughly define the data of the inverse for an arbitrary sequence, but need to know that the sequence converges away from zero to prove that the inverse sequence converges.</p>",

Ideally I'd like something that explains in some depth why some properties are undecidable and what that means without using a ton of jargon, and how it differs from proving a property/knowing from a proof that the property holds.
