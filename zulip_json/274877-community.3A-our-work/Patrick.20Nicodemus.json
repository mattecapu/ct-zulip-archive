I am a research mathematician interested in category theory and its applications in the theory of programming languages and in homological algebra.</p>\n<p>I have finished this paper on fibrations between bicategories I am working on and I'm ready to submit it to the Arxiv modulo proofreading for typos. Can someone from this forum please endorse me to upload PDF's to the Arxiv? I will post the paper here so you can see what I am trying to upload. You don't have to post here in the thread publicly, just DM me so I can send you my referral code.<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/GfEFIXRxnP2m7rmkyU65Bw_n/fibrations_between_bicategories.pdf\">fibrations_between_bicategories.pdf</a></p>",

I think that the arXiv's automated tooling for picking up submissions that don't fit the arXiv's standards does do checks for things like: is there a bibliography? is there an abstract? is it formatted (approximately) like a research paper? And people expect such a thing, so it would help get better traction for your paper. The arXiv metadata will ask for an abstract, so write one now and put it in the paper! Best of luck. At a very first glance, the thing looks nice, but I haven't had even a cursory read, I haven't time right now</p>",
