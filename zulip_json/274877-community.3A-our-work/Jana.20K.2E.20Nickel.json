Below is the code of the first composite of the equation that I mentioned. The parameters in [] set the unit lengths. The first draw command draws the boundaries. The second draw commands draws the labels in the middle of the cells.</p>\n<p>\\begin{tikzpicture}[x=1.6em, y=1.6em, font=\\scriptsize]<br>\n    \\draw   (0,2) -- (1,2) -- (1,3) -- (0,3) -- (0,1) -- (1,0) -- (2,0) -- (3,1) -- (3,3) -- (2,3) -- (2,2) -- (3,2) (0,1) -- (3,1);<br>\n    \\draw    (1.5,0.5) node {c}<br>\n            (1.5,1.5) node {$\\phi_n'$}<br>\n            (1.5,2.5) node[xshift=.75pt] {$\\dotsb$}<br>\n            (2.5,2.5) node {cc};                            <br>\n\\end{tikzpicture}</p>",
