You're right that a decent number of the theories are actually 2-categorical. These theories have a nice property: they always give a (pseudo) double category of models, rather than merely a virtual one. But we also consider quite a few theories that aren't of this form. One that I like quite a bit is the \"theory of promonoids\" (Theory 6.8), whose (lax) models are multicategories. This theory isn't \"2-categorical,\" although one might say that it is \"bi-categorical.\" For an example using everything available in a double theory, see Theories 6.11 and 6.12, whose models are (symmetric) monoidal copresheaves. This example is extended further in Theory 6.15.</p>",

At one point I looked through these slides enough to convince myself that it was an appreciably different story,  although there are certainly similarities too. I agree that it would be helpful to include a comparison in the paper.</p>\n<p>As I understand it, Pare's story is related to the one that <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"275899\">@Christian Williams</span> has been telling in his own thread: the double category Rel suggests the interpretation that objects of a double category are types, arrows are terms, proarrows are predicates/relations/judgments, and cells are implications/inferences. The models of such a theory (strict or strong functors into Rel) feel \"one-dimensional\" in that they are like models of an algebraic theory but also allow the specification of relations and implications between those. Looking at <em>lax</em> functors into Span, or equivantly unitary/normal lax functors into Prof, has big consequences: it ensures that all the objects in the theory become categories and hence that models are objects of the expected two-dimensional structure. The cells of this structure are modulations, which crucially use the laxators to recover natural transformations.</p>\n<p>This makes me wonder what kind of cells Pare is using in his double category of models. I will have to look more closely, but perhaps they are modifications between vertical and horizontal transformations? If so, you're looking at a double category of models that has different proarrows and different cells, hence is overall quite different.</p>",

One notable exception is that it seems <em>not</em> to include Markov categories. The reason is that Markov categories do something that is arguably not very categorical: they specify a not-necessarily-natural transformation, namely the family of copying operations. By contrast, in a model of double theory, all transformations are automatically natural. Now usually that's a feature, but in this case it's an obstruction! I find this mismatch quite annoying because in a different strand of my work, I have used Markov categories heavily.</p>\n<p>As for the other direction in the hierarchy, while I have a pretty good feeling that there should be ways to extend this formalism to cover more expressive doctrines, the doctrines that people typically associate with categorical logic, I don't know for sure how to do it and my ideas are currently quite vague. So I guess we'll have to see what happens. I hoping that other people will have ideas too.</p>",

Perhaps there are difficulties with the coherence conditions that I don't anticipate, so I don't assert fully that this is a definite theorem but it should be true.<br>\nAnyway.<br>\nConsider the 2-category Cat. A pseudo double category is a \"bicategory internal to Cat\", although apparently the term is pseudocategory, which is fine.<br>\nThere's a 2-categorical slice category Cat/Set, whose objects are categories C equipped with a functor C -&gt; Set. 1-cells are triangles that commute up to a lax natural transformation. 2-cells are natural transformations commuting with the triangles. This can be seen as a kind of 2-categorical grothendieck construction for the representable 2-presheaf Hom_{Cat}(-, Set).<br>\nOf course it is fibred over Cat by the forgetful functor.</p>\n<p>I now claim that for a pseudocategory C in Cat,  lax functors C -&gt; Span are in one to one correspondence with lifts of the pseudocategory structure C along the forgetful functor Cat/Set -&gt; Cat.<br>\nMoreover there is a 2-presheaf on (double categories, lax functors, horizontal natural transformations), or Pseudocat(Cat)<br>\n which sends each pseudocategory C to the category whose objects are \"extensions of C to a category structure C -&gt; Set\"<br>\nand this 2-presheaf is represented by the double category of spans.</p>\n<p>This claim is basically 2-categorical in nature and makes sense in defining the \"pseudocategory of spans\" internal to any 2-category, not just Cat. I posted about this in an earlier thread but I've developed my thoughts more.</p>",

If the double category admits all companions, this defines an auto-equivalence of the tight category, after which one continues with your argument.</p>\n<p>Of course, a drawback of this definition is that one only obtains a functorial assignment of duals on the tight category when the double categories admits companions/conjoints. However, all the obvious examples of compact closed double categories (e.g. those mentioned in the blog post) satisfy this assumption, so perhaps this is not a significant restriction.</p>",
