Here we categorify the splitting principle and generalize it to the context of 2-rigs. A 2-rig is a kind of categorified \"ring without negatives\", such as a category of vector bundles with ⊕ as addition and ⊗ as multiplication. Technically, we define a 2-rig to be a Cauchy complete k-linear symmetric monoidal category where k has characteristic zero. We conjecture that for any suitably finite-dimensional object r of a 2-rig R, there is a 2-rig map E:R→R′ such that E(r) splits as a direct sum of finitely many \"subline objects\" and E has various good properties: it is faithful, conservative, essentially injective, and the induced map of Grothendieck rings K(E):K(R)→K(R′) is injective. We prove this conjecture for the free 2-rig on one object, namely the category of Schur functors, whose Grothendieck ring is the free λ-ring on one generator, also known as the ring of symmetric functions. We use this task as an excuse to develop the representation theory of affine categories - that is, categories enriched in affine schemes - using the theory of 2-rigs.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Ames, Joe Moeller, Paulo Tabuada</p>\n<p>Lyapunov's theorem provides a fundamental characterization of the stability of dynamical systems. This paper presents a categorical framework for Lyapunov theory, generalizing stability analysis with Lyapunov functions categorically. Core to our approach is the set of axioms underlying a setting for stability, which give the necessary ingredients for “doing Lyapunov theory'' in a category of interest. With these minimal assumptions, we define the stability of equilibria, formulate Lyapunov morphisms, and demonstrate that the existence of Lyapunov morphisms is necessary and sufficient for establishing the stability of flows. To illustrate these constructions, we show how classical notions of stability, e.g., for continuous and discrete time dynamical systems, are captured by this categorical framework for Lyapunov theory. Finally, to demonstrate the extensibility of our framework, we illustrate how enriched categories, e.g., Lawvere metric spaces, yield settings for stability enabling one to “do Lyapunov theory'' in enriched categories.</p>",

Besides the classical continuous and discrete time settings, we also talk a bit about quantale-enriched categories (generalizing from Lawvere metric spaces) in the first paper, and labeled transition systems in the second paper. We have a few other examples that only get interesting in the asymptotic case, which we have worked out, but are writing a separate paper for. </p>\n<p>Interestingly, we can write down examples that are non-deterministic/stochastic etc, but the definitions force us to only consider deterministic behaviors of those. My gut says something influencing this is the fact that our very first assumption is that we have a cartesian category, and maybe redoing things in a Markov category would result in something interesting. If anybody has thoughts, I'd love to talk.</p>\n<p>A stone unturned is finding an example of a quantale Q for which the category of Q-enriched categories admits an endofunctor whose coalgebras are particularly interesting. As soon as we have such an example in hand, we have already proved a Lyapunov theorem for it. Again, if anybody has any ideas, I'd love to talk.</p>",

So I was talking about categorical Lyapunov, but including some new work that's not public yet: hybrid systems and control systems.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Is there something happening like a double operadic approach to layered control? In <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18329\">Towards a double operadic theory of systems</a> the authors stress the importance of using the tight direction, so maps between systems, for reasons which include representing \"Lyapunov and control-barrier functions which witness certain properties of the behavior of systems\". This tallies with <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15276\">Categorical Lyapunov theory I: stability of flows</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Lyapunov functions can be viewed as a map from the dynamical system to the “simplest” stable system.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You'd think it would be useful to look at both ways around the double category's squares: operadically compose subsystems and then map via Lyapunov function to a simple stable system, and map subsystems via Lyapunov functions to simple stable systems and then operadically compose.</p>\n<p>There's work on <a href=\"https://www.math.uni-bremen.de/zetem/cms/media.php/279/SFB637-A5-08-007-IC.pdf\">Stability of Interconnections of ISS Systems</a>. But some kind of wiring diagram approach would be interesting.</p>\n<p>Something relevant is envisaged in future work in the DOTS paper:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Explore <em>assume-guarantee</em> reasoning and compositional system validation using <em>slice</em> systems theories. Since maps between systems not only represent behaviors of those systems but also can express the satisfaction of certain properties (for example, Lyapunov functions [AMT25] which witness stability), we can form <em>certified systems theories</em> as slices (comma objects) in the 2-category of systems theories. Compositionality within these certified systems theories gives a form of <em>assume-guarantee</em> reasoning, or compositional model checking.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Is there any connection here with your approach?</p>",

In some recent work that isn't public yet, we use charts as a base category for thinking about hybrid systems, a first step in the correction of layered control. And in some work in progress, we essentially use lenses to talk about control systems. I think your suggestion of how to use operadic composition is interesting. We've recently been working on using sheaves for something similar, but I like operads a lot, so I'll think about how they're connected. Honestly, the control community is catching up to 1-categories right now. So if I were to write something explicitly using double categories for that crowd, it would have to be a very strong result.</p>",

I was taken aback by the incredible flexibility in the definition of a category, particularly with regards to morphisms. Somehow I wanted morphisms to \"be\" something appropriate, and I remember in frustration writing out a set something like <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy=\"false\">{</mo><mi>a</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>l</mi><mi>e</mi><mo separator=\"true\">,</mo><mi>b</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>a</mi><mo separator=\"true\">,</mo><mi>m</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>g</mi><mi>o</mi><mo stretchy=\"false\">}</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\{apple, banana, mango\\}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mopen\">{</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">a</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.01968em;\">ppl</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">e</span><span class=\"mpunct\">,</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.1667em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">banana</span><span class=\"mpunct\">,</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.1667em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">man</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.03588em;\">g</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">o</span><span class=\"mclose\">}</span></span></span></span> and trying to see if I could make a category where those were the morphisms.

How do you motivate early on in such a course the utility of realizing that some structures they've learned about are categories, or some constructions are functors. That fact on its own can be of interest to a mathematician, but an engineer wants practical payoffs. I don't think it even has to be significant, they just need something more than \"this thing is a functor\". In Emily Riehl's book, she gives a proof of Brouwer's fixed point theorem in the section on functoriality. This is the sort of thing I'm looking for, except that I'm specifically avoiding all homotopy at this stage.</p>",

That fact on its own can be of interest to a mathematician, but an engineer wants practical payoffs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I believe we should deliver ourselves from such worries, and approach the problem from a different perspective.</p>\n<p>Yours is probably <em>the</em> question for mathematics, not just category theory. Engineering fares quite well without advanced mathematics already, as a quick tour of Rome can testify. Most of engineering has traditionally been, and mostly still is, empirical: we try building something and see how it fares. Even with advanced mathematical models, the standard practice is often to build practical models and test them, rather than model them <em>in silico</em>. That is, engineering is an <em>inductive</em> endeavour first and foremost.</p>\n<p>Rather, the main role of mathematics is that of guidance, understanding, and communication. Why do we build in a certain way? How do I approach a problem? How do I motivate a certain solution? These are all <em>mathematical</em> questions, in my opinion, since they require a rigorous hygiene of thought and a certain deal of self-reflection, as well as the cultivation of a shared library of motifs to recognize and return to. Clearly, some mathematical tools have also a more immediate practical worth, enabling computation for instance that would not be possible otherwise---but it's important to realize that's the exception rather than the rule.</p>\n<p>Category theory has proven to be an extraordinarily successful language for mathematics, in the sense that so many ideas, structures, and patterns can be expressed <em>meaningfully</em> in terms of category theory, which is receptive and fertile (in a way that e.g. set theory is not). It is receptive in the sense that many fields can be reformulated categorically, and it is fertile since such reformulations are not lifeless encodings but categorical concepts prove salient for them.</p>\n<p>Category theory is stubbornly resistant to being dismissed as a clever trick to apply in some situations, rather than being used as a wise philosophy to apply consistently. It teaches some really useful problem solving skills.<br>\nThe relative point of view forces us to take mathematical objects honestly and makes us realize the biases and the unsubstantiated beliefs we approach them with. It also invites to think interoperably, to declutter abstractions, and to patiently attend to our language primitives.<br>\nThus, rather than parade 'killer applications',  I think we should reject that frame and communicate the actual value of category theory, and mathematics at large.</p>",

That fact on its own can be of interest to a mathematician, but an engineer wants practical payoffs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I believe we should deliver ourselves from such worries, and approach the problem from a different perspective.</p>\n<p>Yours is probably <em>the</em> question for mathematics, not just category theory. Engineering fares quite well without advanced mathematics already, as a quick tour of Rome can testify. Most of engineering has traditionally been, and mostly still is, empirical: we try building something and see how it fares. Even with advanced mathematical models, the standard practice is often to build practical models and test them, rather than model them <em>in silico</em>. That is, engineering is an <em>inductive</em> endeavour first and foremost.</p>\n<p>Rather, the main role of mathematics is that of guidance, understanding, and communication. Why do we build in a certain way? How do I approach a problem? How do I motivate a certain solution? These are all <em>mathematical</em> questions, in my opinion, since they require a rigorous hygiene of thought and a certain deal of self-reflection, as well as the cultivation of a shared library of motifs to recognize and return to. Clearly, some mathematical tools have also a more immediate practical worth, enabling computation for instance that would not be possible otherwise---but it's important to realize that's the exception rather than the rule.</p>\n<p>Category theory has proven to be an extraordinarily successful language for mathematics, in the sense that so many ideas, structures, and patterns can be expressed <em>meaningfully</em> in terms of category theory, which is receptive and fertile (in a way that e.g. set theory is not). It is receptive in the sense that many fields can be reformulated categorically, and it is fertile since such reformulations are not lifeless encodings but categorical concepts prove salient for them.</p>\n<p>Category theory is stubbornly resistant to being dismissed as a clever trick to apply in some situations, rather than being used as a wise philosophy to apply consistently. It teaches some really useful problem solving skills.<br>\nThe relative point of view forces us to take mathematical objects honestly and makes us realize the biases and the unsubstantiated beliefs we approach them with. It also invites to think interoperably, to declutter abstractions, and to patiently attend to our language primitives.<br>\nThus, rather than parade 'killer applications',  I think we should reject that frame and communicate the actual value of category theory, and mathematics at large.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is interesting, I agree with it, and I don't think it's hitting the point I'm thinking about. Let me try to pick apart things to find the distinction.</p>\n<p>I think these students have accepted that mathematics is useful. I think they have even on some level accepted that category theory is useful. If for no other reason, then at least because Aaron Ames is a bigshot, their boss, and likes category theory. Something being abstractly useful to some people doesn't mean that it's a good use of your time to learn it. So I could imagine students dropping off if they don't get a bit of meat once in a while. </p>\n<p>I'm a category theorist, but this is a downstream effect of being the sort of person who is fundamentally motivated by trying to understand in a visceral way <em>why</em> things are true. So for me, particularly while learning CT for the first time, statements like \"look at how all these different things are functors\" or whatever is a piece of meat for me. It's just not for them, but abstraction as a value is not the problem. I pointed to Brouwer's as an example that would have been good in a slightly different situation. Saying that a bunch of stuff has a property isn't good enough until I can show one way that that property was useful for one thing. </p>\n<p>After you know a bunch of category theory, you know that functoriality feeds into a million other structures and properties, and adds up to grand edifices that eventually solve problems, or clarify things. I'm looking for a thing to say in the lecture introducing functors, but before natural transformations that makes the notion of functor feel active.</p>",

Probably this is best motivated through many examples then: CT is useful precisely because it is able to host so many disciplines, and supercharges your ability to make connections and build up complexity. The last point is also another common 'pitfall': CT elementary concepts and examples rarely instantiate immediately to something fantastic, rather they require some fair amount of labour, and the most interesting results often dip toes in many different disciplines, so it's hard to give 'toy applications' in a laboratory setting.

Then introduce monoidal categories, string diagrams, internal co/monoids, Fox's theorem, Eckmann-Hilton argument. Then just give a taste of each of categorical probability, categorical quantum computation, and categorical systems theory.</p>\n<p>This outline leaves out a ton of basic theory, but I think that might just be the right approach with non-math majors.
