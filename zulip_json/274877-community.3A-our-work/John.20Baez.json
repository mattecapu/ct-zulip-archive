I also want to see if we can simplify the proofs using some ideas of <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"276777\">@Mike Shulman</span>.

Brendan Fong wanted me to give a broad programmatic talk instead of a technical one, so I decided to really throw caution to the winds and talk about the future of pure mathematics, applied category theory and climate change, and how they all fit together!  I still need to polish it up...

In this one I don't talk about the octonions, just the puzzle of <em>what structure is preserved by the Standard Model gauge group</em>.  I'm busy struggling to write the second talk, which is about using the exceptional Jordan algebra, and some other Jordan algebras, to make this structure more \"conceptual\".    I've had to do some last-minute research to pull this talk together.

Once I had the abstract construction written down, I found other examples, but until now I haven't seen an example where I was really convinced that the abstract point of view offered a significant simplification (taking that example alone) over just doing stuff by hand.  And this one doesn't even just use the construction itself, but also the fact that it's <em>functorial</em> (to deduce an equivalence between double categories of structured/decorated cospans from a simpler-to-construct equivalence of monoidal fibrations), which originally was something I included just because I was a category theorist and thought it was important in principle that everything is a functor, rather than because I had really convincing examples demanding it.</p>",

doesn't need to tell you which coordinates you're using.   It's not a good notation for when you're changing coordinates every ten seconds - for example, when the right side of an equation is using different coordinates than the left side!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Let me see if this makes sense (suppose we fixed a chart and we are talking there): since we have 2 dimensions, to specify a derivative I need to give you 2 components (since a derivative is now a vector in a 2-dimensional space).

Besides being evident from the graphs in part 5, this can be seen from the form of the conserved momentum: in integral form, momentum in an interval is equal to the difference in height of its endpoints.  Combined with the fact that bumps get higher when they merge, this kind of explains the lopsided distribution of subtree sizes observed in the blog comments.</p>\n<p>In fact, it seems that new bumps, or at least the really robust ones, are born from an instability of deep valleys; wavyness in shallow valleys tends to not have time to coalesce into a nice well-defined bump before it gets drawn into or crushed between existing ones.  Maybe rather than an absolute \"bumps only merge once born\" it's more of a thresholdy thing where the probability of an upward disturbance merging versus vanishing some other way has an S-shaped distribution based on its current magnitude.</p>",

We started this solution off with random initial data.   All solutions approach the inertial manifold exponentially fast - that's the definition of an inertial manifold.

It's being run by Jacob Foster.   The idea:</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All known intelligent systems are collectives. Individual organisms are collectives of cells, which develop, heal, sense, and act. Groups of human and non-human animals use a range of mechanisms to coordinate their behavior across space and time, from flocks and swarms to organizations, institutions, and cultural traditions. Deep learning — the dominant approach to artificial intelligence — gains its power from combining simple units into complex architectures; many contemporary architectures (e.g., GANs) combine multiple learners, and multi-agent settings are a critical research frontier for AI, especially settings that integrate human and artificial agents.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These examples imply that a scientific understanding of intelligence must fundamentally grapple with collective intelligence — in a much broader sense than typical usage of the term would suggest. A variety of mathematical and computational models have been developed to explain and design intelligent behavior in particular collectives. Several mathematical fields source the ideas used to build and understand these models, from dynamical systems, statistical mechanics, network science, and random matrix theory to information theory, optimization, Bayesian statistics, and game theory — even applied category theory, in recent years. It remains unclear, however, whether we have the right mathematical language to provide a unified, abstract account of collective intelligence — or whether such a language is even possible! This workshop will bring together leading experts who study and model collective intelligence, as well as those who seek to understand such models. Its goal is to explore the advantages and disadvantages of existing modeling frameworks; to find collective implementations of models of individual cognition; to expand the systems and settings understood as manifesting collective intelligence; and to grow the community of researchers who study the mathematical foundations of collective intelligence.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Having lectured or organized events at both campus, I'm inclined to be open to either, have would suggested whichever is best with respect to amenities such as the on-campus lodging for instructors/TAs, catering, videorecording support, transportation access for visitors (such as ourselves!), access by other CANMOD-affiliated researchers at SFU, and good projection and black/whiteboards and -- of course -- room availability.   There are also some financial matters in terms of support for student time (primarily Xiaoyan) to aid in creation of example models.</p>\n<p>I'll keep you posted on this front and welcome any questions or raising of issues to be considered, but with the first order logistical issues out of the way, I think that we can now focus our efforts on where they are rightly due: On preparation of quality plans and materials for the event.</p>\n<p>Thanks so much for your enablement of this event!</p>\n<p>Sincerely,<br>\nNathaniel Osgood</p>\n</blockquote>",

As a step toward answering this, André Weil proposed a series of conjectures that include a simplified version of the Riemann Hypothesis in which the meaning of the zeros becomes somewhat easier to understand.  Grothendieck and others worked for decades to prove Weil's conjectures, inventing a large chunk of modern algebraic geometry in the process.  This quest, still in part unfulfilled, led Grothendieck to dream of \"motives\": mysterious building blocks that could explain the zeros (and poles) of Weil's analogue of the Riemann zeta function.  This talk by a complete amateur will try to sketch some of these ideas in ways that other amateurs can enjoy.</p>\n</blockquote>",

As a step toward answering this, André Weil proposed a series of conjectures that include a simplified version of the Riemann Hypothesis in which the meaning of the zeros becomes somewhat easier to understand. Grothendieck and others worked for decades to prove Weil's conjectures, inventing a large chunk of modern algebraic geometry in the process. This quest, still in part unfulfilled, led Grothendieck to dream of \"motives\": mysterious building blocks that could explain the zeros (and poles) of Weil's analogue of the Riemann zeta function. This talk by a complete amateur will try to sketch some of these ideas in ways that other amateurs can enjoy.</p>\n</blockquote>",

We explain this framework and illustrate it with the example of stock and flow diagrams. These diagrams are widely used in epidemiology to model the dynamics of populations. Although tools already exist for building these diagrams and simulating the systems they describe, we have created a new software package called StockFlow which uses decorated cospans to overcome some limitations of existing software. Our approach cleanly separates the syntax of stock and flow diagrams from the semantics they can be assigned. We have implemented a semantics where stock and flow diagrams are mapped to ordinary differential equations, although others are possible. We illustrate this with code in StockFlow that implements a simplified version of a COVID-19 model used in Canada. This is joint work with Xiaoyan Li, Sophie Libkind, Nathaniel Osgood and Evan Patterson.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Ways of transferring ideas between settings like this seem so cool to me!</p>\n<p>(Oh, and I now have learned what the dimension of a representation is, I think!

I don't like this - would someone say that for a paper on number theory?    But I added an application.   I doubt it will convince a skeptic that this beautiful theorem is \"worthwhile\".   I was trying to motivate it by its inherent beauty.   I already said it hasn't found enough applications yet, probably because not  enough people know about it.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>FWIW, the tight completion that we get as the nucleus of the isbell duality is the <em>concept category</em>, i.e. the spectral space of whatever data source the original category captured. this is an application that solves the problem of amplification (\"echo chambers\") which is built-in into the linear (SVD) approach to concept mining. so this application applies the isbell duality to each of your tweets about it when the IR engine decides who to display it to :)</p>\n<p>i gave an overview for logicians around xmas 2021 with these slides:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/fep8h6rmcl6bcdf/0-CCA-talk.pdf?dl=0\">https://www.dropbox.com/s/fep8h6rmcl6bcdf/0-CCA-talk.pdf?dl=0</a><br>\n(the talk was recorded and it might be on youtube...)</p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_ref\"><a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/fep8h6rmcl6bcdf/0-CCA-talk.pdf?dl=0\" title=\"0-CCA-talk.pdf\"><img src=\"https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/4e6a42a0ea7686feb2e70442a53be9c49b21cc6a/68747470733a2f2f7777772e64726f70626f782e636f6d2f7374617469632f6d6574617365727665722f7374617469632f696d616765732f737065637472756d2d69636f6e732f67656e6572617465642f636f6e74656e742f636f6e74656e742d7064662d6c617267652e706e67\"></a><div><div class=\"message_inline_image_title\">0-CCA-talk.pdf</div><desc class=\"message_inline_image_desc\"></desc></div></div>",

However, category theory is now being applied to wide range of new subjects: physics, chemistry, epidemiology, natural language processing, game theory, project management, and many more. This raises new questions about what category theory can do, and where it will go next. We shall try to provide some answers — but more importantly, try to stimulate some productive conversations.</p>",

Again we are lucky enough to have an excellent set of speakers:</p>\n<p>Denjoe O'Connor  -  (On exceptional fuzzy spaces and octonions) <br>\nShogo Tanimura  -  (On superselection)<br>\nJohn Baez  -  (On getting to the bottom of Noether's theorem)<br>\nAiyalam Balachandran  -  (On Gauss' Law:  A tale)<br>\nL Glaser  -  (On reconstructing manifolds from truncated spectral triples)<br>\nJohn Huerta  -  (On the algebra of grand unified theories)<br>\nKasia Rejzner  -  (On quantization, dequantization, and distinguished states) <br>\nLev Vaidman  -  (On many worlds)</p>\n<p>For dates and times, please go to <a href=\"https://furey.space\">https://furey.space</a></p>\n<p>Talks will run about once every three weeks on Mondays.  The times will most often be 18:00 Berlin time, but this varies quite a bit due to the accommodation of time zones.</p>\n<p>You can help us out by circulating this announcement in your favourite physics and math departments.  In particular, please forward this announcement to your international colleagues outside of Europe and North America.  The beauty of zoom is that it gives researchers direct access to each other, largely regardless of distance, regardless of their country's finances, and without excessively polluting the planet.</p>\n<p>Finally, if you know of researchers or students wanting to be added to the mailing list, please advise them to email me at <a href=\"mailto:nichol@aims.ac.za\">nichol@aims.ac.za</a></p>\n<p>Looking forward to seeing you soon,</p>\n<p>Nichol Furey<br>\nInstitut für Physik<br>\nHumboldt-Universität zu Berlin</p>\n</blockquote>",

I like the unusual requirements:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On behalf of the Santa Fe Institute and our president, David Krakauer, and chair of the Community Lecture Committee, Jessica Flack, I am pleased that you have agreed to deliver a talk in Santa Fe as part of our community lecture series.</p>\n<p>As you know, you will present a lecture titled “Visions for the Future of Physics” on Tuesday, October 18th at 7:30pm at the Lensic Theater. Our usual format for these evening lectures is as follows:</p>\n<p>• An introduction and context setting by an SFI scientist.</p>\n<p>• Five-minute personal narrative that outlines your story and how you got into your field (to give the audience – especially our younger viewers – some personal context on who you are and how you got to where you are now).</p>\n<p>• Forty-minute talk on a topic of your choice (remember this is for a lay audience so try to avoid too many technical terms or long mathematical proofs).</p>\n<p>• Followed by a 10-15 minute conclusion where the speaker presents a reckless idea (one that is either a bit out-there, forward looking, or one that is not fully developed). The reckless idea format can vary from speaker to speaker but should leave the audience excited for the future of your creative inquiry.</p>\n<p>SFI would very much like our visitors to interact with the residential community by means of scientific collaborations as well as more informally at lunch and tea, and thus we expect visitors to spend the majority of their time on site. Please provide us as soon as possible with your provisional dates. If there are faculty members with whom you would like to meet during your visit, just let me know. We will send you an agenda in the days before your lecture.</p>\n<p>We may request a few brief interviews with local news media. This extends the community outreach benefit of the lecture and helps ensure a full auditorium. These interviews typically include a 20 to 30 minute phone interview with local radio or newspaper reporters.</p>\n<p>In addition, we will request slides and background materials a week or two in advance of the lecture. The lecture may be broadcast live on our YouTube page and our communications team may be live on Twitter during the event.</p>\n</blockquote>",

(the main reason to not read a commissioned handbook or britannica is that they iron out the voices of the people who wrote it.) --- this is not a matter of beauty or comfort, but of the \"flow\" of a theme, like in music... understanding does not come from piling up correct statements, but from weaving the ideas as they associate with one another. (that is why we make sentences. where a human grandmother says \"world is full of dangers\", a meerkat grandmother says \"hawk, dog, snake, poisonous weed\".)</p>\n<p>so to be honest, i would prefer if you don't insert corrections but maybe add them somewhere. most errors are not random but carry useful information. error-free text and \"authoritative sources\" are the building blocks of religion, not science...</p>\n<p>when i teach, i actually not only leave in the mistakes that i once made, but often add the new ones deemed interesting. at the beginning i announce that students get points for submitting correct answers or for finding mistakes in the questions and in the lecture notes. (i started doing this with the graduate classes in security protocols: you can ace the exam by proving that a protocol is secure or by finding an attack. including the exam protocol...)</p>\n<p>everyone finds mistakes in the wikipedia pages and for things that i know about, they are the most valuable part: what are the rough edges of this or that idea?...</p>",

This functor F can be seen as a model of the theory whose syntactic category is Rep(G).   </p>\n<p>We can generalize this idea while making it more precise by thinking of groups as giving commutative Hopf algebras and principal bundles as torsors.   We can then define a new general concept of 'torsor' of a commutative Hopf algebra, as follows.  </p>\n<p>Choose a field k and consider the doctrine of symmetric monoidal cocomplete k-linear categories.   For any commutative Hopf algebra H, the category of comodules of H is a theory in this doctrine.   We then define a 'torsor' of H to be a model of this theory.</p>\n<p>We can further generalize this by working with commutative Hopf algebroids over k, which give a certain notion of 'stack' simultaneously generalizing the concept of 'space' associated to a commutative k-algebra (namely an affine scheme over k) and the notion of 'group' associated to a commutative Hopf algebra over k (namely an affine group scheme over k).</p>\n<p>Returning to the Hopf algebra case, let's do an example.   Given a finite group G we get a commutative Hopf algebra H = k^G so we can talk about a torsor of H, defined as above.  We call this a 'G-torsor over k'.   </p>\n<p>Unraveling the definitions, a G-torsor over k is a symmetric monoidal colimit-preserving k-linear functor F:  Rep(G) → C where C is some symmetric monoidal cocomplete k-linear category.   We can even describe this more explicitly.</p>\n<p>Bringing it down to earth, take C = Vect and G = Z/2.

I learned a little bit about a few things I've never looked at before, and feel somewhat more inclined to learn about related things in the future. In particular, I really enjoyed the example of the \"correction term\" for the number of solutions of the polynomial equation over finite fields. It gives a sense of something deep and mysterious going on, which seems in the spirit.</p>\n<p>I was able to (roughly) follow the paper until the talk of the \"pieces\" of a torus on page 7.

I'm happy to say that a polynomial equation defines an elliptic curve if its complex solutions form a torus with one point removed. But I don't know what an elliptic curve is from this. Is it a set of solution points over a specified finite field? Possibly instead the set of complex solutions? These phrases seem to refer to some definition along these lines: \"To get the full elliptic curve we should include that extra point, even when working with a finite field\" and \"four pieces of the complex version of the elliptic curve, which is a torus\".</li>\n<li>The talk of pieces of elliptic curves is then difficult for me from the start, because I'm not exactly sure what's being discussed. Are we discussing subsets of a solution set for a polynomial equation over a specified finite field? Or possibly subsets of the solution set of a polynomial equation over the complex numbers?</li>\n<li>As an example of a particular point of confusion: \"The pieces of dimension k correspond to terms in the above formula that grow like <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>q</mi><mrow><mi>k</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">/</mi><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">q^{k/2}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1.0824em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.03588em;\">q</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.888em;\"><span style=\"top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal mtight\" style=\"margin-right:0.03148em;\">k</span><span class=\"mord mtight\">/2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>.\" I wasn't sure what \"growing like\" meant here - what variable are we talking about changing that makes things increase?

I know nothing about motives and never progressed past the point of briefly absorbing the definition of a scheme before promptly forgetting it, but I know a fair amount of practical linear algebra. In that vein, one tool that I've found profoundly capable in many applied settings is magnitude--or actually, weightings (whose sum is magnitude). Here too for a finite metric space one has a notion of \"effective number of points\" and in practical computations that number can and often is negative: basically, the effective size of a point (its weighting component) is big and positive for an \"outlier\", slightly smaller and negative \"just behind\" an outlier, and roughly unity everywhere else (in fact there are oscillatory corrections IIRC). I am not an analyst but I am given to understand via work of Mark Meckes that a weighting is secretly a Bessel potential, which forms a lovely and surprising connection between potential theory/PDE and all that and enriched category theory. Anyway as you know magnitude has a categorification that works in very general settings. Your description of motives makes me wonder if perhaps there is some actual or \"potential\" connection between magnitude and motives.</p>",

It began as a tenfold classification of states of matter based on their behavior under time reversal and charge conjugation.  Mathematically, it relies on the fact that there are ten super division algebra and ten kinds of Clifford algebras, where two Clifford algebras are of the same kind if they have equivalent categories of representations.  But Cartan also showed that there are ten infinite families of compact symmetric spaces!  After explaining symmetric spaces, we describe two ways to get compact symmetric spaces from Clifford algebras, which give <em>different</em> correspondences between these two manifestations of the<br>\ntenfold way.</p>\n<p>So, I have to get back to thinking about the tenfold way.</p>\n<p>3)  Jessica Flack has invited me to give a public lecture for the Santa Fe Institute. So, I'll go to Santa Fe from Friday May 19 to Wednesday May 24, and by then I need to prepare this talk:</p>\n<p><strong>Visions for the Future of Physics</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> The 20th century was, arguably, the century of physics. While there was immense progress on so-called “fundamental physics” — the basic laws governing matter, space, and time — fundamental physics has slowed to a crawl since 1980, despite an immense amount of work. But as John Baez will explain in this SFI Community Lecture, there is exciting progress in other branches of physics: for example, using the fundamental physics we already know to design surprising new forms of matter. Like all other sciences in the 21st century, physics must also embrace the challenges of the Anthropocene: the era in which humanity is a dominant influence on the Earth’s climate and biosphere. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>4) By June 1st I need to submit a proposal for a 6-week work session in Edinburgh on using category theory to design software for agent-based models in epidemiology.  I'm doing this with Nathaniel Osgood, who knows more about agent-based models, so I'm hoping he'll do most of the work on the proposal... but I think I need to get it started.</p>\n<p>5) However, I have enough time now to finish checking all the corrections David Roberts made to my paper <a href=\"http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/2group.pdf\">From loop groups to 2-groups</a>, and submit a new version to the arXiv, and an erratum to <em>Homology, Homotopy and Applications</em>.  So I'll start doing this today.</p>",

        "content": "<p>For a finite group G, we defined G-torsors over a number field k in our March 9, 2023 conversation.   Most abstractly these are 2-rig maps F: Rep(G) → Vect, where representations and Vect are defined using finite-dimensional vector spaces over k.   We also gave some other ways of thinking about these.  Today we study the case G = ℤ/3.   In this case F maps the group algebra k[G] to some cubic extension K of k - and this is the whole point, since we are using them to study cubic extensions of k.  The idea is that a cubic extension of k can be seen as a 'twisted version' of the group algebra k[ℤ/3].</p>\n<p>The theory works most simply when k contains (or is) the Eisenstein field: the rationals with a primitive cube root of 1 adjoined.  Then ℤ/3 splits over k, so one can show that a ℤ/3-torsor over K amounts to a line object L in the category of k-vector spaces together with a trivialization of its tensor cube:</p>\n<p><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>F</mi><mspace></mspace><mspace width=\"0.1111em\"/><mo lspace=\"0em\" rspace=\"0.17em\"></mo><mtext> ⁣</mtext><mo lspace=\"0em\" rspace=\"0em\">:</mo><mspace width=\"0.3333em\"/><msub><mn>1</mn><mo lspace=\"0em\" rspace=\"0em\">⊗</mo></msub><mo>→</mo><msup><mi>L</mi><mrow><mo>⊗</mo><mn>3</mn></mrow></msup></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\"> F \\colon 1_{\\otimes} \\to L^{\\otimes 3} </annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8917em;vertical-align:-0.2083em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.13889em;\">F</span><span class=\"mspace nobreak\"></span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.1111em;\"></span><span class=\"mpunct\"></span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:-0.1667em;\"></span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.1667em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mrel\">:</span></span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.3333em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord\">1</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t vlist-t2\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.2583em;\"><span style=\"top:-2.55em;margin-left:0em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\">⊗</span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"vlist-s\">​</span></span><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.2083em;\"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">→</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8141em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">L</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.8141em;\"><span style=\"top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\">⊗</span><span class=\"mord mtight\">3</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>\n<p>Even more concretely, we get a ℤ/3-torsor over k from a cube root of nonzero element A ∈ k.

It began as a tenfold classification of states of matter based on their behavior under time reversal and charge conjugation. Mathematically, it relies on the fact that there are ten super division algebras and ten kinds of Clifford algebras, where two Clifford algebras are of the same kind if they have equivalent super-categories of super-representations. But Cartan also showed that there are ten infinite families of compact symmetric spaces! After explaining symmetric spaces, we show how they arise naturally from forgetful functors between categories of representations of Clifford algebras.</p>\n</blockquote>",

But as I will explain, there is exciting progress in other branches of physics: for example, using the fundamental physics we already know to design surprising new forms of matter.

In his early career, he worked 20 years at Los Alamos National Laboratory, USA (1988-2007, Alien of Extraordinary Abilities) contributing to a variety of interdisciplinary research programs and projects. He was part of the core group establishing the Artificial Life field in the late 80s and in the 90s he co-developed the Transportation Simulation System (TRANSIMS) implemented by the US Department of Transportation, integrated simulation frameworks for urban security systems. He also developed web-based disaster mitigation tools, which were deployed in Cerro Grande Wildfire, May 2000, where 20,000 people were evacuated, and he was part of the original Los Alamos team on Critical Infrastructure Protection, implemented by the US Department of Homeland Security after September 11, 2001.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In 2004 he co-founded the European Center for Living Technology (ECLT) Venice, Italy, and late 2007 he returned to Denmark as Director of the Center for Fundamental Living Technology (FLinT) at SDU. In 2009 he founded the Initiative for Science Society and Policy (ISSP), which together with SFI and the ECLT allows Rasmussen to explore how living and intelligent technologies change society and what it means to be human. He has consulted on science and technology issues for the European Commission, Danish Parliament, German Bundestag, US Congress, as well as businesses and NGOs. He was part of the Danish Government’s Data Ethics Expert Group in 2018.</p>\n</blockquote>",

        "content": "<p>For a finite group G, we defined G-torsors over a number field k in our March 9, 2023 conversation.   Most abstractly these are 2-rig maps F: Rep(G) → Vect, where representations and Vect are defined using finite-dimensional vector spaces over k.   We also gave some other ways of thinking about these.  Today we study the case G = ℤ/3.   In this case F maps the group algebra k[G] to some cubic extension K of k - and this is the whole point, since we are using them to study cubic extensions of k.  The idea is that a cubic extension of k can be seen as a 'twisted version' of the group algebra k[ℤ/3].</p>\n<p>The theory works most simply when k contains (or is) the Eisenstein field: the rationals with a primitive cube root of 1 adjoined.  Then ℤ/3 splits over k, so one can show that a ℤ/3-torsor over K amounts to a line object L in the category of k-vector spaces together with a trivialization of its tensor cube.  Even more concretely, we get a ℤ/3-torsor over k from a cube root of nonzero element A ∈ k.   Then two choices of A, say A and A', give isomorphic Z/3-torsors iff A' = B³A for some nonzero B ∈ k. </p>\n<p>When k is the Eisenstein field, any cubic extension K is a 6th-degree extension of Q, and in fact (we claim) a Galois extension.  The Galois group of K over Q can thus be either ℤ/6, which is abelian, or S₃, which is not.   We thus consider this challenge: given A ≠ 0 in the Eisenstein field k, determine whether the Galois group of K over ℚ is abelian or not.</p>\n<p>Next, what if k does not contain the Eisenstein field?  Then we can redo our previous discussion using a formal 'Eisenstein object' E replacing the tensor unit in Vect, and an 'Eisenstein line object' replacing L.</p>",

If we tensor this abelian group GL(1,ℚ(ω)) with the field with 3 elements (thought of as another abelian group), we get an infinite-dimensional vector space over the field with 3 elements.  This has one basis element for each Eisenstein prime mod units, together with one for the units.   How does Eisenstein conjugation act on this vector space?  Since this operator squares to 1, we can split this vector space as a direct sum of the +1 eigenspace and the -1 eigenspace.</p>\n<p>The work of Albert, Brauer, Hasse and Noether relating the Brauer group of a number field k to the second cohomology of its Galois group:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert-Brauer-Hasse-Noether_theorem\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert-Brauer-Hasse-Noether_theorem</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brauer_group\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brauer_group</a></p>\n<p>Peter Roquette, The Brauer-Hasse-Noether theorem in historical perspective, <a href=\"https://www.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/~roquette/brhano.pdf\">https://www.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/~roquette/brhano.pdf</a></p>\n<p>This relies on building central simple algebras over k as 'twisted' versions of the group algebra of the absolute Galois group of k.

Agent-based modeling is like 'microscopic' modeling of a system whereas games usually deal with 'mesoscopic' models. The overlap is in mean-field games where game-theoretic agents are assumed to be many and identical. Open games so far didn't venture into that territory though.</p>\n<p>Thermodynamic limit of open games is something quite interesting to ponder, however...</p>",

The first time he wrote to me was to give me the subject of the thesis and the work plan; the second is to tell me to drop the problem of inverting objects if I can't do it. As for me, I think I wrote to him three times: the first was to tell Grothendieck that I couldn't invert objects because of the non-strict commutativity; the second is to tell him that I succeeded in inverting objects; and the third is to tell him that I have finished the job. The letters had to be very short because we were in time of war, eight months for a letter to arrive at its destination between France and Vietnam. When I finished my work in writing, I sent it to my brother, who lives in France, and he brought it to Grothendieck.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The difficulties I had encountered were firstly the absence of the library and of colleagues with whom I could exchange ideas and there were also other difficulties of the post-war years.</p>\n<p>Thank you very much, Dear Mrs. John Baez, and please convey to Professor John Baez my warmest greetings and great gratitude.</p>\n</blockquote>",

La première de ses occasions a été la soutenance de la thèse de Mme Sinh en 1975, qu’elle avait préparée au Vietnam dans des conditions exceptionellement difficiles. Il a été le premier que j’aie contacté pour faire partie du jury de thèse. Il s’est récusé, laissant entendre qu’il ne pouvait s’agir là que d’une thèse bidon, à laquelle il n’était pas question qu’il apporte sa caution. (J’ai eu l’adresse pourtant d’arriver à circonvenir la bonne foi de Cartan, Schwartz, Deny et Zisman pour me prêter main forte pour cette supercherie — et la soutenance a eu lieu dans une ambiance d’intérêt et de sympathie chaleureuse.) Il a fallu trois ou quatre expériences du même genre, dans les trois années suivantes, avant que je finisse par comprendre qu’il y avait en mon prestigieux et influent ami un propos délibéré d’antagonisme vis-à-vis de mes élèves “d’après 1970”, come aussi à l’égard des travaux qui portent seulement la marque de mon influence (tout au moins ceux entrepris “après 1970”).\"</p>\n<p>I do not like controversies, but here you can find the relation of Cartan with the thesis (following Grothendieck).</p>",

Moreover, it is clear to me (I wrote several such Notes while I was working on my French Doctorat d'Etat) that  this is the (edited draft) of a Note aux Comptes Rendus de l'Académie des Sciences de Paris (CRAS), written by Ms Sinh and presented (read) by Monsieur Henri Cartan.   The presenter must be a member of the Academy and he is not supposed to edit the Note, just to \"read\" it in front of his peers.   It is the thesis advisor in this case who checks the note for mathematical soundness, style and syntax ( by the way, there are still some typos in this draft; it seems to me that the  handwriting is Ms. Sinh's, not Grothendieck's).  What Ms Sinh does here  is very usual: to announce results that will be presented later in full (de manière détaillée) in her thesis...</p>",

        "content": "<p>I enjoyed reading part of the draft! From my beginner perspective, I especially appreciated the detailed intuitive explanation of the reasoning behind the definition of a monoidal category. For example, it was great to read an explanation of <em>why</em> we want the pentagon diagram to commute: so that we can use different sequences of unitors and associators to re-parenthesize an expression, and as long as we arrive at the same final result (in terms of the location of parentheses), we don't need to care about about which specific sequence of unitors and associators we used.</p>\n<p>I also especially enjoyed the example you gave of the symmetries of a sphere and the \"paths\" between these. I found it fun to visualize this example by associating a 3D rotation matrix to the point on the sphere that the north pole (of a sphere centred at the origin) is sent to under that rotation. Then a continuous path between two 3D rotation matrices hopefully corresponds to a continuous path on the sphere between the corresponding two points. To be able to compose a path and the \"reverse\" of that path and get the identity, I assume we actually need to consider homotopy equivalence classes of paths.</p>\n<p>Building on this example, I was trying to think of how to get more examples of Gr-categories, because I find examples helpful for understanding new abstract concepts. If we have some manifold where each point of the manifold is an element of a group, can we get a Gr-category by...</p>\n<ul>\n<li>taking the points of this manifold to be our objects,</li>\n<li>and taking the homotopy equivalence classes of paths between points in the manifold to be our morphisms?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Returning to the draft, I got up to page 7 before I ran out of steam.

The number 8 is special because of Bott periodicity, the octonions and the E8 lattice, while 24 is special for many reasons, including the binary tetrahedral group, the 3rd stable homotopy group of spheres, and the Leech lattice.   The number 8 does for superstring theory what the number 24 does for bosonic string theory.

        "content": "<p>As someone who plays the piano, I really enjoyed your blog post!<br>\nIf I understand correctly, at least part of what you are saying is:<br>\nThere are 84 modes in total, which include other scales besides major and natural minor! But we can understand where all these modes come from. In particular, two pieces of data pick out a single mode:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The tonic of our scale (its first note). There are twelve options here (C, C#, D, D#, ..., B).</li>\n<li>Where in a sequence of 7 rising perfect fifths our tonic should be placed. There are seven options here.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If I'm understanding this correctly, it's very cool that all these modes can be cleanly organized! It's a lot simpler than the scary Latin names led me to believe.</p>\n<p>For example, we can understand the \"C major scale\" as being described by these two pieces of data:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>the tonic is a C</li>\n<li>the C should occur second in our sequence of seven rising perfect fifths</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To get the C major scale from this data, we then take all the notes in our perfect fifths sequence and put them in order, with C at the start.</p>\n<p>This makes me wonder: What would happen if we used a different interval instead of perfect fiths to generate our scales? For example, what would we get if we specified a \"scale\" by (1) a starting note (tonic) and (2) the position of the tonic in a sequence of 7 rising major thirds? </p>\n<p>In this case, because 4 is not relatively prime to 12, I think our scale will be shorter! We would expect to get \"full length\" scales when generating rising interval sequences where we step up each time by 5, 7, or 11 half steps as 5,7, and 11 are relatively prime to 12. Of course, going up 7 half steps is the same as going up a perfect fifth (the case analyzed in the blog post), but maybe you can get some fun other scales using 5 or 11!</p>\n<p>For example, let's say the tonic is a C, and the C should occur second in our sequence of seven rising perfect fourths: we get G, C, F, B flat, E flat, A flat, D flat. Putting these in order, we get: C, D flat, E flat, F, G, A flat, B flat which has a fun sound to it! I think this is just an A flat major scale where we start at C, so it's not something really new, though. (Although arguably it has a different \"feel\" than A flat major because you emphasize the C when playing this scale, it's the \"home base\" of this scale). I suspect this happens in general, because going down 7 half steps is the same as going up 5 half steps, in the sense that you end up on a note with the same name. Indeed, reversing the sequence we obtained above, we get: D flat, A flat, E flat, B flat, F, C, G. So, we get all the same unique notes from going up 7 half steps or going up 5 half steps - we just might have to start at different places. Overall, I suspect going up 5 half steps at a time doesn't generate anything new relative to going up 7 half steps at a time.</p>\n<p>Going up 11 half steps will just give a portion of the chromatic scale, although potentially with a big \"jump\" between notes. For example, if C is our second note in our 7-note sequence where we go up by 11 half steps each time, we get: C#, C, B, B flat, A, A flat, G. Putting this in order with C at the start, we get: C, C#, G, A flat, A, B flat, B. Again, playing this in order is fun! Played dramatically, it can have a very sharp and anxious sound to it. Upon reflection, I bet one would get essentially the same thing by going up 1 half step each time, because going up 11 half steps is very similar to going down 1 half step.</p>",

For example, what would we get if we specified a \"scale\" by (1) a starting note (tonic) and (2) the position of the tonic in a sequence of 7 rising major thirds? </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's an interesting idea!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In this case, because 4 is not relatively prime to 12, I think our scale will be shorter! </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, you'll get a scale with just 3 different notes, like C E Ab.     And it will be a very symmetrical scale, so the tonic doesn't stand out as sounding different from any other note, as it does in the more commonly used modes I was discussing.   The composer Messiaen liked highly symmetrical scales like this: he called them <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCXxV7eDEPc\">modes of limited transposition</a>:</p>\n<div class=\"youtube-video message_inline_image\"><a data-id=\"nCXxV7eDEPc\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCXxV7eDEPc\"><img src=\"https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/310c02a5d676ff46e87591ee0f3856426edd096c/68747470733a2f2f692e7974696d672e636f6d2f76692f6e435878563765444550632f64656661756c742e6a7067\"></a></div>",

I suppose that's because they always contain all the same notes, just in a different order. (And this isn't the case with the modes generated by perfect fifths, because it takes more than seven rising perfect fifths to loop back around to our tonic).</p>\n<p>All this makes me wonder how different music would be if we could go up 13 \"small steps\" to make an octave, instead of 12 half steps. Then, each of 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11, and 12 are relatively prime to 13 and so I think would generate \"full length\" modes. I'm guessing by analogy to what happened above that 1 and 12 would generate the same modes, as would 2 and 11, 3 and 10, 4 and 9, 8 and 5, and 7 and 6. But that's still potentially six different kinds of scales, compared to the two that we get when we have to go up by 12 half steps to complete an octave (as discussed above)! My dad pointed out one could probably write a program to listen to these kinds of scales (or even write music with them). But I also wonder if there are any physical instruments that subdivide the octave into 13 small steps!</p>",

This is the trade-off that allows for modulation to a different key without changing the relative tones of each note.

If k is a number field, we can characterize the ℤ/3-torsors over k in two equivalent ways: the 'Tannakian' way and the 'Frobenius pattern' way.</p>\n<p>As already discussed in our April 20, 2023 talk, the 'theory of ℤ/3 torsors over ℚ' is another way of talking about the category of representations of ℤ/3 on rational vector spaces.  'Theories' here are symmetric monoidal locally presentable categories, and we can also describe this theory by saying it's the free symmetric monoidal locally presentable category on an Eisenstein line object L with a trivialization of its tensor cube.  We can further constrain this theory by saying that the Eisenstein conjugate of L is isomorphic to its tensor square (in a way compatible with the above trivialization).  This extra constraint makes it so models of this theory in the category of vector spaces over k correspond to <em>abelian</em> cubic extensions of the number field k.   </p>\n<p>We can also state this all more concretely, 'gauge-fixing' by taking L to be the 'standard' Eistenstein line object E, which can be taken to be the sum of two copies of the unit for the tensor product in our theory.  We can actually put this into the theory, equipping our theory an isomorphism G: L → E.  Then the models of the theory are given by solutions to some polynomial equations, which we outline.</p>",

        "content": "<p>An attempt to understand some of James Dolan's recent thoughts on torsors.  Fix a field k and a finite group G.  Let Vect be the category of vector spaces over k.  Let Rep(G) be the category of representations of G on vector spaces over k.  Rep(G) is a '2-rig', or more precisely a locally presentable 2-rig: that is, a symmetric monoidal locally presentable Vect-enriched category.</p>\n<p>Rep(G) is generated, as a 2-rig, by the regular representation of G, which we could call r(G).  But Rep(G) also contains another special object kᴳ: the algebra of functions on the finite set G, treated as a trivial representation of G.  This is a coalgebra in Rep(G) whose comultiplication encodes the multiplication in G.  This coalgebra kᴳ has a coaction on r(G), r(g) →  r(g) ⊗ kᴳ.  This coaction makes r(G) into what James calls a 'G-torsor in Rep(G)', meaning that there is also a 'codivision' map kᴳ → x ⊗ x obeying a certain equation.   All this is dual to how a nonempty set X is a torsor of G if it has an action G × X → X together with a division map X × X → G obeying a certain equation.</p>\n<p>Indeed, any 2-rig R contains a Hopf object that we could call kᴳ: it's the direct sum of G copies of the unit object, with a comultiplication coming from multiplication in G.  We can use this to define a concept of a 'G-torsor in R', copying the definition just given in Rep(G).</p>\n<p>Such a G-torsor in a 2-rig R works out to be the secretly the same thing as a 2-rig map F: Rep(G) → R, since we can determine such an F by choosing any G-torsor in R, and vice versa.  Thus, James usually shortcuts the whole process and defines a G-torsor in a 2-rig R simply to be a 2-rig map F: Rep(G) → R.</p>\n<p>Finally, suppose L is any field extending k with Galois group G.  Then L gives an algebra object in Vect which is also a G-torsor in Vect.</p>",

Her life is the consistent journey of a patriotic intellectual and talented scientist: from the decision to leave a comfortable life in France to return to contribute to Vietnamese education during the war years, determined to reach the pinnacle of science in extremely difficult conditions, to extraordinary efforts and determination to overcome countless challenges, building the first non-public university in Vietnam's education system.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the first part of this book, the reader can see part of the handwritten manuscript of the thesis, which Professor Hoang Xuan Sinh sent to Paris. At that time, it was almost impossible to type the Thesis! This manuscript is a valuable document that Thang Long University has thanks to the enthusiastic and generous help of Professor Nguyen Tien Dung (Toulouse University) and Dr. Jean Malgoire, Grothendieck's last graduate student.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Hoàng Xuân Sính took notes on his lectures and later did her thesis work with him by correspondence. In her thesis she developed the theory of \"Gr-categories\", which are monoidal categories in which all objects and morphisms have inverses.

Organisms possess a variety of sensory systems, ranging from gene regulatory networks to neural circuits, that integrate environmental and social cues in order to inform development, behavior, and interactions. In turn, much of the information needed to build and implement sensory integration systems is encoded in the genome. Natural selection acts on phenotypes shaped by the information that organisms acquire, and accumulates adaptive genetic information in the process. As a result, the capabilities of biological information processing systems evolve over time, coming full circle. Information theoretic approaches have significantly advanced our understanding of each of these domains, and the time is ripe to develop “unified theories” for how biological information changes in concert with evolutionary and ecological feedbacks. The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers studying mechanisms for information encoding and processing at the individual level with those studying the processes of information accumulation and propagation at the collective level. In doing so, the workshop aims to catalyze information theoretic connections that bridge domains and advance our understanding of ecology and evolution.</p>\n</blockquote>",

For example: our collision with the planet Theia, the \"snowball Earth events\" when most of the oceans froze over, and the asteroid impact that ended the age of dinosaurs.

I found it was a good way to start conversations with people all around the world.  But back then there were far fewer blogs - and nothing like Facebook or Twitter or Tiktok - so it was easier to attract attention than it is now.</p>\n<p>Later, as it became harder to get anyone to notice anything, I still enjoyed blogging because I realized it was a good way to clarify my thoughts.   If I can't explain something clearly, it's usually because I don't understand it well enough yet.   Blogging also makes it easier to remember things: when I forget something I can often look at old articles I wrote to refresh my memory.  By now it's a basic part of how I work.</p>",

the square is a geometric sequence. By the way, the reason Boethius is talking about this is because he is interested in studying \"even-ness\" and \"odd-ness\". Here, he is interested in numbers that are \"somewhat even\" but not \"minimally\" or \"maximally\" even. These are the numbers that have at least two factors of 2, and have at least one prime factor besides 2. The first column is the \"least even\" numbers satisfying these criteria - the odd multiples of 4 (skipping <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mn>4</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">4 \\times 1</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.7278em;vertical-align:-0.0833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">4</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222em;\"></span><span class=\"mbin\">×</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">1</span></span></span></span>).

By the way, the reason Boethius is talking about this is because he is interested in studying \"even-ness\" and \"odd-ness\". Here, he is interested in numbers that are \"somewhat even\" but not \"minimally\" or \"maximally\" even. These are the numbers that have at least two factors of 2, and have at least one prime factor besides 2.

So, they were excluded from the discussion in this section, where \"somewhat even\" numbers were under consideration.</p>\n<p>Based on my (rough) understanding of what Boethius was saying up to this point in the book, I  believe he did consider <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">1</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">1</span></span></span></span> to be a number, but he did not mention <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">0</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">0</span></span></span></span>. Quoting from that article I linked to, the translation (or paraphrase?) in English says at one point \"Number is defined as a collection of units, or as a flow of quantity made up of units\".  And I believe he talks about adding one and multiplying by one in various places.</p>\n<p>However, interestingly, I don't think he considered zero to be a number. Again quoting from the article I mentioned above: \"Every number is equal to one-half the sum of the numbers next above and next below it, the next one but one above and below, the next one but two, and so on. Thus, 5 = 1/2 (4 + 6); 5 = 1/2(3 + 7); and 5 =1/2 (2 + 8). This is true of every number but unity, which has nothing below it and so is equal to one-half the number above it.\" </p>\n<p>If Boethius had wanted to introduce a new number \"below unity\" while extending the pattern he points out, then he would want some number <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">x</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.4306em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">x</span></span></span></span> so that <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn><mo>=</mo><mo stretchy=\"false\">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn><mo stretchy=\"false\">)</mo><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">/</mi><mn>2</mn></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">1=(x+2)/2</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">1</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">=</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mopen\">(</span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">x</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222em;\"></span><span class=\"mbin\">+</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2222em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">2</span><span class=\"mclose\">)</span><span class=\"mord\">/2</span></span></span></span>.

It remained a number for the purpose of doing arithmetic. Around 100 AD, for example, Nicomachus of Gerasa (in his Introduction to Arithmetic, Book 1, VIII, 9–12) discusses the powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512 = α, β, δ, η, ιϛ, λβ, ξδ, ρκη, σνϛ, φιβ) and notes that “it is the property of all these terms when they are added together successively to be equal to the next in the series, lacking a monas (συμβέβηκε δὲ πᾱ́σαις ταῖς ἐκθέσεσι συντεθειμέναις σωρηδὸν ἴσαις εἶναι τῷ μετ’ αὐτὰς παρὰ μονάδα).” In the same work (Book 1, XIX, 9), he provides a multiplication table for the numbers 1 through 10.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I disagree about this for \"being in love\", and also for many other things like \"being a good musician\", \"being a good mathematician\", etc.   I believe that for many such activities it is up to the individual to invent/discover their own personal version of what the activity actually is.   Furthermore, the activity is not separate from the process of inventing or discovering one's own personal concept  of the activity.   That is, there's no way to first figure out what it means to do the activity and then do it.     You can't really know what it means to do it except by trying to do it - even before you really know what it means!   You could try to do it by following some rules that somebody listed for you, but this would be missing the point.   Some advice here and there can be helpful sometimes, but part of the advice should be \"don't always follow someone's else's advice: they're not you, and they can't know what you need to do.\"</p>",

I think it became famous because of Jacques Tits \"boutade\" (joke-hoax) :  the symmetric group is just  GLn (general linear group in dimension n ). over the field of one element\".    An elementary motivation is to calculate the number of k - dimensional subspaces of an n-dimensional vector space over the finite field with q elements.  You find some nice polynomials  in q as a result.  When I ask my  undergrads \"what would you like to do with these polynomial when nobody is looking?\", usually a (female) student answers: \"evaluating them at q = 1\"  (although q was supposed to be a power of a prime number).   Then, lo!, they find the combinatorial numbers which give you the number of subsets of cardinal k in a set with n elements.   Conclusion: a vector space over the field with one element is a set with n elements.    Exercise: Give a categorical rendering of this ... You can google Pierre Cartier, or Cristoph Soulé on this non-existent field...</p>",

Of course when you think about it, it's hard to imagine they had a clear sense of an abstract number in the 4th or 5th century BC, before Plato even showed up, so I find it an easy argument to buy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I wonder if Lawvere had read this book. I went to one talk by him, at CT in Cambridge, and he was mentioning how an \"arithmos\", something composed out of units, is really a structural set (or something like that). Here's him in 2015 (<a href=\"https://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~wlawvere/GrothendiekAveiro15.htm\">https://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~wlawvere/GrothendiekAveiro15.htm</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The idea of an opposition between a category of cohesive spaces and a category of anti-cohesive sets also applies in particular to Cantor's description of the relation between a category of Mengen and a sub-category of Kardinalen. In fact, it appears that in general the discrete is a co-reflective subcategory of the cohesive, with the co-reflection extracting, as an Aristotelian arithmos, the Cantor 'cardinal of X' or the Hausdorff 'points of X'.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Lawvere then mentions \"lauter Einsen\" (\"bunch of units\" which dates back to his 1994 paper with this phrase in the title, but which doesn't mention arithmoi). Lawvere and Rosebrugh mention \"arithmos\" in <em>Sets for Mathematics</em>, which was published 2003, shortly after Mayberry's book from 2000.</p>",

The lower-pitched notes, which have lower frequencies, should then sound with shorter durations, but that's not what I'm hearing. It sounds like it's the other way around, like maybe the duration is directly proportional to the period of the sound wave, which is inversely proportional to the frequency. Am I wrong?</p>",

I'm glad it paid off, and I hope you do well!</p>\n<p>I was one of the first people to blog (before the world-wide web existed).    I did it in part because the woman who is now my wife lived on the other side of the country for 7 years before we got jobs in the same place, so I was lonely and bored at night.  I found it was a good way to start conversations with people all around the world.  But back then there were far fewer blogs - and nothing like Facebook or Twitter or Tiktok - so it was easier to attract attention than it is now.</p>\n<p>Later, as it became harder to get anyone to notice anything, I still enjoyed blogging because I realized it was a good way to clarify my thoughts.   If I can't explain something clearly, it's usually because I don't understand it well enough yet.   Blogging also makes it easier to remember things: when I forget something I can often look at old articles I wrote to refresh my memory.  By now it's a basic part of how I work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hey <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"275920\">@John Baez</span> , it has been some time since you wrote this beautiful message! I've been ruminating on it over the weeks as I thought this was both such a nice story as well as it being inspirational (seems as though several others did too!). Since we last messaged a bit, I thought about how to develop further the habit of writing and have made a small little academic writing support group with some friends and collaborators. I definitely feel that blogging and writing in general improve my thinkings about things -- hoping to make this a habit that sticks like you have done!</p>",

Rothen and Beverly Langston identified the work as one that \"subtly speaks to a child\", with \"engaging characters and fast-paced action [that] make it readable.\" This echoed Nicholas Tucker's praise for the story's suspense in the <em>New Statesman</em>: \"Adams ... has bravely and successfully resurrected the big picaresque adventure story, with moments of such tension that the helplessly involved reader finds himself checking whether things are going to work out all right on the next page before daring to finish the preceding one.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Adams won the 1972 Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book by a British subject. He also won the annual Guardian Children's Fiction Prize, a similar award that authors may not win twice.  In 1977 California schoolchildren selected it for the inaugural California Young Reader Medal in the Young Adult category, which annually honours one book from the last four years.  In <em>The Big Read</em>, a 2003 survey of the British public, it was voted the forty-second greatest book of all time.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Indeed, I did not know such interesting aspects of the history of numerals, ad I wish to thank you all for sharing such tasteful stuff. However, the world \"number\" does not seem to have a greek etymology, but rather a latin one. It is based on the latin word \"numerus\", whose root is the proto-indo-european word \"nem-\" which means \"assign, allot; take\". Therefore, a \"number\" is a quantity of stuff that results from a partition... from this perspective, not only \"one\", but also \"zero\" is legitimately a number.</p>",

I'm now helping lead a new Fields Institute program on the mathematics of climate change.</p>\n<p>You may have heard of the Fields Medal, one of the most prestigious math prizes.  But the <a href=\"http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/about\">Fields Institute</a>, in Toronto, holds a lot of meetings on mathematics.  So when COVID hit, it was a big problem.  The director of the institute, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V._Kumar_Murty\">Kumar Murty</a>, decided to steer into the wind and set up a network of institutions working on COVID, including projects on the mathematics of <a href=\"http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/20-21/outbreaks\">infectious disease</a> and <a href=\"http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/20-21/systemic\">systemic risks</a>.  This worked well, so now he wants to start a project on the mathematics of climate change.  <a href=\"https://www.cs.usask.ca/people/faculty%20profiles/nathaniel-osgood.php\">Nathaniel Osgood</a> and I are leading it.</p>\n<p>Nate, as I call him, is a good friend and collaborator.  He's a computer scientist at the University of Saskatchewan and, among other things, an expert on epidemiology who helped lead COVID modeling for Canada.  We're currently using category theory to <a href=\"https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2023/08/17/agent-based-models-part-2/\">develop a better framework for agent-based models</a>.</p>\n<p>Nate and I plan to focus the Fields Institute project not on the geophysics of climate change - e.g., trying to predict how bad global warming will be - but the human response to it - that is, figuring out what we should do!   This project will be part of the Fields Institute's <a href=\"http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/centres/centre-sustainable-development\">Centre for Sustainable Development</a>.</p>\n<p>I'll have a lot more to say about this.  But for now, let me just say: I'm very excited to have this opportunity!  Mathematics may not be the <em>main</em> thing we need to battle climate change, but there are important things in this realm that can only be done with the help of math.  I know a lot of mathematicians, computer scientists, statisticians and others with quantitative skills want to do something about climate change.  I aim to help them do it.   And since I have a special fondness for applied category theory, I'll be describing some ways some ways you folks here can join in.</p>",

You've inspired me to think more about this stuff going back to the early days of Azimuth Project.</p>\n<p>Just a word of caution though. I expressed this to you about the COVID modeling and the same applies to climate science modeling.</p>\n<p>One thing I've learned working in corporate life is that models can be used for good and they can be used for evil. Give me a thesis, and I can build you a believable model that supports the thesis. I can also build a believable model that supports the opposite thesis. Even with the same data! Building models is a super power with real implications.</p>\n<p>Both COVID and climate science are highly political issues and it is brave to try to help, but at the same time, these models should be taken very seriously. As seriously, maybe, as the Manhattan project. People can use these models to start wars. People can and probably will die as a result of using these models.</p>\n<p>For example, the COVID models only looked at infection rates and not the mental health aspects. Now we have a largely broken COVID generation (my kids being a part of that).</p>\n<p>I don't have a good answer for what to do about this, but think it is a serious topic worth talking about. The one thing I can say is to please not be naive and think people are going to use these models only for good. People are going to find ways to twist these models to support their own agendas. How can you protect against that?</p>",

Mathematicians like me aren't the ones making the models or making public policy decisions based on the models.   But one thing mathematicians can do - which our team is already doing! - is making models that are easier to understand.   </p>\n<p>Nate Osgood does a lot of public health modeling.  He complains that often the models are just piles of code which nobody - except, one hopes, the model's creator - understands very well.   There is not a clear specification of the model outside the code itself, so if you ask what's the model, and you want to know <em>exactly</em> what it is, you ultimately are forced to read a lot of code.    Sometimes the model's creator is a postdoc and when they get a new job, nobody in the original research group really understands the model.    Then they try to change the model, to improve it in some way.  You can see the potential for problems.</p>\n<p>So, Nate has been trying to fix this problem, and that's what our team's work using category theory aims to do.    We're trying to make the models more transparent.</p>\n<p>I think this is a good thing.  It's easier to abuse a model when almost nobody understands it.</p>",

S. Bach  <br>\nSuman Kulkarni, Sophia U. David, Christopher W. Lynn, Dani S. Bassett</p>\n<p>Music has a complex structure that expresses emotion and conveys information. Humans process that information through imperfect cognitive instruments that produce a gestalt, smeared version of reality. How can we quantify the information contained in a piece of music? Further, what is the information inferred by a human, and how does that relate to (and differ from) the true structure of a piece? To tackle these questions quantitatively, we present a framework to study the information conveyed in a musical piece by constructing and analyzing networks formed by notes (nodes) and their transitions (edges). Using this framework, we analyze music composed by J. S. Bach through the lens of network science and information theory. Regarded as one of the greatest composers in the Western music tradition, Bach's work is highly mathematically structured and spans a wide range of compositional forms, such as fugues and choral pieces. Conceptualizing each composition as a network of note transitions, we quantify the information contained in each piece and find that different kinds of compositions can be grouped together according to their information content and network structure. Moreover, we find that the music networks communicate large amounts of information while maintaining small deviations of the inferred network from the true network, suggesting that they are structured for efficient communication of information. We probe the network structures that enable this rapid and efficient communication of information--namely, high heterogeneity and strong clustering. Taken together, our findings shed new light on the information and network properties of Bach's compositions. More generally, our framework serves as a stepping stone for exploring musical complexities, creativity and the structure of information in a range of complex systems.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Moreover, explicit examination and experimentation to isolate the behavioral mechanisms responsible for the effectiveness of behavioral interventions are foundational in advancing the field of Science of Behavior Change. Unfortunately, this has been held back by the difficulty of precisely comparing behavioral mechanisms that are formulated in disparate contexts using different operational definitions. This is a problem we aim to solve.</p>\n<p>We propose to initiate a new era of epidemiological modeling, in which agent-based models (ABMs) can be flexibly created from standardized behavioral mechanism modules that can be easily combined, shared, adapted, and reused in diverse ways for different types of insight. To do this, we must transform the sprawling repertoire of ABM methodologies into a systematic science of modular ABMs. This requires developing new mathematics based on Applied Category Theory (ACT). The proposers have already used ACT to develop modular models that represent human behavior en masse. To capture human behavior at the individual level in a modular way demands significant further conceptual advances, which we propose to make here.</p>\n<p>We will develop the mathematics of modular ABMs and implement it by creating modules that capture the behavioral mechanisms put forward by the SOBC: self-regulation, interpersonal &amp; social processes, and stress-reactivity &amp; resilience. We will evaluate this approach in a test case—the vaping crisis—by using these modules to build proof-of-concept ABMs of this crisis and comparing these new modular ABMs to existing models. We will create open-access libraries of modules for specific behavioral mechanisms and larger ABMs built from these modules. We will also run education and training events to disseminate our work.</p>",

The SOBC has ushered in a new era in behavioral intervention design based on the study of behavioral mechanisms. Our work incorporating SOBC-studed behavioral mechanisms as standardized modules in ABMs will transform the field of epidemiological modeling and lead to more rapid progress in SOBC. The key contribution of our work to all three fields is that it provides the ability to easily compare models with different operational definitions of behavioral mechanisms—since rather than a model being a large monolithic structure, opaque to everyone but its creators, it can now be built from standardized behavioral mechanism modules, and the effect of changing a single module can easily be studied.</p>",

It did actually cross my mind, but in the deligne case you write every object as a \"sum of pure tensors\" (where \"sum\" = colimit). Since we don't have colimits in this context, I threw this idea out... Somehow it didn't cross my mind to write every object as a \"sum of pure tensors\" (where \"sum\" = monoidal product).</p>",

It turns out that matrices arise naturally from 'spans', where a span between two objects is just a third object with maps to both those two. In terms of spans, the canonical commutation relations have a simple combinatorial interpretation. More recently, Khovanov introduced a 'categorified' Heisenberg algebra, where the canonical commutation relations hold only up to isomorphism, and these isomorphisms obey new relations of their own. The meaning of these new relations was initially rather mysterious, at least to me. However, Jeffery Morton and Jamie Vicary have shown that these, too, have a nice interpretation in terms of spans.</p>\n</blockquote>",

It's a bit like getting a lot of practice making bricks and then suddenly being told to build a house.   Then, traditionally, they have to break their thesis into papers and publish those.  (What's that like - chopping up the first house you built and trying to turn it into apartments and sell those?)   It's not surprising that people finding writing math difficult.

You don't need to know this math to use ModelCollab.

Nate and Patty decided that instead of an infectious disease model - which is sort of old-fashioned textbook stuff, which will make the readers yawn - we should do something like smoking or diabetes.   To really incorporate lots of details about human behavior, which are important in these diseases, it's best to use agent-based models.  But our agent-based model software is still just being built, so we decided to stick with stock and flow modeling.  Nate and Patty thought there should be some pretty good stock and flow models of diabetes in the literature, so we'll try to base our examples on one of those.</p>",

But the place I feel most frustrated is getting a good understanding of the Todd class, which is the key to many of these mysteries.  Allen Knutson put his finger on it: the Todd class shows up in the relation between the additive formal group law and the multiplicative formal group law.   But there are pathetically basic things about this that I don't understand!   Once I do, the <a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch+theorem\">Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem</a> should make intuitive sense - see the commutative square there and how the Todd class enters.

There are many ways to categorify this concept, but here we explain one specific definition that sheds new light on topology and representation theory. Examples of such 2-rigs include categories of group representations, coherent sheaves and vector bundles. We explain some theorems and conjectures about 2-rigs with simple universal properties. For example, the free 2-rig on one generator is called the 2-rig of “Schur functors” because it acts as endofunctors of every 2-rig. It has as objects all finite direct sums of irreducible representations of symmetric groups. Furthermore, the “splitting principle” for vector bundles has a universal formulation in terms of this 2-rig. This is joint work with Joe Moeller and Todd Trimble.</p>\n<p>In this talk there are a number of conjectures and problems for people to work on!</p>",

        "content": "<p>Here's a bit of the idea:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Many of the most urgent social, economic and public health problems facing humanity require dynamic simulation modeling for a well-informed response. Sadly, most current models are monolithic one-offs: labour intensive to build, difficult to reuse or adapt, and reliant on proprietary software that researchers are not free to improve.  Our team has been developing a flexible open-source modeling framework based that promotes transparency, reproducibility and scientific rigor  by allowing model components to be shared and changed [ABM,B1,B2,SF].  This software is based on sophisticated mathematics from applied category theory, but it comes with a graphical web-based interface that requires no mathematical expertise to use.  </p>\n<p>In the current project we plan to develop software that combines two widely used simulation techniques: \"agent-based models'' and \"stock and flow models''.  We call this blend of techniques \"hybrid modeling\".</p>\n<p>An <strong>agent-based model</strong> or <strong>ABM</strong> describes the dynamics of one or more open populations of individual agents interacting with each other and with an environment in which they are embedded [MO].  A <strong>stock and flow model</strong> uses ordinary differential equations to describe the change of continuous quantities in time as they flow from one \"stock\" to another [Sterman].   By a <strong>hybrid model</strong>, we mean an ABM that combines discrete updating of agent state with continuous dynamics described by one or more stock and flow models.</p>\n<p>In our 2024 Mathematics for Humanity research-in-groups project we successfully developed a category-theoretic framework for ABMs based on team member Brown's work [Brown].  We then used this framework to create a powerful software system for developing ABMs [ABM].   The system is now being used for research in epidemiology, and as a teaching tool.  However, this system does not yet support hybrid modeling.</p>\n<p>In 2022, several of our team members joined other collaborators to create a software system for stock and flow models [B1,SF].  In subsequent years they created a web-based interface for this system [B2,ModelCollab], which is now being used for research and teaching---teaching not only at the university level, but in a program involving high school math clubs focused around minority youth in Toronto.  However, this software does not allow the creation of ABMs.</p>\n<p>In the proposed project, we plan to develop the mathematics and then the software required for a disciplined approach to hybrid models.  One key feature will be the ability to \"turn on\" continuous dynamics of various kinds in various specific states, and disable them in other states.  To give an example of great significance in gestational diabetes: when a woman becomes pregnant, but only then, fetal growth and her body weight evolve according to specific dynamics studied in recent research by Thomas and others [T].</p>\n<p>We then plan to implement models that demonstrate the capacity of our software in two spheres: public health (gestational diabetes) and economics (labour shocks as the economy decarbonizes).</p>\n</blockquote>",

This is true at all times: <em>before</em> he crosses the horizon, <em>when</em> he crosses it, and <em>after</em> he crosses it.</p>\n<p>Captain Bob never sees any starship cross the horizon until he crosses it. At the moment he crosses the horizon, he sees all 50 starships ahead of him also crossing it — but not the 50 behind him.</p>\n<p>However, when any of the starships behind him crosses the horizon, the captain of <em>that</em> starship will see Bob also crossing the horizon!</p>\n<p>Captain Bob never sees any starship hit the singularity — not even the 50 starships in front of him. The singularity is always in his future, until he hits it.</p>\n<p>Thus, as Captain Bob falls into the black hole, he sees his partner, Captain Alice, in front of him for the rest of his short life. But how much is she redshifted?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mathstodon.xyz/@gregeganSF/113564919547422793\">Greg Egan</a> made some assumptions and graphed the result. This shows the frequency of the light Bob sees divided by the frequency of light Alice emitted, as a function of time as ticked off by Bob’s watch<a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/fHefgraq286Dncap6CtTYgjI/black_hole_egan_alice_and_bob.png\">:</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/fHefgraq286Dncap6CtTYgjI/black_hole_egan_alice_and_bob.png\" title=\":\"><img data-original-dimensions=\"1200x1000\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/21317/fHefgraq286Dncap6CtTYgjI/black_hole_egan_alice_and_bob.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div><p>Thus, “1” means no redshift at all, and smaller numbers means Alice looks <em>more</em> redshifted to Bob!</p>\n<p>So: Alice as seen by Bob becomes more and more redshifted as time goes by. She becomes infinitely redshifted at the exact instant Bob hits the singularity!</p>",

The quantity 2d is mentioned two paragraphs before in connection with smooth complex varieties, but the explanation of how one gets this quantity from a variety purely over a finite field is not clear. In particular, the fact the complex variety has complex dimension d, meaning the the variety in the theorem has dimension d, not 2d, is absent. </p>\n<p>Sorry to be a nitpicker! If you've edited this, I take it all back. But if not, is there still a chance to tweak it? For example \"Given a collection of polynomial equations with integer coefficients defining a smooth projective variety of dimension d\" would not change the pagination or any line breaks except the one immediately before the displayed double sum.</p>",

How many eggs come back to their original place, on average?</p>\n<p>One!</p>\n<p>What's the probability that exactly one gets back to its original place? This is a lot harder, because unlike the first question it really depends on the number \"12\". But the answer is close to 1/e. And if we did it for 100 eggs, or a million, the answer would get even closer to 1/e.</p>\n<p>What's the probability that exactly n eggs each get back to their original place? Now things get really interesting. The answer is complicated, but again it simplifies a lot in the limit where we permute a huge number of eggs. Then the answer approaches 1/e divided by n factorial.</p>\n<p>What's interesting about that? It's the same as the answer to <em>this</em> question: if you're standing in the rain, and on average one raindrop lands on your head every second, what's the probability that in one second exactly n raindrops land on your head? At least this is true if raindrops are falling randomly in the most reasonable way - a so-called 'Poisson distribution'.</p>\n<p>So random permutations are connected to Poisson distributions.

Above this surface, the solar wind becomes supersonic, so no disturbances in its flow can affect the Sun below.  So I had to learn about this and explain a bit of it.</p>\n<p>For starters, the 'sound' here is really Alfvén waves: coupled vibrations in the plasma and the magnetic field.

Position we must evidently acknowledge to be relative, for we cannot describe the position of a body in any terms which do not express relation… There are no landmarks in space; one portion of space is exactly like every other portion, so that we cannot tell where we are. We are, as it were, on an unruffled sea, without stars, compass, sounding, wind or tide, and we cannot tell in which direction we are going. We have no log which we can case out to take a dead reckoning by; we may compute our rate of motion with respect to the neighboring bodies, but we do not know how these bodies may be moving in space.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But he must have been talking about Galilean relativity!</p>",

But it wasn't so poetic.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Shut yourself up with some friend in the main cabin below decks on some large ship, and have with you there some flies, butterflies, and other small flying animals. Have a large bowl of water with some fish in it; hang up a bottle that empties drop by drop into a wide vessel beneath it. With the ship standing still, observe carefully how the little animals fly with equal speed to all sides of the cabin. The fish swim indifferently in all directions; the drops fall into the vessel beneath; and, in throwing something to your friend, you need to throw it no more strongly in one direction than another, the distances being equal; jumping with your feet together, you pass equal spaces in every direction. When you have observed all these things carefully (though doubtless when the ship is standing still everything must happen in this way), have the ship proceed with any speed you like, so long as the motion is uniform and not fluctuating this way and that. You will discover not the least change in all the effects named, nor could you tell from any of them whether the ship was moving or standing still. In jumping, you will pass on the floor the same spaces as before, nor will you make larger jumps toward the stern than toward the prow even though the ship is moving quite rapidly, despite the fact that during the time that you are in the air the floor under you will be going in a direction opposite to your jump. In throwing something to your companion, you will need no more force to get it to him whether he is in the direction of the bow or the stern, with yourself situated opposite. The droplets will fall as before into the vessel beneath without dropping toward the stern, although while the drops are in the air the ship runs many spans. The fish in their water will swim toward the front of their bowl with no more effort than toward the back, and will go with equal ease to bait placed anywhere around the edges of the bowl. Finally the butterflies and flies will continue their flights indifferently toward every side, nor will it ever happen that they are concentrated toward the stern, as if tired out from keeping up with the course of the ship, from which they will have been separated during long intervals by keeping themselves in the air. And if smoke is made by burning some incense, it will be seen going up in the form of a little cloud, remaining still and moving no more toward one side than the other. The cause of all these correspondences of effects is the fact that the ship's motion is common to all the things contained in it, and to the air also. That is why I said you should be below decks; for if this took place above in the open air, which would not follow the course of the ship, more or less noticeable differences would be seen in some of the effects noted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems</em>, translated by Stillman Drake, University of California Press, 1953, pp. 186 - 187 (Second Day).</p>",

A 'locally compact Hausdorff groupoid'?</p>\n<p>Even with a compact Hausdorff group there's the issue of normalizing the Haar measure.  We can normalize it so the integral over the whole group is 1, but the number 1 is not very exciting.

Say a <strong>2-rig</strong> is a cocomplete symmetric monoidal category enriched over abelian groups. Then any 2-rig R comes from an algebraic stack, and the groupoid of 'points' of this stack over a commutative ring k is the groupoid of 2-rig maps from R to kMod.   If our stack is a mere scheme, we get a mere set of points for each commutative ring k, and then we can use this technique to define the Hasse-Weil zeta function of the scheme: </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/johnbaez/show/Dirichlet+species+and+the+Hasse-Weil+zeta+function#hasseweil_species\">https://ncatlab.org/johnbaez/show/Dirichlet+species+and+the+Hasse-Weil+zeta+function#hasseweil_species</a> </p>\n<p>The idea is to define the 'Hasse-Weil species' of the scheme, a certain functor from the groupoid of finite sets to Set, and then decategorify it to get a Dirichlet series.  </p>\n<p>For a full-fledged algebraic stack we get a groupoid of points for each commutative ring k, and then instead of a Hasse-Weil species we get a Hasse-Weil 'stuff type', an analogously defined pseudofunctor from the groupoid of finite sets to Gpd. We should be able to still define a Dirichlet series from this, but this has not yet been worked out. </p>\n<p>Every 2-rig comes from an algebraic stack, but here we consider 2-rigs coming from algebraic stacks of two different kinds: affine schemes (which are not stacky at all), and affine algebraic groups (which can be seen as very stacky algebraic stacks with just one point). </p>\n<p>Any affine scheme gives a 2-rig as follows: the affine scheme corresponding to a commutative ring R gives the 2-rig of R-modules. We consider the cases R = ℤ[i] and R = ℤ[x]. </p>\n<p>Any affine algebraic group gives a 2-rig as follows: the affine algebraic group corresponding to a commutative Hopf algebra H gives the 2-rig of H-comodules. We consider the case where H is the commutative Hopf algebra of ℤ^G of ℤ-valued functions on a finite group G.  We focus on the case G = ℤ/3. </p>\n<p>For more on this whole series of conversations, go here: </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/conversations/\">https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/conversations/</a></p>",

A commutative algebraist studies commutative rings while an algebraic geometer might work in the opposite category and think of them as affine schemes. The algebraic side is more 'syntactical' while the geometric side is more 'semantic'. </p>\n<p>You might think the geometric interpretation of a 2-rig is typically some sort of 'categorified affine scheme', but that's not always true! For example, if you take the 2-rig of modules of a commutative ring R, its spectrum is the same as that of R. </p>\n<p>However, most 2-rigs aren't module categories of rings. Take a quasiprojective variety X and look at the 2-rig of quasicoherent sheaves on it, QCoh(X). When X is an affine variety QCoh(X) is equivalent to the 2-rig of modules of a ring, namely the ring R with Spec(R) ≅ X. But when X is a projective variety this is not true. </p>\n<p>The free commutative ring on one generator is ℤ[x]. If we think of this as a space it's the line, which is an affine scheme. Similarly, the 2-rig of modules of ℤ[x] is the 2-rig of quasicoherent sheaves on the line, which is an affine scheme. </p>\n<p>On the other hand, the free 2-rig on a line object is the 2-rig of ℤ-graded vector spaces, which is equivalent to the 2-rig of algebraic representations of the affine group scheme GL(1), or comodules of ℤ[x]. If we think of this 2-rig as a kind of 'space' it's the algebraic stack BGL(1). </p>\n<p>Next consider the free 2-rig on a line object equipped with a line object equipped with a monomorphism to I⊕I, where I is the tensor unit. The corresponding space is the projective line P¹. For details see: </p>\n<p>Martin Brandenburg, Tensor categorical foundations of algebraic geometry, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.1716\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.1716</a>. </p>\n<p>Also see Deligne's work on tensor categories, discussed here: </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Deligne%27s+theorem+on+tensor+categories\">https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Deligne%27s+theorem+on+tensor+categories</a> </p>\n<p>which shows that a large class of 2-rigs are categories of representations of supergroups, i.e. supercommutative Hopf algebras.  A more general attitude toward the 'Tannakian philosophy' also considers supergroupoids (coming from 'non-neutral' Tannakian categories, as defined in the above nLab article). </p>\n<p>For more on this whole series of conversations, go here: <a href=\"https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/conversations/\">https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/conversations/</a></p>",

The sheaves are the \"nice\" presheaves in the sense that if you sheafify them you get back what you started! And the etale spaces are the \"nice\" bundles in a similar sense, I guess.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, exactly!  That's a perfect example of what Jim is talking about.

Galois representations from torsion points on elliptic curves.</p>\n<p>Consider the 5-torsion points of the Gaussian elliptic curve. These 25 points form a discrete subvariety of the elliptic curve, which is a projective variety, but we can treat this subvariety as an affine variety, and since it's discrete it is the spectrum of a special commutative Frobenius algebra. Since the 5-torsion points form a group, this algebra also becomes a bicommutative Hopf algebra. But these 25 points are also naturally a 2-dimensional vector space over the finite field 𝔽₅, and because the Gaussian elliptic curve is defined over ℚ, this vector space gives a representation of the absolute Galois group of ℚ.</p>\n<p>Working with other elliptic curves and other primes ℓ, we get a map from the moduli stack of elliptic curves to the moduli stack of representations of the absolute Galois group of ℚ on 2d vector spaces over <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant=\"double-struck\">F</mi><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">ℓ</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathbb{F}_\\ell</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8389em;vertical-align:-0.15em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathbb\">F</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t vlist-t2\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.3361em;\"><span style=\"top:-2.55em;margin-left:0em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\">ℓ</span></span></span></span><span class=\"vlist-s\">​</span></span><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.15em;\"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>.

The hyperbolic plane is not itself a modular curve, but it has many quotients that are modular curves, for example X₀(2), X₀(4), X₀(8), etc., each being is a branched cover of the previous one. The modular curve X₀(n) is the hyperbolic plane modulo the action of the group Γ₀(n), the so-called 'Hecke congruence subgroup of level n', which consists of 2×2 integer matrices where the lower left entry equals 0 mod n. X₀(n) is the moduli space of elliptic curves with a chosen nontrivial n-torsion point. </p>\n<p>For congruence subgroups, see: </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://math.berkeley.edu/~sander/speaking/24June2015%20UMS%20Talk.pdf\">https://math.berkeley.edu/~sander/speaking/24June2015%20UMS%20Talk.pdf</a></p>",

But I really enjoy this process of \"learning by redoing\": it's a lot more fun than just reading books and absorbing the standard viewpoint on everything.

One reason is that it's a hydra-headed program: while popularizations calling it a \"grand unified theory of mathematics\" are hopelessly exaggerated, it does cover a lot of ground.

        "content": "<p>So the big questions are: what's a 'motivic L-function' and what's an 'automorphic L-function'?   </p>\n<p>I said an L-function amounts to a list of numbers that contains information about a mathematical object.  But not just any old object: it has to be a special sort of thing coming from number theory or algebraic geometry.  A motivic L-function comes from something called a 'motive', while an automorphic L-function comes from an 'automorphic representation'.</p>\n<p>So, to make progress on understanding the Langlands program, it helps to figure out what the hell 'motives' and 'automorphic representations' are.  </p>\n<p>Near the end of that video I showed you, the guy talking, Andreas Holmstrom, recommends this paper by Matthew Emerton:</p>\n<p>• Langlands reciprocity: L-functions, automorphic forms, and Diophantine equations, <a href=\"https://math.uchicago.edu/~emerton/pdffiles/reciprocity.pdf\">https://math.uchicago.edu/~emerton/pdffiles/reciprocity.pdf</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/5HcSAYIB63KW2Pb7zxBuMK8c/emerton_langlands_abstract.jpg\">.</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/5HcSAYIB63KW2Pb7zxBuMK8c/emerton_langlands_abstract.jpg\" title=\".\"><img data-original-content-type=\"image/jpeg\" data-original-dimensions=\"1044x647\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/21317/5HcSAYIB63KW2Pb7zxBuMK8c/emerton_langlands_abstract.jpg/840x560.webp\"></a></div><p>Emerton really helped me when I was trying to understand motivic L-functions, so I find it hilarious that Holmstrom says roughly \"If you were going to be stuck on an deserted island, and you could only bring one person with you, and you didn't care about love or friendship or survival, only learning about the Langlands program, who should you bring?  Matthew Emerton!\"</p>\n<p>This paper takes a historical approach.  That motivates the Langlands program very well.  But the complex winding course of history makes it hard to pick out a clean modern statement of (some tiny chunk of) what the Langlands program is trying to accomplish.   In particular, while I understand motives and their L-functions pretty well from a couple years of study, I'm still quite fuzzy about automorphic representations and <em>their</em> L-functions.   So I will need to put extra work into those.  </p>\n<p>(2/3)</p>",

        "content": "<p>One last little thing.    People often say something like \"every motivic L-function is an automorphic L-function, and vice versa\", which is an equation between two functions.  But how would you prove this?  </p>\n<p>Both L-functions are just summaries of information - one about a motive, another about an automorphic representation.   So you have to find a way to get from a motive to an automorphic representation, and vice versa.   And this is what people are trying to do.</p>\n<p>So it's a bit like what people in combinatorics call a 'bijective proof'.  You're trying to prove that two sequences of numbers are equal.  You show that the first sequence counts the number of gadgets with n elements.  You show the second counts the number of widgets with n elements.   And then you construct a one-to-one correspondence between gadgets with n elements and widgets with n elements!   That gets the job done - and it's also a deeper fact than the mere equation between sequences of numbers.   </p>\n<p>Category theorists call this 'categorification': instead of proving an equation, you set up an isomorphism, or an equivalence of categories.</p>\n<p>This is the attitude I instinctively take when people say \"every motivic L-function is an automorphic L-function, and vice versa\".   But I don't understand the details yet!   I can explain motives in a simple way:</p>\n<p>• Motivating motives, <a href=\"https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/motives/\">https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/motives/</a></p>\n<p>but not automorphic representations.</p>\n<p>My friend Bruce Bartlett explained the correspondence in a special case called the Modularity Theorem:</p>\n<p>• The Modularity Theorem as a bijection of sets, <a href=\"https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2024/04/the_modularity_theorem_as_a_bi.html\">https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2024/04/the_modularity_theorem_as_a_bi.html</a></p>\n<p>So that's a place to start, though you'll instantly be tested on your knowledge of elliptic curves and modular forms!</p>",

So, in the same way that currently the UN can (in principle) use sanctions, economic pressure, and eventually the threat of an international military intervention to \"police\" violations of human rights, the same instruments could be used to police the violations of the right to exit; but no sanction should exist for any \"internal matters\".<br>\nThis doesn't guarantee efficacy but the point is, it's not <em>less effective</em> in principle than the system we have (or at least used to have).</p>",

Sadly, most current models are labour intensive to build, difficult to reuse or adapt, and reliant on proprietary software.  Our team has used modern mathematics to develop flexible open-source frameworks for \"stock and flow models\", which treat populations en masse, and also \"agent-based models\" or \"ABMs\" which simulate each individual separately.  In our meeting we will develop new mathematics and create new software to design and work with \"hybrid\" models which combine stock and flow models and ABMs.  To illustrate the power of this new software, we will create demonstration models of 1) gestational and type II diabetes, 2) labour shocks as the economy decarbonizes.  Our team includes mathematicians, software engineers, computer scientists who specialize in epidemiology and public health, and an economist.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here's the whole proposal in case anyone cares:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/QSAVNI5Sc3AhLIzn_27vvahc/ICMS_2025_Application.pdf\">Toward hybrid modeling</a>.</li>\n</ul>",

Multiplying the signs along a directed path of edges lets us determine indirect positive or negative effects, and if the path is a loop we call this a positive or negative feedback loop. Here we generalize this to graphs with edges labeled by a commutative monoid, whose elements represent \"polarities\" possibly more general than simply \"positive\" or \"negative\". We define a \"1st homology monoid\" of a directed graph, different from the usual 1st homology group in that it only detects directed loops. Finally, we describe the emergence of new feedback loops when we compose open graphs using a variant of the Mayer-Vietoris exact sequence for homology. This is joint work with Adittya Chaudhuri.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I will show the essential “under the hood” machinery of a versatile framework for the control of nonequilibrium systems with internal driving, that exhibit discrete and continuous states. The framework combines recent developments in stochastic thermodynamics and response theory. I will then briefly present proofs of concepts of this framework, through the solution of a semi-analytical one-body control problem, involving a trapped active particle, and a many-body control problem involving active collectives that phase separate.</p>\n</blockquote>",

The paper claims they made things better from 49 to 48 field multiplications, but such an algorithm was posted on math.SE as an answer in 2014..... And someone tells me results from the late 60s from before the famous Strassen approach was enough for the 4x4 case to give 48 field multiplications, even though the Strassen result would scale to larger matrices by iteration, being possible with non-commutative ring entries (and this is how the 49 mults were arrived at).</p>\n<p>Maybe, to be charitable, the DeepMind paper should have said it betters Strassen's technique to arrive at 48 mults using tensor decompositions, rather than just saying it beat this old count and that it \"was an open problem\" for n decades (50ish years, from memory, is what the paper claims), merely to beat this number at all, by any means.</p>",

While this model of a fluid is so oversimplified that von Neumann jokingly called it the theory of “dry water”, it is mathematically rich, so it should be interesting to attempt to quantize the Euler equations. If this is possible, it would give a theory of a quantum ideal fluid. If impossible, there should be some mathematically interesting reason why it cannot be done.</p>\n<p>V. I. Arnol’d showed that the Euler equations describe geodesic motion on a certain infinite-dimensional Lie group, the group of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of space. Using this fact he showed that the Euler equations in 2-dimensional space are “chaotic”: small changes in the initial conditions lead to exponentially growing changes in what happens later on. This mathematical description may also be the key to an elegant quantization of the Euler equations.</p>\n<p>A large part of this project will consist of studying the existing literature on the Euler equations and attempts to quantize them. A bare minimum goal would be to write a clear summary of the state of the art.

To use a particularly marked example that you'll sometimes see featured in the System Dynamics community, a reinforcing feedback exhibiting instability in an unfavourable direction can be called a \"vicious cycle\", while that same feedback heading in a favourable direction could in some cases be termed a \"virtuous cycle\".  In my introductory lecture on causal loop diagrams at an undergraduate or graduate level, I oft note examples of balancing feedbacks that are desirable (certain homeostatic feedbacks and psychodynamic feedbacks come to mind), but others that can be entrapping.  I also note reinforcing feedbacks that are widely viewed unfavourably (e.g., spread of a pathogen within a population, a conspiracy theory), and others that (rightly or wrongly!) people actively pursue (growing a company, or one's content  that \"goes viral\".

Often the model proper and the observation processes are mixed in a way that's difficult to disentangle, leading ultimately to a lot of dead code that nobody dares delete.</p>\n<p>Here I'm pontificating about this issue<a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/3nzg4UoiJOQH6QUttS-Id-Lt/8C4A1901-EF2F-425E-A5AE-940086029AF3.jpg\">:</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/21317/3nzg4UoiJOQH6QUttS-Id-Lt/8C4A1901-EF2F-425E-A5AE-940086029AF3.jpg\" title=\":\"><img data-original-content-type=\"image/jpeg\" data-original-dimensions=\"4032x3024\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/21317/3nzg4UoiJOQH6QUttS-Id-Lt/8C4A1901-EF2F-425E-A5AE-940086029AF3.jpg/840x560.webp\"></a></div><p>This group consists of <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"318832\">@Nathaniel Osgood</span>, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"275965\">@Evan Patterson</span>, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"302073\">@Kris Brown</span>, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"280769\">@Xiaoyan Li</span>, <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"732148\">@Owen Haaga</span>, and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"405160\">@ww</span> and his colleagues <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"779285\">@Sándor Bartha</span>  and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"927836\">@Akindele Onifade</span>.</p>\n<p>I've been talking to Owen trying to help him come up with hybrid models that are good for labor economics, starting with some very simple toy models.   Economists tend to use models in different ways from epidemiologists, so this is broadening our scope of concerns in eye-opening ways.</p>\n<p>Shortly after this project ends on June 26, 2025, I'm going to Athens from June 28 to July 4 to give some lectures.   I don't really want to be flying around, but I'm so happy to be in Europe that when <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"276985\">@Christina Vasilakopoulou</span> invited me, I failed to resist the opportunity to give a minicourse in a Summer School on Algebra at the Zografou campus of the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA).    The summer school will cover some topics from representation theory, model-theoretic universal algebra, and combinatorics.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>Counting with Categories</h4>\n<p>Many questions in enumerative combinatorics ask us to count the number of structures of some sort on an <em>n</em>-element set, as a function of <em>n</em>. But what is a \"structure of some sort\"? This is made precise by Joyal's theory of species. This theory also clarifies a simple yet powerful technique for counting structures on finite sets, namely generating functions. We shall see that the category of species is the \"free 2-rig on one generator\", and that combinatorially interesting operations on generating functions arise from this fact. Thus, a large chunk of enumerative combinatorics can be seen as a branch of categorified ring theory. We hope to strike a balance between abstract theory and fun concrete examples of counting problems.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Near as I can tell in the data, there is no information about how the interface between the embedded pathway and the one you are looking at. There are three things in the data: an enclosing pathway (the whole picture), \"entries\" which are vertices and contain information about layout on the screen, and \"relations\" which are edges between entries.</p>\n<p>Entries have a \"type\"  which is typically \"gene\" or \"compound\"  or \"group\". A \"group\" is just a shorthand for a bunch of genes, like the \"pro-apoptotic genes\" on the right. But another type of entry is a \"map\" which means an embedded pathway. These ones do not seem to figure in relations at all, they are just placed there on the screen with nothing to say how they are hooked in. </p>\n<p>So, take the p53 signalling pathway. In the apoptosis diagram, the p53 gene is connected to DNA which lead to a bunch of pro-apoptotic genes. In the p53 signalling pathway diagram, the p53 gene also appears, and again is connected to DNA which leads to a bunch of genes that include some but not all of those mentioned in the apoptosis diagram. The apoptosis diagram is mentioned, but appears all the way to the right, several hops downstream.</p>\n<p>Is taking the union of all these nearby diagrams and identifying the genes (which have identifiers so that's easy) the right thing to do? What about the dashed lines, the indirect links? These involve what looks like text in the diagram but is really pictures of text that doesn't appear in the data itself.</p>\n<p>I would be inclined to filter out all of the indirect links and work only with identifiable things...</p>",

As of now, I found the paper <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.02822\">Applied Category Theory for Genomics\n– An Initiative</a> along this direction, especially, if you look at section 3.3, where they talked about possible applications of ACT on geneomic data to tackle its heterogenosity and diverseness. However, I feel this paper is not exactly an ACT paper, and looks more like a biology/ biological philosophy paper which proposes a research direction about the application of ACT in genomics. I will search more  if there exists any other papers in the direction of integrative bioinformatics. Also, may be David Spivak's works on categorical database theory may be helpful for the purpose of integrarive bioinformatics.</p>",

In principle this is Description Logic (e.g. OWL) territory but actually using this language in anger never really caught on. Partly because the underlying RDF language is a bit weird and clunky and partly because doing DL inference on larger datasets is expensive. So, we have these big datasets, like Uniprot and the Gene Ontology and so forth that are written in RDF but don't actually use most of the available logic or, in some cases, even publish in the expected way.</p>\n<p>So the community has heavily invested in the RDF substrate for publishing data but cherry-picked those bits of it that are convenient and left the rest aside. Each sub-community has cherry-picked a little differently. And there's historical artefacts of the development process that can be seen. For example, if you look at an SBML file, you will see XML stuff and then RDF/XML fragments stuffed into various places. This is because when SBML started, they weren't convinced by RDF, and then they decided it was necessary but since they already had an XML format, they thought to just stuff the least convenient RDF serialisation in places. It's not clean design, it's design that has evolved over a couple of decades through committees...</p>",

        "content": "<p>We did some work, jesus, it's 10 years ago now, on annotation of rule-based models (by which I mean graph rewriting). The idea there was to have a way (probably a functor) of relating the schema of the rewriting system to a schema in RDF in order to facilitate model composition. If you want to compose models, you need to be able to identify objects at least, and you can do this if you can say that they correspond to some standard thing in Uniprot, GO, etc.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, for some types of objects, we know, in principle, the general shape of the rules that they should obey. For example, ribosomes bind to particular codons and slide along, producing the corresponding RNA polymer from the coding sequences until they hit a stop codon, then a similar process operates on the RNA polymer to produce proteins. This is the basic machinery that we have regardless of the specific sequence. So, by knowing that we have a specific sequence, we can generate the rules to produce a model for it.</p>\n<p>We didn't express this in categorical language mostly because I didn't know any categorical language at the time...</p>\n<p>Here, we want to produce causal loop diagrams for gene regulatory networks rather than rule-based models, but a similar setup could work.</p>",

I think most diagrams created via cell designer use a mix of SBGN-PD and SBGN-AF format for example the database <em>Reactome</em>, <em>AIR</em>, etc. However, the databases like KEGG is also linked to SBML as mentioned in  <a href=\"https://www.celldesigner.org/models.html\">cell designer</a> , but I think KEGG  diagrams are not drawn in SBGN style.  I think  quite a large amount of biological information is now a days stored via cell designer and mostly as combinations of  SBGN-PD and SBGN-AF  (i.e. in an hybrid way).</p>",

It's probably better to read the whole interview.   I conclude:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It’s hard to know what to do with my life if these things are true, because my life was based on other assumptions. I also believe there’s a decent chance I can eke out a comfortable existence for a couple more decades without dramatically changing my behavior (apart from moving to Scotland). But it would be silly not to update my assumptions, state this publicly, and take it from there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It sounds like Suzuki, too, was reluctant to say publicly what he’s now come to believe. But I’m glad he’s come out and said it. If the basic outlines are correct, there’s a lot to do, and no point in staying quiet about it, even if we don’t yet have the courage and energy to change our lives as the situation calls for.</p>\n</blockquote>",

        "content": "<p>I’m always confused when I see a new maximally negative statement about climate like this, because while of course there’s lots and lots of bad stuff happening to the Earth, it’s seemed to me like the great majority of the news in the 21st century has been very good relative to the ‘90s baseline. US emissions are the lowest they’ve been in my lifetime, coal is basically economically dead, solar is the best power source in many situations, the terrifying 8.5 degree warming scenarios that filled my nightmares in 2005 are now out of the question, electric cars are fantastic, China is moving really rather vigorously toward electrification; all of this is great news that would have deeply surprised my 2000-era self! On the other hand, Trump is really bad. But again, “republicans hate the climate” has been true for decades, and that hasn’t stopped really rather substantial progress. Certainly, I expect the world to warm 2.5 degrees by my old age and for that to be really bad. Is it therefore “too late to save our civilization?” What, exactly does that even mean, and how did people discover such fine grained parameterization of the prospects of a whole civilization that they can distinguish between the safety of 1.5 degrees and the doom of 2.5? </p>\n<p>What’s most frustrating about this discourse is (1) it plays into a profoundly pessimistic, even nihilistic tendency among many of today’s educated classes that is highly nonconducive to working to make things as good as possible, independently of how bad they actually are (2) the tendency to make broad, highly confident predictive claims on the basis of research that itself makes almost no predictive claims at all. I read the most recent work on the “nine planetary boundaries” that is all I see Suzuki citing, and it’s interesting and important and makes <em>no concrete predictions whatsoever</em> except temperature ones, which we already knew about! It’s not news that we are driving many terrestrial systems outside of their Holocene norms, is it? So what new information, other than “trump got reelected”, is really driving such despondent commentary? Honestly, I wish you wouldn’t post things about having no hope for the future. Those of us who are expecting to have to deal with most of this century, however it turns out, don’t need the extra burden.</p>",

I also don't think Suzuki was saying anything dramatically new has occurred recently: he says \"it’s been coming all along.\"   It's true that the rise of pro-carbon-burning, climate-change-denying authoritarian rule in the US makes it harder to imagine bright futures.   But more fundamentally the problem is that the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, deforestation, biodiversity loss, etc. keep increasing quite rapidly.</p>\n<p>This is not new.    I think what's new is that Suzuki got tired of not saying what he actually believes.  That's what's happening to me, anyway - not a big change in my actual assessment of the situation.</p>\n<p>I'm familiar with the argument that it's better to shut up because saying what I believe would be demoralizing.  Suzuki must be even more familiar with that argument, being a bigshot \"environmental activist\". </p>\n<p>Maybe it's better to say what we actually believe, so we can go from there, either taking action that's more realistic to the situation at hand, or getting into a productive argument with people who have more optimistic assessments.   </p>\n<p>As for me, my dark assessment of the future isn't making me \"give up\", but it does make me want to rethink where I'm putting my energy.   Too much of my activity presumes a kind of future that seems unlikely to happen.</p>\n<p>By the way, I think the most productive argument here would not be about \"whether or not we're doomed\", or even \"how bad will things get\", but what we should do.</p>",

Here I explain how this works.   I show how the Kepler problem can be rephrased in terms of a free particle moving around on a sphere in 4-dimensional space.   Then I rephrase the Kepler problem in terms of a massless, relativistic free particle moving at the speed of light on a sphere in 4-dimensional space.   This sets the stage for even more shocking developments to come.</p>",

Today we'll 'second quantize’ both of these equivalent theories and get new theories that again are equivalent.   </p>\n<p>'Second quantization' is a funny term.  It's a completely systematic way to get a new quantum theory from an old one.  When you second quantize the theory of some particle, you get a theory that describes noninteracting collections of that kind of particle.   So, when we second quantize the theory of a hydrogen atom, we get a theory that describes collections of electrons orbiting the nucleus - but in a simplified way, where the electrons do not interact.  When we second quantize the theory of a  massless left-handed spin-&frac12; particle in the Einstein universe, we get a theory of noninteracting collections of such particles.  This is called a 'free quantum field theory': it's the easiest sort of quantum field theory to understand.</p>\n<p>So, there's a relationship between multi-electron atoms and a free quantum field theory on the Einstein universe!</p>",

Remember that homotopy cardinality assigns a nonnegative rational number to any <strong>tame</strong> homotopy type - a homotopy type with finitely many connected components, each of which has only finitely many nonzero homotopy groups, all of which are finite groups.    The formula for homotopy cardinality is <a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/groupoid+cardinality#InfingroupoidCardinality\">here</a>.   Ramzy has uniquely characterized homotopy cardinality given a few axioms including </p>\n<ol>\n<li>invariance under weak homotopy equivalence, </li>\n<li>additivity under finite coproducts and</li>\n<li>multiplicativity under fibrations (if <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>F</mi><mo>→</mo><mi>E</mi><mo>→</mo><mi>B</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">F \\to E \\to B</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.13889em;\">F</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">→</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.05764em;\">E</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">→</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.05017em;\">B</span></span></span></span> is a fibration with connected base <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>B</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">B</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.05017em;\">B</span></span></span></span> and fiber <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>F</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">F</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.13889em;\">F</span></span></span></span>, then the cardinality of <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>E</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">E</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.05764em;\">E</span></span></span></span> is the cardinality of <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>B</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">B</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.05017em;\">B</span></span></span></span> times the cardinality of <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>F</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">F</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.13889em;\">F</span></span></span></span>).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These may be the only axioms needed - I forget.

For examples of putting this theory to work, see [baez2018compositional; baez2016compositional; baez2017compositional]. This was later expanded by Kenny Courser and John Baez to a theory of structured cospans in [Baez.Courser:Structured.Cospans] (see [Baez.Courser.Vasilakopolou:Structured.vs.Decorated] for a detailed comparison between these approaches). John Baez and his students have used these theories in a variety of settings; see for example [Baez.Master:Open.Petri.Nets; Baez.Courser:Open.Markov.Processes].</p>\n</blockquote>",

At this time Fairbanks, Patterson and other were developing Catlab [25], a framework for applied and computational category theory, written in the Julia language. It was natural to use this to create models of the spread of disease using open Petri nets with rates. In 2020, Patterson wrote the first version of structured cospans in Catlab, specifically so that Halter and Fairbanks could implement open whole-grain Petri nets [70]. This became a piece of software called AlgebraicPetri [3], which takes advantage of another piece of software based on Catlab, called AlgebraicDynamics [2]. The latter can work with open dynamical systems in either the variable sharing paradigm or the input-output paradigm.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This work attracted the attention of some computer scientists who are experts on public health, such as Osgood and Li, who helped run COVID modeling for the government of Canada. These experts pointed out that in epidemiological modeling, ‘stock and flow models’ are more widely used than Petri nets with rates.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm leaving out many details, and I don't know most of them, but I hope I'm getting basic the chronology right:</p>",

Such work is properly just a minor part of this description, but because you are seeking feedback on the description, I'd note that our COVID modeling and reporting was conducted for Canadian federal, provincial, and local authorities.   The term \"government of Canada\" is the specific term used to refer to the federal administration; we did indeed conducting lines of work for multiple agencies of the federal government, but a huge amount of modeling and reporting also went on at the provincial &amp; territorial, with some also at the local level.  Healthcare in Canada is a provincial responsibility, and my direct reporting was to and salary was paid by our provincial health authority and Ministry of Health.  It's also a minor matter, but rather than saying \"computer scientists who are experts on public health\", you might want to use the term \"computational epidemiologists\".  </p>\n<p>For what it is worth, we first decided that we wanted to make use of Catlab when <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"280769\">@Xiaoyan Li</span> , <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"319188\">@Winchell Qian</span> , and I were taking the course \"Programming with Categories\" by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"276049\">@David Spivak</span> , <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"276053\">@Brendan Fong</span> and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"275991\">@Bartosz Milewski</span> at MIT, and we heard <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"275965\">@Evan Patterson</span> talk for the MIT Category Theory seminar, and had a chance to talk with Evan.  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"275927\">@James Fairbanks</span> also visited shortly thereafter, and kindly agreed to lunch, built my conviction that we needed to apply Catlab within our work -- and, if possible, in our COVID modeling.  Thanks to foundational work by <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"319188\">@Winchell Qian</span> and his flagging of our lab's need to work on addressing the challenge of the new virus the same day that Wuhan went into lockdown, we were already closely following what became COVID-19 at the time of these meetings, and were convinced that we needed categorical tools to supplement our plans.   My own secondment of me and that of a large fraction of our lab to the health system took place less than a month later, and our learning of the requisite category theory built slowly, but our work in the ensuing months illustrated ever more clearly and profoundly these lines of work needed categorical affordances and tools, particularly in the context of a rapidly evolving pandemic.</p>\n<p>This is probably far more feedback that you were seeking, but I thought that I would offer that context and clarifications, in case it is of help.</p>",

We focus on the variable sharing paradigm, where we compose open systems by identifying variables. This paradigm is often implemented using structured or decorated cospans. We explain this approach using three main examples: open Petri nets, open dynamical systems, and open Petri nets with rates. We compare the virtues of structured and decorated cospan double categories, and study their common features. We show that any symmetric monoidal structured or decorated cospan double category comes with maps from two simpler double categories: its ‘exoskeleton’ and its ‘outer shell’. Finally, we study the concept of ‘hypergraph double category’, a kind of double category that should subsume structured and decorated cospans in a common framework for studying open systems in the variable sharing paradigm.</p>\n</blockquote>",

This is more realistic than the basic Schrödinger equation that ignores spin, but less realistic than a full-fledged relativistic treatment using the Dirac equation. It’s a pretty good approximation. We saw that bound states of this hydrogen atom can be reinterpreted as states of a massless left-handed spin-1/2 particle in the Einstein universe—a universe where space is the 3-sphere.</p>\n<p>Then I ‘second quantized’ both theories. If we do this to the massless spin-1/2 particle, we get a free quantum field theory on the Einstein universe! This describes arbitrary collections of noninteracting massless spin-1/2 particles. If we second quantize the hydrogen atom, we get a theory of multi-electron atoms—but a naive theory where the electrons don’t interact. In this naive theory we don’t get the periodic table of elements. But I show how to tweak the Hamiltonian so we <em>do</em> get the observed periodic table, at least roughly.</p>",

The most important example is the nonzero octonions under multiplication: they're like a group, but they're not associative, but they obey some mysteriously powerful identities that make them much better.   To the nLab page I added Conway and Smith's conceptual definition of a Moufang loop, not just the usual definition in terms of these mysterious identities.

My talk is at room 3.01, 40 George Square. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>Software for compositional modeling</h4>\n<p>Many epidemiologists use “stock and flow diagrams” to describe ordinary differential equation (ODE) models of disease dynamics. This talk introduces the mathematics of stock and flow diagrams and two software tools for working with them. The first, called StockFlow.jl, is based on category theory and written in AlgebraicJulia. The second, called ModelCollab, runs on a web browser and serves as a graphical user interface for StockFlow.jl. Modelers often regard diagrams as an informal step toward a mathematically rigorous formulation of a model in terms of ODEs. However, stock and flow diagrams have a precise mathematical syntax. Formulating this syntax using category theory has many advantages, but I will focus on three: functorial semantics, model composition, and model stratification. This is joint work with Xiaoyan Li, Sophie Libkind, Nathaniel Osgood, Evan Patterson and Eric Redekopp.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tuesday October 28 - Saturday November 1, 2025 - I will be visiting Jamie Vicary at Cambridge University.  I am giving a talk in Computer Science at 2 pm on Friday October 31st.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>Cospans of finite sets</h4>\n<p>Cospans of finite sets are the morphisms in a bicategory, not really a category, because composition of cospans is associative only up to natural isomorphism. How can we characterize this bicategory abstractly? There's a category of finite sets and <em>isomorphism classes</em> of cospans, and Steve Lack gave a beautiful characterization of this, which I will explain. But what about the bicategory?

My instructions: \"As a brief note on the format that we are experimenting with this term, we would like the first ~50 minutes to be a pedagogical blackboard talk, and after a quick break, with refreshments, we’ll reconvene for a ~30 minute informal discussion centred on the more practical aspects of being an academic. This could include other endeavours (organisational, pedagogical, etc.) that you might be involved in beyond strict research.\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>Before and after the cobordism hypothesis</h4>\n<p>In 1995, James Dolan and I formulated a series of \"hypotheses\" about topology and higher categories, before the theory of higher categories was sufficiently developed to make these into precisely stated conjectures. In 2009 Jacob Lurie reformulated one of these using infinity-categories, called it the \"cobordism hypothesis\", and gave a 111-page outline of a proof. Simply put, the cobordism hypothesis gives a purely algebraic description of smooth manifolds, helpful for constructing topological quantum field theories. I'll say a bit about what led Dolan and me to this hypothesis, what it says, why it's useful, and why I quit working on it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>",

Here I start explaining why the Standard Model has U(1) × SU(2) × SU(3) as its symmetry group. But I don't assume you know anything about groups or quantum mechanics! So I have to start at the beginning: how the electromagnetic, weak, and strong force are connected to the numbers 1, 2, and 3. It's all about quunits, qubits and qutrits.</p>\n<p>You've heard of bits, which describe a binary alternative, like 0 and 1. You've probably heard about qubits, which are the quantum version of bits. The weak force is connected to qubits where the 2 choices are called \"isospin up\" and \"isospin down\". The most familiar example is the choice between a proton and a neutron. A better example is the choice between an up quark and a down quark.</p>\n<p>The strong force is connected to qutrits - the quantum version of a choice between 3 alternatives. In physics these are whimsically called \"red\", \"green\" and \"blue\". Quarks come in 3 colors like this.</p>\n<p>The electromagnetic force is connected to \"quunits\" - the quantum version of a choice between just one alternative. It may seem like that's no choice at all! But quantum mechanics is weird: there's just one choice, but you can still rotate that choice.</p>\n<p>Yes, I know this stuff sounds crazy. But this is how the world actually works. I start explaining it here, and I'll keep on until it's all laid out quite precisely.</p>",

Today I finally got to meet him - and it's great!  He convinced me that in music theory we really want to treat isomorphisms of groupoids as better than equivalences (at least sometimes).  I have a trick for reconciling this with the principle of equivalence.

Early in the twenty first century it became clear that many existing models were orbifolds, quotients of Rⁿ (known to musicians as \"n-note ordered pitch space\") by various symmetry groups (e.g. the \"OPTI\" symmetries containing octave shifts, permutations, translations and reflections). Recently, however, it has become clear that some closely related musical models are not orbifolds, either because the parent space is inherently discrete or because the symmetry group does not act properly discontinuously. Music theorists thus need to be able to work with a wider range of quotients. My talk will survey some of the fascinating interactions between geometry and music, and will describe a new and more comprehensive framework using groupoids.</p>\n<p>Online: <a href=\"https://ed-ac-uk.zoom.us/j/88480730026\">https://ed-ac-uk.zoom.us/j/88480730026</a></p>\n<p>Password: higgs_20</p>",

        "content": "<p>A book I really like that resonates with this talk is David Lewin's \"Generalized musical intervals and transformations\". A \"Generalized musical interval\" is just a Torsor. He generalizes musical intervals to a wide variety of examples. If you restrict the Torsors to sounds and rhythms that are hearable or playable you get groupoids. I need to finish the book, because he tries to go farther with \"transformations\".</p>\n<p>Lewin's analysis beautifully illustrates how ideas like those in the talk help interpret music.</p>\n<p>An aside, there's this old tension between perfect symmetry and near perfect symmetry in art that Hermann Weyl does a good job exploring in his book \"Symmetry\". For example, Ancient art used to commonly have perfect bilateral symmetry. But eventually artists started having fun exploring how one might change an image after applying some symmetry.</p>\n<p>So in a painting, on one half Jesus is holding bread, but on the other he's holding wine. A viewer would easily be able to spot the difference and see a narrative.</p>\n<p>In this talk Tymoczko mentioned a related tension. A song that perfectly fit a pattern would sound pedantic. There needed to be \"variations from a theme\" for \"interest\". Which is a common nuisance when reverse engineering the symmetries.</p>\n<p>Here's my take on what's going on. You can \"exactly\" share an image, or song, by moving it. By moving the paper, or playing the same song somewhere else. These are the primordial group actions, and define what \"the same\" means in art. The copy and paste operation in music software, referenced in the talk, is an example of this.</p>\n<p>When you have access to \"the same\", then you also have \"difference\". Differences, by definition, will be felt or perceived, which can be used in many creative ways. Therefore deviations from symmetry are interesting.</p>\n<p><em>Nonlinear</em> sound amplification, creates \"interesting\" distortion because it's failing to reproduce the timbre of the instrument, etc.</p>\n<p>Thanks for sharing the talk, I'll have to think more about the example quotienting a torus by a circle.</p>",

How can we characterize this bicategory abstractly? There's a category of finite sets and isomorphism classes of cospans. Steve Lack gave a beautiful characterization of this, which I will explain, and Fong and Spivak used this category to clarify the concept of \"hypergraph category\". But what about the bicategory of finite sets, cospans, and maps between cospans? I will state a guess that I haven't proved.</p>",

Here are some more specific goals:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Get a written problem list from a bunch of modelling experts, i.e. statements of the form \"I'll be interested in categorical approaches to modelling when they can do X\", or \"how would category theory think about this specific dynamical behaviour, or is this actually not a category theory question at all?\", or ... and so on.</p>\n<p>Make academic friends. These are people who are not at all category theorists (many of them haven't even heard of the subject) but who have elected to spend 5 days at a working conference to actually work with some category theorists.</p>\n<p>There will probably be a lot of conversations that are essentially 5–15 minute speed tutorials in \"what is agro-ecology\", or \"how do diabetes models work\", or \"what does it mean to implement climate data in a non-trivial way\".

        "content": "<p>Not work but fun: I'm reading <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_Is_No_Antimemetics_Division\">There is No Antimemetics Division</a></em>.   I'll quote a bit:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Item #: SCP-3125</p>\n<p>Object Class: Keter</p>\n<p>Special Containment Procedures: SCP-3125 is kept inside<br>\nCognitohazard Containment Unit 3125 on the first floor of Site 41. </p>\n<p>This containment unit is a 10m by 15m by 3m cuboidal room clad in layers of lead, soundproofing and telepathic shielding. Access is through an airlock system at one end of the containment unit. This airlock is programmed to allow only one person to enter the containment unit at a time, and to remain locked until this person exits before allowing another person to enter.</p>\n<p>Under no circumstances may any coherent information be allowed to leave the containment unit. This includes written and electronic notes, photographs, audio and video recordings, sound, electromagnetic and particle-based signals and psi emanations. During the exit cycle, a purge system rigged to the airlock flushes the occupant's memory by flooding the airlock with amnestic gas for three minutes.</p>\n<p>A senior Antimemetics Division staff member must visit SCP-3125 every six weeks (42 days).</p>\n<p>END OF FILE</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"You're kidding me. That's the whole entry?\"</p>\n<p>\"That's the whole entry,\" Wheeler says.</p>\n<p>It isn't even the fiftieth strangest thing Paul Kim has seen in the database, but still: \"No description, no acquisition report, no test log, no addenda? No clue who built the unit, or when, or how many times it's been visited, or who carried out the previous visits, or what they took in with them, or how long they were in there?\"</p>\n<p>\"Well, obviously Bart Hughes built the unit,\" Wheeler says, and this cannot be denied. The man's signature style of containment architecture is recognisable a mile out. Sleek, white, plainly impregnable without the aid of extremely heavy tools. \"Which makes it at least seven years old. That's sixty visits or more. I guess there are good reasons for the rest of those omissions. Anyway... the timer watchdog says it's time again.\"</p>\n<p>\"I don't like the idea of you routinely exposing yourself to a cognitohazard so dangerous that we can't even write the reason why we can't write it down down,\" Kim says. \"Especially because it's impossible for us to recover any usable information this way. You're going to go in, be incommunicado for two hours and come out a smiling amnesiac. What do we gain from that? It's just a breach risk.\"</p>\n<p>Wheeler hears every word of this and elects to ignore it all. There's a vague shape of familiarity about the entry as written; there are a few word choices which reassure her, in an intangible way, that it was written by someone who knew what they were doing. Possibly her.</p>\n<p>Kim's still talking. \"We should just scrub that last line from the database entry. There can't be anything good in that room.\"</p>\n<p>Wheeler puts her keycard in the slot. The airlock rewards her with  green LEDs and begins to cycle open. It's built as a slender vertical cylinder with a single opening. The entire thing rotates on its axis. Inside, there's barely room for a single person to stand without their shoulders touching the walls.</p>\n<p>\"What are you taking?\" Kim asks.</p>\n<p>Wheeler ducks to step in, turns to face him and shrugs. \"A stick of gum.\"</p>\n<p>\"I can get you field gear,\" Kim says, as the airlock begins to rotate again, emitting a low, quiet thrum solely as an audible warning that there is machinery in motion. \"We'll raid inventory. Give me fifteen minutes and I'll turn you into a one-woman war.\"</p>\n<p>If Wheeler says anything in response to this, it's cut off by the soundproofing as the airlock rotates.</p>\n<p>Kim is left alone in the antechamber. He stares at the outer door for a worried moment. He presses his ear to the door for a while, but heas nothing. Not even a faint tremble from the airlock mechanism.</p>\n<p>Inside it's pitch dark for a few seconds, then some unseen sensor detects Wheeler's presence and brings the fluorescents up. Half of them, anyway. The others remain inert or flicker aggravatingly.</p>\n<p>The room's interior walls are made from milky white glass (bulletproof, knowing Hughes) and plastered with paperwork, taped and Blu-Tacked up in vaguely coherent masses. Where there is no paperwork, people have drawn directly on the walls in marker pen. There is a conference table, long and elliptical, covered with more paperwork and a tangle of laptop computers and serpentine power supply cables. Power has returned to the machines and they are slowly booting. A data projector warms up and shines a map of the world over the far wall, almost lining up with a network of scribbled annotations on the same wall. Post-It notes of all colours litter the carpet like autumn leaves.  </p>\n<p>Other than that, the room is empty.</p>\n<p>Skimming the paperwork, Wheeler discovers that nearly all of it is handwritten and most of it charts the progress of conversations. Most of the entries are dated and signed, and most of the dates are weeks apart. The conversations are panicked and fearful back-and-forths about dozens of SCPs, some of them antimemetic in nature but none of them obviously related to one another. None of the notes mention SCP-3125.</p>\n<p>The only name Wheeler recognises is her own, which appears on one in ten or twenty of the notes. The notes seem authentic and the handwriting is hers. But her notes also seem as desperate and uncertain in tone as everybody else's. This unnerves her.</p>\n<p>There are diagrams on the walls too, which are too complex to decode at a glance, but complex enough to make her eyes hurt to look at them. Still lost for a logical entry point to the data, Wheeler curses all of her predecessors. Asynchronous research — whereby the research topic is forgotten entirely between iterations, and rediscovered over and over — is a perfectly standard practice in the Antimemetics Division, and her people ought to be better trained than this. There should be an obvious single document to read first which makes sense of the rest. A primer—</p>\n<p>\"Marion, it's me.\"</p>\n<p>Wheeler recognises the voice as her own. She moves around the table until she finds the laptop making the noise. There's a video playing, apparently recorded on the laptop's own camera in this room.</p>\n<p>The Marion Wheeler in the video is seated, and looks unfamiliar in a way which takes the one watching a moment to put her finger on. Not exhausted, not sick, not physically injured; she's seen herself that way before, in the mirror. This woman's willpower is gone. She's beaten.</p>\n<p>\"You've guessed already that SCP-3125 is not in this room,\" she says. \"In fact, this is the only room in the world where SCP-3125 is not present. It's called 'inverted containment'. SCP-3125 pervades all of reality except for volumes which have been specifically shielded from its influence. This is it.  This is our only safe harbor. This room represents the length and breadth of the war.\"</p>",
