I was thinking some more on your question:</p>\n<p>So for my research, I have been working in the domain of observational health research which uses as a data source, retrospective data like patient medical claims, electronic health records, etc. A couple significant components to this research has been 1) Structuring this data in a meaningful and standardized way 2) Developing definitions of disease using a variety of medical ontologies  and 3) Extracting patient cohorts from this data based on 1 and 2 to draw potential conclusions in the context of retrospective studies. 1 has been somewhat solved in my space thanks to a format known as the OMOP Common Data Model which has been adopted internationally for working with this sort of data. 2 and 3 are very much an open questions that I am exploring and working on.</p>",

Some things that I have been openly exploring within intersecting observational health research and category theory are as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Describing disease definitions using pullbacks into different medical ontologies to reconstruct disease definitions across different studies</li>\n<li>Exploring the use of ontology logs to describe patients matching to a specific disease definition (began to more rigorously explore this thought here: <a href=\"#narrow/stream/229199-learning.3A-questions/topic/on.20the.20concept.20of.20ologs/near/287968145\">https://categorytheory.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/229199-learning.3A-questions/topic/on.20the.20concept.20of.20ologs/near/287968145</a>) </li>\n<li>Thinking around CatLab with how I could use a combination of ACSets and Directed Wiring Diagrams to represent my study and chain my work together with other collaborators I work with</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I apologize if the above sounds entirely inane or puerile but I can't help but feel there is something here when approached from a category theory sense. For me, disease definitions boil down in some cases to sets and family of sets that work very well within the category of <strong>Set</strong>, there feels to be a relationship I can develop between disease definitions and the medical ontologies that were used, and I would love to someday have the ability to treat a given observational study as almost \"filters\" (in a signal processing sense) to create novel studies on patients (e.g. say a study A exists that characterizes depression across age group and race and a study B that characterizes sexual minorities, it would be so cool to compose A and B together to create a study C that characterizes depression across sexual minorities' age group and race).</p>",

This week, I gave an invited talk in NYC at the City University of New York Graduate Center on the culmination of my recent maths research endeavors on the emerging applied research field of compositional public health. This field is extremely early and I am actively involved with defining the vision of this space as well as developing it.Â Here is the talk abstract:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Compositional public health is an emerging research field that exists to address the complexity in public health responses. The field lies at the intersection of category theory, epidemiology, and engineering and utilizes tools from applied category theory for public health applications. This talk will present the motivation of this field, an overview of the mathematics involved in its approaches, current state of the art, live demonstrations, and future research directions within this developing field.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here is the link to the talk recording:Â <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60GHdzetEqI\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60GHdzetEqI</a><br>\nHere is the link to the slides: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zL19aMAKUjsvKa7-sDGWUAH1U0dTW0dnPL4A6bEYxP8/edit?usp=sharing\">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zL19aMAKUjsvKa7-sDGWUAH1U0dTW0dnPL4A6bEYxP8/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>\n<div class=\"youtube-video message_inline_image\"><a data-id=\"60GHdzetEqI\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60GHdzetEqI\"><img src=\"https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/257c9bed05d2ede219cca3a67d2e22567c76317f/68747470733a2f2f692e7974696d672e636f6d2f76692f36304748647a65744571492f64656661756c742e6a7067\"></a></div>",
