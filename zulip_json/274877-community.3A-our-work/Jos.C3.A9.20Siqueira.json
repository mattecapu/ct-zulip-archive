        "content": "<p>I thought it'd be a good idea to tell you what I've been up to as well!</p>\n<p>I submitted a couple of papers last year, in collaboration with <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"386922\">@Graham Manuell</span>  and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"386925\">@Peter Faul</span> :</p>\n<p>1) In <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07926\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07926</a>  we prove an extension of a classical theorem on collations of families of functors into a bifunctor, which turns out to also generalize the process of composing monads via a distributive law. This provides a notion of  \"distributive law\" for lax functors.</p>\n<p>2) In <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04963\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04963</a>,  we show that Artin glueings of toposes correspond to a 2-categorical notion of adjoint split extensions in the 2-category of toposes,  cartesian functors, and natural transformations. This is another instance of a statement for frames/locales carrying over to the topos level, although the process wasn't easy.</p>\n<p>I've also just submitted my PhD thesis, which doesn't really have to do with those papers; it is a new attempt to categorify nonstandard analysis, going through the route of Internal Set Theory and using Tripos Theory as the main tool. The idea is to show that if you start with a model of ZFC (with the language including a st(x) symbol), then the satisfaction of the additional axioms of IST that make nonstandard proofs work (Idealization, Standardization, and Transfer) correspond to certain relationships holding between 3  triposes you can build. This then<br>\nsuggests a notion of \"tripos model of IST\" which abstracts away what is necessary to make the machinery work, so that you can replicate the nonstandard proof methods in any such model. We can then describe what Standardization and Idealization (and not just Transfer) mean in contexts such as the one studied by A. Kock and C. J. Mikkelsen in their old paper on nonstandard extensions, for example.</p>\n<p>Now that it is submitted, I'll probably  think about how to structure some of the material (plus some extra stuff) into paper form and look for postdocs and collaborations. Please do get in touch if you think you can help with that :)</p>",

This suggests a rather weird generalisation to some kind of 2-category of maps between 2-categories that don't need to preserve the 1-dimensional structure, but I haven't had time to think exactly how this would work.</p>",

I don't input Unicode mathematical symbols directly, but I do use Unicode mathematical fonts (specifically, STIX-Math) in the output, instead of traditional TeX fonts. I don't know what the situation is now, but 6 years ago when I was writing my thesis STIX-Math had excellent coverage of symbols in a single font, which helped visual consistency. Times Roman is not my favourite typeface but STIX-Math was compelling enough that I typeset the running text in Times Roman for consistency.</p>",

I went through the \"contact us\" link to get to technical support, and they immediately granted an exception to allow us to submit a pdf on its own. It's perhaps not ideal but I think it's much better than sweating over it for days or putting it off. (I think my recent issue was that we had used xetex or luatex for some reason... I understand John's point but I also understand why some people want to experiment with different/better typesetting tools.)</p>",
