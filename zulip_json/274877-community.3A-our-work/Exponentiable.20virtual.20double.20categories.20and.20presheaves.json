We explore some consequences of this characterisation, demonstrating that it facilitates simple proofs of statements that heretofore required unwieldy computations. For instance, we deduce that the 2-category of pseudo double categories and lax functors is enriched in the 2-category of normal virtual double categories, and demonstrate that several aspects of the Yoneda theory of pseudo double categories – such as the correspondence between presheaves and discrete fibrations – are substantially simplified by this perspective.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The motivation for this paper is to understand the nature of the presheaf construction and the Yoneda lemma in double category theory. These were originally studied by Bob Paré in <a href=\"http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/25/17/25-17abs.html\">Yoneda theory for double categories</a>. However, some surprises arise when one studies presheaves in this context: for instance, while presheaves on a category form a category, presheaves on a double category form not a double category but a <a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/virtual%20double%20category\">[[virtual double category]]</a>. This paper arose out of my trying to understand why this is.</p>\n<p>In the paper, I explain that Paré's virtual double category of presheaves arises from two natural constructions on virtual double categories: taking exponentials, and the construction of monads and bimodules in a virtual double category (the so-called <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant=\"double-struck\">M</mi><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">o</mi><mi mathvariant=\"bold\">d</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mathbf{\\mathbb Mod}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6944em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathbb\">M</span><span class=\"mord mathbf\">od</span></span></span></span></span> construction). This perspective is inspired by work of <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"345091\">@Claudio Pisani</span> on exponentiable multicategories. As a result, calculations involving presheaves on double categories are substantially simplified: for instance, I use it to give a new proof of the correspondence between presheaves on double categories and discrete fibrations of double categories. Along the way, I develop some (virtual) double category theory that I believe is of independent interest, so I'd encourage anyone interested in these topics to take a look, even if you're not specifically interested in the theory of presheaves.</p>\n<p>As always, I'd be very happy to answer any questions anyone has!</p>",

        "content": "<p>I really enjoyed reading through this paper, since the matter of defining virtual double categories of lax functors between virtual double categories was something I have thought about a lot. I found it quite surprising that not every VDC was an exponentiable object in the 2-category of VDCs, since there is a usual category of lax functors between VDCs (giving us vertical arrows) and generally there's no restrictions on what the horizontal arrows can be (since they don't need to compose). <br>\nMaybe the issue is that there's \"too much\" freedom in how one could choose the horizontal arrows in a functor VDC (IE, the \"existence\" property is always satisfied, but not the \"uniqueness\" to make it a full exponential object). But I might be mistaken about this. Will certainly have more questions on this though, I just have to formulate them properly!</p>",

The difference from ordinary functors is that even a terminal functor can have factorizations of cells that don't lift, because the terminal VDC is a lot less trivial than the terminal category.</p>\n<p>An example of a normal VDC that isn't exponentiable--either as a normal VDC or a plain one--is the one generated by a single 3-ary 2-cell in general position.  The two factorizations of the 3-ary 2-cell as two 2-ary 2-cells (and an identity) in the terminal VDC don't lift in the case of the generating cell, which means products with this VDC don't preserve pushouts.  (This example is a slight modification of one due to Kevin Carlson, who in turn was inspired by one of Pisani's examples for multicategories.)</p>",

One of the main reasons for my interest in higher dimensional category theory is in how it relates to formal category theory. From what I've seen, there's two ways of doing formal category theory- equipments (like virtual equipments) that add a notion of \"profunctor\", and structures (like Yoneda structures) that add a notion of \"presheaf object\". The above work seems to be in the latter domain (ironically while working with the structures we use in the former). A <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01594\">previous work</a> shows how these relate in simple cases. For instance, a Yoneda structure is given as a relative lax idempotent 2-monad, and the corresponding proarrow equipment that gives the same formal category theory uses the Kleisli construction for this relative monad.</p>",

I don't know of any examples of augmented virtual equipments that are not virtual equipments that I think are interesting examples. The only example Koudenburg gives is starting with a virtual equipment and then taking a sub-augmented virtual equipment of it (e.g. large categories and small distributors). While this is useful for making a formal connection to Yoneda structures (which is useful for historical context), I'm not convinced this is an interesting example; it seems artificial to limit the size of objects and loose morphisms differently.</p>",
