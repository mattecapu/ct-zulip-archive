Yet, I consider this as a very hard project. Categorical logic is many things, and more importantly it is a collection of point of views (type theory, universal algebra, functorial semantics, axiomatizations of categories of structures), it is also \"many communities\" to pay tribute to (<a href=\"https://diliberti.github.io/Read/Read.html#cl\">https://diliberti.github.io/Read/Read.html#cl</a>)... my honest opinion is that in a way, we need more a Handbook of Categorical Logic then a book whose title is \"Categorical Logic\".

PVS's <code>grind</code> is perhaps the worst offender!</p>\n<p>Even though I have published a lot of papers on meta-programming, somehow the MTAC language as a means to give instructions on how to build my proofs doesn't really resonate with me. I agree 100% that Agda hides that part, because that is mostly done in an invisible way in the IDE (the equivalent of 'intro' and 'intros' and 'case split' and ... all exist in Agda too, but they are IDE \"gestures\" rather that residuated in the proof).</p>\n<p>As it turns out, for the kinds of results that I'm interested in, the explicit proof terms are very important to me. So I like seeing them, Agda/Idris style.   Whether it's PL meta-theory or category theory in a constructive setting, I like to be forced to do explicit equational proofs. One huge advantage: when doing n-category theory, one can immediately see what will be hard work in (n+1)-category theory. This is also a huge disadvantage if you have no intention of going there!

The idea is that if you write just <code>f ? a</code>, then <code>?</code> is a hole that's reported to the user with its context and type.  But when you \"fill\" it with a term like <code>g a b</code>, instead of that term replacing the hole to get <code>f (g a b) a</code>, it comes after it delimited by a semicolon (or something): <code>f ? a ; g a b</code>.  Semantically this means the stame as <code>f (g a b) a</code>, so the semicolon is sort of a backwards let-binding akin to <code>let ? = g a b in f ? a</code>.  The difference is that the type of <code>?</code> is still inferred from its use point in <code>f ? a</code>, with the term <code>g a b</code> being checked against that type.  Multiple holes can also be chained, with the same term being obtainable as <code>f ? a ; g ? b ; a</code> or <code>f ? ? ; g a b ; a</code>; the question-marks \"go onto a queue\" as they are encountered and semicolons fill them in order.</p>",

So here's mine:</p>\n<p><strong>Title:</strong> Lifting Grothendieck universes to Grothendieck toposes</p>\n<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A Grothendieck topos is a category that behaves much like the category of sets, and in particular interprets constructive type theory.  A Grothendieck universe is a set of sets giving rise to a small category that behaves much like the large category of all sets.  It is thus natural to ask, if Grothendieck universes exist in sets, do Grothendieck toposes also contain analogous \"universes\"?  This was shown for presheaf toposes by Hofmann and Streicher in 1997, and for all Grothendieck toposes by Streicher in 2005.  However, Streicher's sheaf universes lack a \"realignment\" property that is needed for some applications, including the interpretation of cumulative universes in type theory.  We will use a form of Quillen's small object argument, plus descent, to construct universes satisfying realignment in all Grothendieck toposes.  This is joint work with Gratzer and Sterling.</p>\n<p>(The paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12012\">Strict universes for Grothendieck topoi</a>.)</p>",

This state of affairs seems to be due to the impracticality of formalizing typical science in standard logic and to the lack of obvious benefit that would ensue to scientists by doing so. In this talk, I will argue that there is a significant opportunity to encourage greater use of formal logic in science by adopting modern techniques from categorical logic, the approach to logic based on category theory. I will explain how specific features of categorical logic, such as the ability to assemble \"domain-specific\" logics, the algebraization of syntax, morphisms between theories, flexible notions of theory equivalence, and the functorial view of semantics, all help to overcome philosophical and practical obstacles to formalization in science and suggest ways to create new capabilities for scientists. Finally, I will briefly describe ongoing efforts to realize these ideas as software for scientific modeling. Throughout, I take the perspective that philosophy of science should not be merely descriptive of current or past scientific practice, but has an important prescriptive role to play in shaping scientific methodology in the long term.</p>\n</blockquote>",

This state of affairs seems to be due to the impracticality of formalizing typical science in standard logic and to the lack of obvious benefit that would ensue to scientists by doing so. In this talk, I will argue that there is a significant opportunity to encourage greater use of formal logic in science by adopting modern techniques from categorical logic, the approach to logic based on category theory. I will explain how specific features of categorical logic, such as the ability to assemble \"domain-specific\" logics, the algebraization of syntax, morphisms between theories, flexible notions of theory equivalence, and the functorial view of semantics, all help to overcome philosophical and practical obstacles to formalization in science and suggest ways to create new capabilities for scientists. Finally, I will briefly describe ongoing efforts to realize these ideas as software for scientific modeling. Throughout, I take the perspective that philosophy of science should not be merely descriptive of current or past scientific practice, but has an important prescriptive role to play in shaping scientific methodology in the long term.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is really interesting! Would love to chat more about this some time, very much related to some issues I've spent some time thinking thinking about</p>",

So far, it implements an internal parametricity theory that's intended to serve as a non-univalent substrate for defining HOTT later (hopefully not too much later!), but it can also be used directly right now for several versions of parametricity.</p>\n<p>There aren't a lot of ergonomic features (e.g. no unification, implicit arguments, or interactivity), and it's technically inconsistent (e.g. type-in-type and no termination, positivity, or productivity checking) but it's fairly usable.  The GitHub README describes the syntax and capabilities in a fair amount of detail, and last weekend I gave a <a href=\"http://home.sandiego.edu/~shulman/papers/running-hott.pdf\">talk</a> at the \"Running HoTT\" conference sketching the normalization algorithm that it's based on.</p>",

category (particularly if we include amnesty).  But I'm thinking it might be easier to conceptualize as a direct abstraction of examples like groups, rings, vector spaces, and so on, by leaving out the extra hurdle of having to think of a \"morphism\" as an undefined abstract object rather than just as a \"structure-preserving function\", and getting properties like associativity for free from familiar composition of set-functions.</p>\n<p>I don't think I've seen a direct definition of \"concrete category\" like this that doesn't go through the definition of an abstract category (except I have a vague memory of something like it somewhere in Bourbaki).  Probably we all agree nowadays that in principle it's better to define abstract categories first and then concrete categories as abstract ones with a special kind of functor to Set, but I wonder whether anyone has considered the possible pedagogical value of starting with concrete ones only?  Or can you think of reasons why it's a bad idea?</p>",

One of the things I've only gradually come to appreciate in my years of teaching is that I'm atypical, at least compared to my students, in terms of what's intuitive to me and how I like to think about things.  I am reminded of John Baez's quip that category theorists dual to ordinary people, getting more confused when you surround an abstract concept with lots of distracting specifics.  The flip side of that is that we category theorists can recognize that many ordinary people are dual to us, getting more confused the more abstract a definition is.</p>\n<p>Last summer I had some undergraduate research students who started out by learning some category theory, and I found one of the hurdles for them to get over was the idea that a \"morphism\" can be anything at all.  Of course this is an important hurdle to get over eventually, but I would rather not spend the time getting over it in this class if I don't have to, and all the categories I plan to use in this class are concrete.</p>\n<p>Does that help explain the benefit I hope to get?</p>",

Like, what does this buy you that you couldn't get by giving the usual definition of a category, only giving concrete algebraic examples, and making a passing remark that \"not every category looks like this, but we won't encounter other kinds of category in this class\"? You could say that \"categories in which every object has an underlying set are called 'concrete', and in this class we'll only talk about concrete categories\". Then students know there's a broader world, see the usual definition, and still don't have to grapple with categories as combinatorial/geometric/etc. objects</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I would like to second this; for the few that encounter categories later on, having to unlearn this specific understanding of what a category is will be much simpler if they know in advance that there is more to the story.<br>\nMore importantly, a majority of students will look up some of the stuff you teach them at some point, and not knowing that there is a bigger story (or at least that the way you are presenting things is atypical) will make the way things are presented on the nLab or Wikipedia much more confusing.</p>",

By far the most common beginner question on category theory math stack exchange is something about “but how does a morphism in the opposite category act on elements of the domain?” Compared to that guaranteed struggle, I have trouble feeling very worried about Morgan’s concerns; students are unlikely to meet more category theory until graduate level courses, when we can assume they’re prepared to think hard, and at the undergrad level math Wikipedia and all the more so the nLab are very hard to use no matter what.</p>",

But it turns out that in order to prove basically anything useful about \"subobjects\" in a concrete category, you have to assume a stronger property that if <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>:</mo><mi>A</mi><mo>→</mo><mi>X</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">f:A\\to X</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8889em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.10764em;\">f</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">:</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">A</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">→</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.6833em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.07847em;\">X</span></span></span></span> is any morphism that factors through the subobject as a function, the factorization is also a morphism.  (I sort of came to this conclusion on my own, and then reading Adamek's book confirmed it.)  This is complicated enough that I didn't want to get into it; one might argue it's even <em>more</em> complicated than the notion of monomorphism.  So in the end, I didn't talk about subobjects abstractly at all.  I did talk about <em>kernels</em> abstractly, with the appropriate universal property in any category with zero morphisms, because I then wanted to dualize it in order to introduce cokernels and quotient objects.  But I just remarked that in all the categories we're interested in, a kernel can be constructed as the <em>subset</em> of elements that map to zero, without trying to be more general.</p>",

If the basic syntax of a monad's \"bind\" operation <code>M a -&gt; (a -&gt; M b) -&gt; M b</code> is written (as in usually is in OCaml) with a let-binding:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"OCaml\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">let</span><span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">mx</span> <span class=\"k\">in</span>\n<span class=\"n\">my</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>where <code>mx : M a</code> and <code>fun x -&gt; my : a -&gt; M b</code>, then the basic operation of an applicative functor can be written (and usually is in OCaml) as</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"OCaml\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">let</span><span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">mx</span>\n<span class=\"k\">and</span><span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">y</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">my</span>\n<span class=\"k\">and</span><span class=\"o\">+</span> <span class=\"n\">z</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">mz</span> <span class=\"k\">in</span>\n<span class=\"n\">w</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>where <code>x : F a</code>, <code>y : F b</code>, <code>z  : F c</code>, and <code>fun x y z -&gt; w : a -&gt; b -&gt; c -&gt; d</code>.  This looks similar to the iterated monadic syntax</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"OCaml\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">let</span><span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">mx</span> <span class=\"k\">in</span>\n<span class=\"k\">let</span><span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"n\">y</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">my</span> <span class=\"k\">in</span>\n<span class=\"k\">let</span><span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"n\">z</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">mz</span> <span class=\"k\">in</span>\n<span class=\"n\">return</span> <span class=\"n\">w</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>with the differences being that (1) in the monadic syntax, each monadic value such as<code>my</code> can depend on the previously bound variables such as <code>x</code>, whereas in the applicative case none of the applicative values in a <code>let+/and+</code> can depend on other variables bound in it, and (2) in the monadic case the body (such as <code>return w</code>) is also monadic, whereas in the applicative case it is not.</p>\n<p>And indeed, one can prove mathematically that any strong monad is a lax monoidal functor.</p>",

Then in order to use it with monads as I was before, I could just make all my monads into applicative functors and use the applicative version.</p>\n<p>But it turns out this is wrong, at least in a language like OCaml that also has non-monadic (and non-applicative) effects.</p>",
