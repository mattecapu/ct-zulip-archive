How do we define a 'quantitative' version of monoidal theories, where we can have axioms of the form 'string diagram 1 is at distance at most epsilon from string diagram 2'? What it means for such a theory to be a presentation of an (enriched) category? It turns out even just defining all that requires quite a bit of machinery, which is what we develop in this work.</p>",
