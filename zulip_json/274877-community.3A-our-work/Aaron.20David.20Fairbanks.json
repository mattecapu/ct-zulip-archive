        "content": "<p>A new paper, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14993\">On Traces in Categories of Contractions</a> by Peter Selinger and me appeared on the arXiv today! This version is twelve pages long, with some extra stuff in appendices. We plan to write a longer version later.</p>\n<p>Here is the abstract:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Traced monoidal categories are used to model processes that can feed their outputs back to their own inputs, abstracting iteration. The category of finite dimensional Hilbert spaces with the direct sum tensor is not traced. But surprisingly, in 2014, Bartha showed that the monoidal subcategory of isometries is traced. The same holds for coisometries, unitary maps, and contractions. This suggests the possibility of feeding outputs of quantum processes back to their own inputs, analogous to iteration. In this paper, we show that Bartha's result is not specifically tied to Hilbert spaces, but works in any dagger additive category with Moore-Penrose pseudoinverses (a natural dagger-categorical generalization of inverses).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Moore-Penrose pseudoinverses are really interesting. They can be defined in any dagger category, and just like the definition of inverse, the definition of pseudoinverse is purely equational. When the pseudoinverse of an arrow exists, it is unique. They also arise very naturally in relation to idempotents -- an arrow <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">f</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8889em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.10764em;\">f</span></span></span></span> is pseudoinvertible if and only if it constitutes some isomorphism of dagger-idempotents <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mspace></mspace><mspace width=\"0.1111em\"/><mo lspace=\"0em\" rspace=\"0.17em\"></mo><mtext> ⁣</mtext><mo lspace=\"0em\" rspace=\"0em\">:</mo><mspace width=\"0.3333em\"/><mi>p</mi><mo>→</mo><mi>q</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">f \\colon p \\to q</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8889em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.10764em;\">f</span><span class=\"mspace nobreak\"></span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.1111em;\"></span><span class=\"mpunct\"></span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:-0.1667em;\"></span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.1667em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mrel\">:</span></span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.3333em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">p</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span><span class=\"mrel\">→</span><span class=\"mspace\" style=\"margin-right:0.2778em;\"></span></span><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.03588em;\">q</span></span></span></span> (where <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">p</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">p</span></span></span></span> is basically projection onto the coimage of <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">f</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8889em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.10764em;\">f</span></span></span></span> and <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>q</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">q</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.03588em;\">q</span></span></span></span> is projection onto the image of <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">f</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8889em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.10764em;\">f</span></span></span></span>).

        "content": "<p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23651\">Doubly weak double categories</a> by me and <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"276777\">@Mike Shulman</span> has appeared on the arXiv!</p>\n<p>Here is the abstract:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We propose a definition of double categories whose composition of 1-cells is weak in both directions. Namely, a doubly weak double category is a  double computad -- a structure with 2-cells of all possible  double-categorical shapes -- equipped with all possible composition  operations, coherently. We also characterize them using \"implicit\"  double categories, which are double computads having all possible compositions of 2-cells, but no compositions of 1-cells; doubly weak double categories are then obtained by a simple representability criterion. Finally, they can also be defined by adding a \"tidiness\" condition to the double bicategories of Verity, or to the cubical bicategories of Garner.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This collaboration started <a href=\"#narrow/channel/229199-learning.3A-questions/topic/representable.20props.20and.20pros/with/301511384\">almost three years ago on this Zulip</a>. It's the most ambitious project I have completed to date.</p>\n<p>The results of the paper also include as a special case the \"folklore\" result that monoidal categories are equivalent to representable colored PROs. Some people <a href=\"#narrow/channel/232160-learning.3A-reading-.26-references/topic/String.20diagrams/with/404648516\">here</a> were interested in this, because it means non-strict monoidal categories are described directly by string diagrams. Just for the sake of it, here's a recap of that story:</p>\n<p>A multicategory (a.k.a. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/0907.2460\">virtual</a> monoidal category) is a structure like a category but where each arrow has a <em>list</em> of input objects and one output object. A colored PRO (a.k.a., in the terminology of our paper, <em>implicit</em> monoidal category) is a structure like a category but where each arrow has a list of input objects and a list of output objects. It's the essentially algebraic structure that natively describes computations with string diagrams for monoidal categories.</p>\n<p>A multicategory is called representable when all \"tensor products\" of lists of objects exist -- a tensor product being an object satisfying an appropriate <a href=\"https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/representable+multicategory\">universal property</a>. It's well-known that monoidal categories may be equivalently described by representable multicategories, which is a definition of monoidal category that alleviates the need to deal with any coherence data. Moreover, a <em>lax</em> monoidal functor between monoidal categories is the same thing as a map between their underlying representable multicategories. (Multicategories are an essentially algebraic structure, and what is meant by a \"map of multicategories\" is a homomorphism of that structure.)</p>\n<p>A colored PRO is likewise called representable when all \"tensor products\" of lists of objects exist. In this case tensor products are easier to define: a tensor product of a list of objects is simply an isomorphism to a single object. It's less well-known than the case of multicategories, but just as useful, that monoidal categories may be equivalently defined as representable colored PROs. A <em>strong</em> monoidal functor between monoidal categories is then the same thing as a map between the underlying representable colored PROs. (Colored PROs are an essentially algebraic structure, and what is meant by a \"map of colored PROs\" is a homomorphism of that structure.)</p>\n<p>This generalizes from monoidal categories to bicategories.

However, there is a slight discrepancy: weak double bicategories give rise to a tidy/saturated Verity double bicategory, which is not the case for pseudo double categories. Let's say that pseudo double categories are strict in the vertical direction and weak in the horizontal direction. In this embedding, the vertical bigons/cells are taken to be identities of vertical morphisms, and those are not necessarily the same as squares. It is necessary to define the map this way, because otherwise univalence would not be preserved. In a univalent pseudo double category, we require the vertical category and the category of horizontal morphisms and squares to be univalent, but this is not sufficient to guarantee that the category of vertical morphisms and squares is univalent as well. For this reason, the notion of weak double category does not encompass the notion of pseudo double category, as pseudo double categories are only saturated/tidy in one direction. The notion of Verity double bicategory does give the desired framework, since we need the flexibility of having bigons/cells to encapsulate pseudo double categories as well. In our view, Verity double bicategories act as 'pre double categories'.</p>\n<p>We can view this construction from the perspective of classical mathematics as well. There one can show that every pseudo double category gives rise to a weak double category in the obvious way. However, this construction does not interact well with equivalence. Specifically, vertical equivalence of pseudo double categories do not correspond to gregarious equivalence of their associated weak double category. Vertical morphisms are viewed up to equality in a horizontal equivalence, whereas they are viewed up to invertible squares in a gregarious equivalence. This construction would thus not be fully faithful in a suitable sense. If instead we map pseudo double categories to Verity double bicategories that are not fully saturated, then we obtain a construction that does interact well with vertical equivalences for <a href=\"https://msp.org/agt/2023/23-4/p08.xhtml\">weakly vertically invariant</a> pseudo double categories (the cited paper uses horizontal invariance due to weakness being in the other direction).</p>",

I've heard of this book called \"nonabelian algebraic topology\" which argues for using more cubical methods, including this double groupoid - apparently you get nonabelian analogs of the higher homotopy groups...?</p>\n<p>Anyway I guess the only reason I'm more interested in \"geometric\" (or i guess \"algebro-geometric\") approaches myself is that they seem to be cleaner with regards to coherence conditions - e.g. for quasicategories, you don't need to explicitly supply any coherence isos or associators, they \"come for free\" in a sense.</p>\n<p>I wonder how hard it'd be to generalise your work to 3-groupoids?

The main thing I was worried about is that every implicit double category in your sense has a \"strictification\" given by its path category, so would a notion of \"triply weak triple category\" also have a strictification?</p>",
