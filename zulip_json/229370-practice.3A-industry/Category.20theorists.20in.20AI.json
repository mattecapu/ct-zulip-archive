        "content": "<p>Here's a draft of a blog article I want to write.   What are the main other organizations using category theory for AI?</p>\n<h2>Category Theorists in AI</h2>\n<p>I avoid working on AI and machine learning, both because it's a hot topic, with all the usual problems that brings, and because these tools are mainly being used to make rich and powerful people richer and more powerful---with all the usual problems <em>that</em> brings.</p>\n<p>However, I like to pay attention to how category theorists are getting jobs in the AI industry, and what they're doing---in part because I know and like many of these people, and in part because I wonder what they will do for AI, and what work on AI will do to them.</p>\n<p>Here are some stories I've been following intermittently:</p>\n<h3>Symbolica</h3>\n<p>When Musk and his AI head <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrej_Karpathy\">Andrej Karpathy</a> didn't listen to their engineer <a href=\"https://blog.infinity.ai/ep-3-our-approach-to-ai-is-broken-george-morgan-3053cb18c7f7\">George Morgan's</a> worry that current techniques in deep learning couldn't \"scale to infinity and solve all problems,\" Morgan left Tesla and started a company called <a href=\"https://www.symbolica.ai/\">Symbolica</a> to work on symbolic reasoning.   The billionaire <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinod_Khosla\">Vinod Khosla</a> gave him $2 million in seed money.  He began with an approach based on hypergraphs, but then these researchers wrote a position paper that pushed the company in a different direction:</p>\n<p>&bull; <a href=\"https://www.brunogavranovic.com/\">Bruno Gavranović</a>, <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/paul-roy-lessard/home?authuser=0\">Paul Lessard</a>, <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DdFjaEEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">Andrew Dudzik</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/tamara-von-glehn-66a703175/?originalSubdomain=uk\">Tamara von Glehn</a>, <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WL9vouMAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">João G. M. Araújo</a> and <a href=\"https://petar-v.com/\">Petar Veličković</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15332\">Position: Categorical Deep Learning is an Algebraic Theory of All Architectures</a></p>\n<p>Kholsa liked the new direction and invested $30 million more in Symbolica.  At Gavranovic and Lessard's suggestion Morgan hired category theorists including <a href=\"https://dom-verity.github.io/pages/CV.html\">Dominic Verity</a> and <a href=\"https://www.strath.ac.uk/staff/ghanineilprof/\">Neil Ghani</a>.</p>\n<p>But Morgan was never fully sold on category theory: he still wanted to pursue his hypergraph approach. Aafter a while, continued disagreements between Morgan and the category theorists took its toll.   He fired some, even having one summarily removed from his office.  Another resigned voluntarily.  Due to nondisclosure agreements, these people no longer talk publicly about what went down.</p>\n<p>So one moral for category theorists, or indeed anyone with a good idea: after your idea helps someone get a lot of money, they may be able to fire you.</p>\n<h3>Topos UK</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidad/?originalSubdomain=uk\">David Dalrymple</a> is running a program on \"safeguarded AI\" at the UK agency ARIA (the Advanced Research + Invention agency) and he is very interested in using category theory for this purpose.  </p>\n<p>This program is funding a new branch of the Topos Institute at Oxford, called Topos UK.  The previous Topos Institute is a math research institute in Berkeley with a focus on category theory.  Three young category theorists there---<a href=\"https://slibkind.github.io/\">Sophie Libkind</a>, <a href=\"http://davidjaz.com/\">David Jaz Myers</a> and <a href=\"https://owenlynch.org/\">Owen Lynch</a>---wrote a proposal called \"Double categorical systems theory for safeguarded AI\", which got funded by ARIA.  </p>\n<p>It looks like David Jaz Myers, Owen Lynch, <a href=\"https://thosgood.com/\">Tim Hosgood</a>, <a href=\"https://jsiqueira.owlstown.net\">José Siquiera</a> and <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=55dzbRgAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">Xiaoyan Li</a> will be working at Topos UK.</p>\n<h3>Glaive</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://glaive-research.org/\">Glasgow Lab for AI Verification</a> or 'Glaive' is a non-profit limited company focusing on applying category theory to AI verification.  The people working for it include <a href=\"https://dylanbraithwaite.github.io/\">Dylan Braithwaite</a>, <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/jadeedenstarmaster/home\">Jade Master</a>, <a href=\"https://zanzix.github.io/\">Zans Mihejevs</a>, <a href=\"https://andrevidela.com/\">André Videla</a>, <a href=\"https://glaive-research.org/Resources/CV-41.pdf\">Neil Ghani</a> and <a href=\"https://julesh.com/\">Jules Hedges</a>.</p>\n<p>Like the Topos UK, Glaive is supported by ARIA.  I don't know enough about what they're doing.</p>",

Matteo’s goal is to study the link between the compositional and morphological structure of systems and their behaviour, specifically in the way logic pertaining these two components works, accounting for both dynamic and temporal features.

These Nets will model dynamical systems that undergo mode or phase transitions, altering their possible places, events, and interactions. Their goal is to create a category-theoretic framework for mathematical modelling and safe-by-design specification of dynamical systems and process theories which exhibit multiple modes of operation.</p>",
