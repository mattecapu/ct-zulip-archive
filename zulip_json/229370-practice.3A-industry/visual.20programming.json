For old systems, the pipes could be really screwed up, leaking a bunch, letting in groundwater etc. (like most oldish cities in the US), but for the most part water comes out when you turn the faucet on... so who cares. For critical systems, it might be time for an upgrade. </p>\n<p>When you want to build or design something, you typically don't start designing new pipes. The pipes are already out there, you just might need someone more knowledgeable about plumbing to figure out which pipes to use where. I guess here the existing pipes are existing gizmos in CT and really wherever. Also, just because the two ends of a pipe type-check with a missing piece of your system, it doesn't mean you should just shove that pipe in there.</p>",
