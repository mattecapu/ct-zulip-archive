<p>hello, I'm Christian. I'm studying with John Baez and the team at UC Riverside. I love category theory, and lots of things. currently I'm working for a distributed computing platform called RChain - it's based on a concurrent language, and we're using categories to give it a good type system.</p>

I also have some data analysis experience and now I'm learning TDA. I think that cool visualization can bring together different specialists to work on a common problem, as we see now with pandemic. TDA is also very interesting because it can help avoid research bias.

<p>Yoo, I'm Stelios, currently a CS PhD student in Belgium. Before that I was doing some shady computer security stuff. Right now I'm working on extending "mathematical operational semantics", a certain category-theoretic representation of PL. I find it amusing that this kind of work is foundational in PL theory yet applied in CT :P.</p>

<p>I think it's really great that we're starting this.  Starting on Wednesday April 1st our group, <strong>ACT@UCR</strong>, will begin a series of online seminars  at 10am Pacific time = 1pm East Coast time = 5pm (UTC+0).   We hope all of you attend!  We hope to have discussions afterward here!  </p>

<p>I've not much time to give a reply tonight. I don't think Noncommutative Topos is an aporia and there was an attempt to define it last year. For Kristeva and the semiotic, in reply to @janet singer, one needs a womans body='place' or topos, which is minor in Deleuzes sense and radical or noncommutative, and whose internal logic is the feminine mysticism=Brouwerism. Another use might be in Topos Quantum Theory which is too bound to Kochen-Specker and the classical observation states. One might want something with stronger entanglement, using tensor products on Quantales. I'd like to have a Many World variant of (non)commutative Topos Quantum Theory. I'm not sure if you are doubtful of the use of a putative noncommutative Topos or you think its proper development could be valid only being more subtle than what I have in mind?</p>

<p>Hi! I've been a software developer for several decades (a bit of everything), but my education was in EE (signal processing).<br>
I still do electronics as a hobby, and amateur radio (WA2HEE).</p>
<p>I'm slowly working through Seven Sketches with a study group at work.<br>
As I currently work at a data science company, I'm interested in functorial data migration, and the math behind linked data (RDF and such).<br>
I thought Lisp had prepared me for functional programming, but Haskell showed me I have a lot to learn about CS math, not just CT.</p>
<p>As a learning exercise I'm trying to model software-defined radio flowgraphs.  There's monoidal categories in there somewhere.</p>

<p>Hi everyone! I’m a software developer with JPL; I work on multi-mission ground software at my day job, but in my spare time I like to study algebra, category theory, and logic programming languages. I’m particularly interested recently in applying the categorical mindset to reasoning about software architecture, as opposed to types or algorithms.</p>
<p>Right now I’m just working through Aluffi’s Algebra to warm up with a more familiar (undergraduate!) setting 😅</p>

<p>Hello, I'm Ben! I'm an undergraduate student in computer science with a very strong interest in Programming Language Theory and Category Theory. My current interest is in using CT to help in the software design process. Most papers I've found so far are above my level, so I'm going to catch up on a lot of reading once I'm finished with this last semester of school. I'm planning to start with Seven Sketches, if anyone would like to join me.</p>

<p>Hi! I'm François-René "Faré" Rideau, @ngnghm on twitter for computing stuff. I made trivial use of Category Theory in my unpublished PhD thesis to unify various computational paradigms and formalize the notion of Implementation of one with the other as (opposite of) profunctors, with natural transformations being opposites of code instrumentation / ornaments. At work, I am using both Game Theory and Game Semantics to model and implement applications that use blockchain smart contracts to keep the interests of participants aligned. And I'm hoping to also use Category Theory there. Yet I'm still a beginner who still doesn't fully grok the Yoneda Lemma.</p>

<p>My implementations are actually spans of a full embedding and a regular functor, plus many optional diagrammatic properties. I suppose I could relax the "full embedding" part to fit existing theories, but am not sure how to deal with the extra complexity then.</p>

<p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>I'm Scott Morrison, a mathematician interested in "low dimensional category theory", particularly with connections to topological phases of matter and quantum topology. I love 2- and 3- and even higher categories, but I mostly think about them from a very geometric point of view. If pressed, I will try to argue that (my corner of) higher category theory is more about manifolds, stratifications, cell-complexes, and geometric structures than it is about algebra or homotopy theory.</p>
<p>Mostly I work in the "fusion categories" or "quantum symmetries" community, where a lot of my work has consisted of connecting the sorts of categories which appear to describe topological phases in condensed matter physics with computational and classification problems.</p>
<p>I'm also one of the active contributors to the category theory library in Lean. mathlib (the mathematics library for Lean) is pretty amazing, growing faster, and rapidly approaching being useful. I'd be very happy to talk to people about this side of things, as well.</p>

I am also quite excited about applied category theory and currently working on revamping OpenRefine's data model with CT in mind. On the side, I work with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275901">@Jules Hedges</span> on bimonoidal categories at the moment. Thanks Jules for choosing Zulip! (it's FOSS, yay!)</p>

<p>Hello everyone, I'm Fab. I lead research at a company called Statebox where we apply CT to pretty much everything one can think of. Before that I did my PhD at Oxford with Bob Coecke about categorical quantum mechanics applied to language. Categorical Quantum Mechanics is very cool, while CQM applied to language is now the thing I hate the most in the whole ACT spectrum.</p>

<p>Hello everyone and thanks to Jules and Christian for setting up this group!<br>
I am a PhD student at the University of Birmingham (UK) with Noam Zeilberger and Paul Levy.  My main areas of research are (linear) logic, (monoidal) category theory  and their applications to (quantum) computer science. For my PhD, I am working on (bi)fibrations of polycategories and their relation to star-autonomous structures. Right now, I am working on a polycategorical Grothendieck construction that involves (the polycategory of) multivariable adjunctions.<br>
In a former life, I was a software engineer using formal methods for developing safety-critical embedded software.</p>

<p>Hello. I'm a PhD student at Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil. I work mostly on mathematical aspects of field theories (specially those involving (higher) categorical language and obstruction theory) and categorification. In my country category theory is not popular. Thus, I have no much people to talk and discuss. I helped to create a research group in my university, but we are always finding for some space (actually we have to fight even for very basic things). Thus, it is amazing for me to have this kind of contact! Thank you for this space. Really, thank you!!</p>

<p>Hello everyone, I'm Jonathan Beardsley. I'm a postdoc at Georgia Tech. I guess I technically do "homotopy theory," but I use a lot of category theory. Thanks to all who set this up. I think public spaces for talking about and learning math are wonderful.</p>

<p>Probably should also say that my attendance here will likely be extremely spotty. We no longer have any childcare and I'm teaching from home and having to reorganize my entire 180 person differential equations class, so haven't had much chance to think about interesting math for a long time.</p>

<p>Hi, this is Serdar Erbatur. My background is on unification theory, which is a subfield of automated reasoning and has connections to logic, algebra, category theory and TCS in general. I have also done a lot of research in PL (type-based program analysis) when I was postdoc in Germany (with Martin Hofmann between 2014 and 2018). I finished my PhD in 2012 and my advisor was Paliath Narendran. I had the privilage of collaborating with great people such Deepak Kapur, Jose Meseguer, Cathy Meadows, Christophe Ringeissen and many others. Currently, I am a teaching faculty at UT Dallas and continue my reseach. Before Dallas, I was a postdoc in three countries: one year in Italy, 3 years in Germany and approx one year in Spain. My research topics are quite theoretical, though I haven't applied anything from category theory myself. I know that a few category theoretic treatments were developed for unification in the past. I would be glad to talk about possible collaboration with anyone who have interest in my topics.</p>

<p>Hi everyone,<br>
I'm Ben MacAdam, I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Calgary. I mostly work on tangent categories, and I'm particularly interested in how classical geometric structures such as Lie algebroids or linear connections can reappear as enriched Lawvere theories or enriched limit theories. I'm also interested in categorical axiomatizations of differential programming languages (which is where all of my actual publications have been so far).</p>

<p>Hi! My name is Eduardo Ochs, and I'm a mathematician working in a small countryside campus in Brazil. My papers, talks and notes are all here - &lt;<a href="http://angg.twu.net/math-b.html" target="_blank" title="http://angg.twu.net/math-b.html">http://angg.twu.net/math-b.html</a>&gt; - and I've been working on something that I call "Categories for Children" (really - look at the URL above for the precise definition!). I'm currently working on 1) an obscure subproject of that that involves representing categorical concepts as diagrams, translating those diagrams to Type Theory, and applying a kind of projection that deletes all components that mention equalities of morphisms, 2) "Hyperdoctrines for children"...</p>
<p>Also, I am the author of this package for drawing diagrams: <a href="http://angg.twu.net/dednat6.html" target="_blank" title="http://angg.twu.net/dednat6.html">http://angg.twu.net/dednat6.html</a></p>

<p>Regarding tangent categorie: as far as I know, these are categories where each object is equipped with structure similar to the tangent bundle of a manifold.  Cruttwell's talk <a href="https://www.mta.ca/uploadedFiles/Community/Bios/Geoff_Cruttwell/ct2014CruttwellTalk.pdf" title="https://www.mta.ca/uploadedFiles/Community/Bios/Geoff_Cruttwell/ct2014CruttwellTalk.pdf">Structures on tangent categories</a> seems to be a gentle introduction.</p>

<p>Hi! I'm Sandro, a data-scientist from Italy with background in physics.<br>
I fell in love with category theory when I read the Rosetta stone article of John.<br>
Then I liked a lot the book of Milewsky and the one of Awodey.</p>
<p>My interest in category theory is twofold:<br>
1 - a practical way to better organize my thoughts and my code when approaching the design of a program; also my work as a data-scientist implies to prove things as faster as you can sometimes (for business reasons): the better you are organized, the better and faster will be the results; and about the quality and repeatability of results, the functional programming point of view is very useful; I totally love the constructive mathematics potential<br>
2 - having a unifying view over mathematics; I have the sensation that since I start understanding a bit of category theory, mathematics seems to me more as a unique thing, instead of a multiverse of different structures which sometimes happen to have connections ; this gave me also a different perspective over theoretical physics</p>

I am interested in algebraic and arithmetic geometry, mostly through the angle of the many facets of the cohomology of algebraic varieties. My research focus is in the theory of motives and motivic homotopy theory. As such, I am mostly an end user of (higher) category theory, but I am always happy to learn more, and I am fascinated by the explosion of applied category theory.</p>

<p>What?! Them's fighting words lol.</p>
<p>CQM applied to language is one of the most amazing things I've seen coming out of ACT. It's not perfect, and people should try applying it to LOTE (languages other than English), but it's got potential.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My PhD thesis was on the application of CQM to Middle Egyptian (Hyeroglyphs). I don't agree with what you say, but maybe it's better to talk about this in private if you want to know more!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lol. Ok, I take all of that back. I had a quick look at the problems you've pointed out in the application to Middle Egyptian, and I think they're quite interesting. CQM (or DisCoCat) is probably not the be-all and end-all of applying CT to linguistics. Sometimes studying the obstructions can be useful too! </p>
<p>Since your thesis, there's been a lot of development in NLP. For example, Baidu's ERNIE (<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614996/ai-baidu-ernie-google-bert-natural-language-glue/" title="https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614996/ai-baidu-ernie-google-bert-natural-language-glue/">popular review at TR</a>, <a href="https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/ERNIE" title="https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/ERNIE">Github repo</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12412v1" title="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12412v1">arXiv preprint</a>) seems to show that insights gained in studying a LOTE can be applied to the processing of English as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have no doubt things can be improved, the main problems I saw are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>When I worked on this there was zero emphasis on learning. Some people are working to fix that but I think learning should be central, way more than it is now.</li>
<li>The functor from pregroups to whatever semantics doesn't really exist. The "fix" is to use the free CCC generated on a dictionary, but that defeats the purpose of the functor in the first place, at least conceptually. This is a huge problem but not enough people pay attention to it. It is also related to the above point: The functor should be backward, cos grammar should be learned, not imposed.</li>
<li>No one seems to have a real clue of what the "sentence space" is.</li>
<li>Other problems are nastier in nature, but the conceptually biggest ones for me are the three above.</li>
</ul>

On problem 1, there will be a paper soon on our recent implementation of DisCoCat on a quantum computer, where meanings are encoded in terms of variational learning.<br>
On problem 2, in the first paper there was no such functor, and the real problem is that grammar and meaning are not independent, so no forward nor backward direction.  On the other hand, grammar is no human invention, but a representation of stuff happening in the world out there.  <br>
On problem 3, this is now 100% settled as far as I am concerned, thanks to the evolving meanings in arXiv:1904.03478, with the meanings.</p>

On problem 1, there will be a paper soon on our recent implementation of DisCoCat on a quantum computer, where meanings are encoded in terms of variational learning.<br>
On problem 2, in the first paper there was no such functor, and the real problem is that grammar and meaning are not independent, so no forward nor backward direction.  On the other hand, grammar is no human invention, but a representation of stuff happening in the world out there.  <br>
On problem 3, this is now 100% settled as far as I am concerned, thanks to the evolving meanings in arXiv:1904.03478, with the meanings.</p>

<ol>
<li>Seems encouraging. </li>
<li>Indeed, the first paper, where instead of the functor you were using products, was much better imho. I am in a similar situation now with cryptography: A functor gives me too much relatedness, and doesn't work. A product gives me too little relatedness, and doesn't work. I think there are slick cartegorical ways to really depict what's going on there, but in the end what you wanna do is just drawing wires between things, and that's easier to implement than to formalize mathematically (!!!).</li>
<li>Yes, I remember you telling me about this. This helps a big deal, no question about this. But the idea of a sentence space is still around, albeit its inpact is reduced. For instance, when you axiomatize the verb "shoots" you do so by applying some features to the object and the subject of the action. This is a very neat thing to do (albeit I can imagine it doesn't work in some circumstances), but it may be still difficult, in practice, to say what does it mean to "apply" such features. In any case I'll wait to see what happens!</li>

<p>Hi all, I'm a (final year) CS PhD student at Northeastern University working on programming language semantics heavily influenced by category theoretic approaches. On the application side my focus is on "gradual typing", interoperability between languages and low-level/intermediate languages, and on the category theory side my interests include categorical logic generally, and more specifically (virtual) double categories, generalized multicategories and gluing approaches to formalizing logical relations</p>

I consider Stephen Wolfram a valued mentor and am working on upgrading my iterated function and hyperoperator Mathematica software for Wolfram Functions. </p>
<p>Question: Can an iteration functor map a category into the next higher category? Then I may be able to use what I've learned from studying the hyperoperators as a sequence of higher iterated functions to provide some insight into higher categories.</p>

<p>I'm Conor McBride when I'm being British, but I'm also Irish. I'm a dependently typed functional programmer with an increasingly categorical bent. In the past I have noticed a peculiar inability to learn category theory. Fortunately, I can be co-learned by category theory. It keeps showing up in the things that I'm doing, and I can't help thinking I could be doing them more deliberately.</p>

<p>Hi, I'm Todd Trimble. Have recently returned to academe after a long hiatus, but some of you may know me from the n-Category Cafe, MathOverflow, and the nLab. Among other things, I enjoy thinking about how geometry and topology enter the study of free categorical structures.</p>

<p>Hello, I'm Alex Kreitzberg. I'm a math teacher at the Prime Factor Math Circle. I'm interested in explorable explainations (<a href="https://explorabl.es/" title="https://explorabl.es/">https://explorabl.es/</a>) and educational games. I enjoy Mathematical Physics. So I'd like to understand, if only partially,  Category Theory's relationship with Logic, Probability, Analysis and Differential Geometry.</p>
<p>There are a lot of very good category theorists here, so I'll try not to be a bother.</p>

My research is mostly in theoretical computer science with a broader focus on the study of open systems that pop up in different scientific contexts. I primarily employ algebraic tools, with an emphasis on monoidal (higher) categories and diagrammatic reasoning as a unifying language. Thanks to whomever started this group!

<p>I became interested in  category theory when exploring the algebraic topology of wild spaces X such as the Hawaiian earring, with particular attention paid to the choice of topology for the corresponding homotopy groups. TOP is often an unsuitable  category for such exploration due the general failure in TOP of the product of two sequential spaces to be sequential.  Working in a different category such as SEQ turns a bug (failure to be a topological group in TOP) into a feature.</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276424">@Rongmin Lu</span>. Indeed! We had David come speak to us about his work in this area, and I've been puttering around with CQL. Hoping to turn it into more than just puttering with the Conexus folks. As for the prob prog semantics, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think Adam Sciobor does work in this area (see his thesis), and while it may not be semantics outright, I'm also including work on differentiable programming like Conel Elliot's "Compiling with Categories", and Sam Staton's recent work (papers: POPL 2019, FOSSACS 2020). </p>

<p>Hi all! I'm Emilio, a researcher at INRIA / IRIF / Paris 7 (now Université de Paris) I'm trying to make interactive theorem provers easier to use, and I'm interested in categorical logic and mechanization of CT.</p>

<p>Regarding tangent categorie: as far as I know, these are categories where each object is equipped with structure similar to the tangent bundle of a manifold.

<p>Hi, I am Aleksandar Bakic, started reading on applied and computational CT some 20 years ago from the Kestrel Institute papers. Some time later started coding up the pieces I learned in Common Lisp, as I started memorizing less and less. Recently read Seven Sketches, Functorial Data Migration and have been finishing an implementation of Left Kan Extension "directly" by stitching diagrams (using general algorithms, not chase). I work at a startup on unrelated things, have little time for chatting; mostly reading and sometimes coding alone.</p>

<p>Hi y'all, I'm Mario Alvarez, recently finished a PhD at Oxford where I used incremental computation as an excuse to do "differential calculus" on discrete spaces. I like programming languages and their (categorical) semantics, Coq, machine learning and the intersection of all of the above. Currently trying to figure out an abstract machine for reverse-mode AD, integration for change actions, and how differential equations and iteration are the same if you squint hard enough.</p>

<p>Hi everyone. I'm Patrick Elliott - I'm a visiting faculty member in the linguistics and philosophy department at MIT; I did my PhD in the linguistics department at University College London. I'm a theoretical semanticist, interested in using ideas from category theory and functional programming to model our knowledge of meaning, with a focus on the logical aspects of the latter. I write haskell, occasionally for work, and also for fun, and I'm interested in learning more about Idris, Agda, and dependently-typed programming languages more generally.  SInce this literature is probably unfamiliar to most of you, here's a recent paper I wrote using the Reader monad to model a certain kind of environment sensitivity in natural language! <a href="https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005107" title="https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005107">https://ling.auf.net/lingbuzz/005107</a></p>

<p>Hi, I'm Badreddine from Oran University, Algeria. I've used some category theory on the lattice to derive <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00529" title="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00529">transition rules for 2-connections</a>. I'm been mainly inspired by John Baez, Florian Girelli and Hendryk Pfeiffer works.</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Bobby Tosswill. I did my undergrad in linguistics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and in the last two years I've been trying to dig into category theory, to mixed effect, haha. I found out about this group (and Zulip, if I'm being honest) from a Slack group on category theory in functional programming and figured I might be able to learn a thing or two. I guess I should say ahead of time that just about all of my questions are liable to be stupid ones, haha</p>

I did undergraduate degrees in complex systems (liberal arts) and robotics (b. eng) at Dartmouth, followed by masters in stochastic optimal control at PhD in Networked Dynamic Optimization at Upenn with Ali Jadbabaie (who is now at MIT).  I run a private research &amp; design firm which has been working dynamic mechanism design and complementary decision policy design problems. Mathematically we rely on formal methods from CPS, systems engineering and control, most notably i've been working on compositions of invariant preserving mechanisms and configuration spaces for economic systems.

<p>Hi, I'm Gabo, an undergraduate student from Buenos Aires, Argentina who wants to do a PhD in math, maybe Applied Category Theory if fate permits. I chose to study Physics because I was interested in complex systems, but the usual complex systems work stemming from Physics doesn't have the right level of abstraction for me. My Physics undergraduate degree is extremely long (7 years on average) and has a very inflexible curriculum, so I feel like I've already specialized in something I didn't want to, which... Sucks? It makes me feel that, given my true interests, I "should already know" so many things that I don't... Also no one knows what "Applied Category Theory" is around here, and I haven't had the courage to talk with the few people who do work with categorical things. Anyway, I've been learning some stuff on my own, and even thinking about how to apply CT to a project I've been working on (about finite state automata). I hope to keep learning and perhaps be honored with some useful advice <span aria-label="slight smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="slight smile">:slight_smile:</span></p>

<p>Hi all! I graduated last year (Aug 2019) with a Bachelor's in CS. My research was mostly in canonical CS stuff like complexity theory, algorithm analysis, cryptography and computational geometry during my bachelor's. Then, I spent few months at Microsoft Research. </p>
<p>For my bachelor's thesis I made a switch to computational condensed matter, out of sheer curiosity towards Physics, and have been hooked since. I am now at Prof. Franco Nori's group (Theoretical Quantum Physics Group) in RIKEN, Japan as a funded research assistant for the last six months, and I will spend the rest of this year here as well.</p>
<p>My introduction to Category Theory was through following the work of Prof. Bob Coecke in the Foundations, Structures and Quantum group at Oxford (which I feel is doing some phenomenal work at the intersection of theoretical CS and physics). After this year I plan to apply for a PhD, so hopefully I can find something of interest here!</p>

<p>Hi, I'm James,  a conjoint at the University of Newcastle of Newcastle, Australia. As an economist with a passion for philosophy (in particular, Schelling, Deleuze, Whitehead, Peirce), I am interested in applications of category theory to macroeconomics, ecological economics, network analysis and, in this era of ubiquitous 'fake news', in finding more democratic modes of communication, cooperative alternatives to private property, and more decentralized and transparent governance structures. One aspect of this is would be the deployment of diagrammatic reasoning (especially, string diagrams) to regain control over machines for as Marx  observed, "The hand tool makes the worker independent –posits him as proprietor. Machinery – as fixed capital – posits him as dependent, posits him as appropriated."</p>

<p>Hello everyone! <br>
Maxime Lucas here! I am a postdoc at the University of Nantes, France, where I am trying to understand what is going on in HoTT.  Apart from that I am working on so-called "higher dimensional rewriting": it turns out that you can use (somewhat) elementary rewriting  techniques to compute resolutions of most of your favorite algebraic objects : algebras, operads, etc ! <br>
It also allows you to prove some "coherence results" <em>à la</em> MacLane, of the type "every diagram commutes"</p>

<p>Hi Maxime! <a href="http://therisingsea.org/" title="http://therisingsea.org/">Daniel Murfet</a> at Melbourne has used cut elimination to make the computation of matrix factorisations of Landau-Ginzburg models more tractable (paper <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022404917301901" title="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022404917301901">here</a>).

<p>Here are three references, depending on what you like: </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Church Rosser property and homology of monoids</em>  is the most elementary, but contains the basic idea.</li>
<li><em>Polygraphic resolutions and homology of monoids</em> is a very good introduction to the subject. It is not state-of-the-art, but it at least uses state-of-the art terminology, which I guess is useful before advancing in the litterature.</li>
<li><em>Convergent presentations and polygraphic resolutions of associative algebras</em> is the state of the art for algebras, which is probably one of the most useful application. If you know some stuff about Grobner basis, this paper also shows how they are a particular case of higher dimensional rewriting. </li>
</ul>
<p>Let me know if you want to know more :)</p>

<p>I'm thinking about cognitively inspired program induction!  In particular, humans are often able to quickly see what sort of program is needed to solve a problem --- associative thinking from remembered previous solutions helps narrow the search space.  How can we get computers to write programs from examples using similar learned heuristics?  I sort of just started, though, so this is more a dream than progress.</p>
<p>Before working on that, I was shopping for advisors and doing theoretical machine learning.  I developed some "feynman diagrams" for analyzing stochastic gradient descent, and i hope my work gets accepted this year! {Nervous}</p>

<p>Thanks!  Yeah, that's a good connection.  What sort of "sufficient statistic" or "universal essence" should we extract from previously considered tasks in order to inform a new task?  There's lots of inspiring work on meta-learning, transfer learning, and hierarchical Bayesian learning that I'm trying to absorb.</p>
<p>As for diagrams, I'd be happy to share a draft (by DM so as not to spam this thread). Thanks for your encouragement!</p>

<p>Hi everyone! I'm Reuben (they/them) and I'm finishing my undergrad in math at Harvard this semester. In math, I study homotopy theory, so I'm a user of higher category theory. Recently, my interests have been relating to factorization homology and (secondary) algebraic K-theory. I'm also tangentially interested in categorical logic. </p>
<p>I'll be "leaving math" to pursue a career in orchestral conducting (starting a masters program at the Peabody Conservatory), but I hope to stay in touch with the community :) Once you've spent a long time caring about something, it's impossible to stop caring! So while I may not contribute much, I'm so excited to see the mathematics I care about evolve.</p>

<p>Hello friends old and new! I'm a theoretical neuroscience PhD student at Oxford, though I don't like that classification: I'm interested in all kinds of structure, and particularly the structure of our ideas and of systems that might be said to have ideas. So I'm working on a few related projects: a compositional formulation of the "free energy" or "active inference" framework for intelligent systems in the setting of categorical cybernetics; a study of the simplicial structure of certain models of spatial navigation in the hippocampus; and more generally trying to understand the abstract logical structure of the neural code. I call the overarching topic "compositional cognitive cartography": I want to understand how we (and other creatures) explore all kinds of spaces, be they physical or abstract (another distinction that I dislike).</p>
<p>I do like the notion of 'deep' and 'codeep' as adjoint approaches to applied category theory. I'm starting on the 'codeep' side, trying to tunnel deeper. A slightly unfortunate side effect of this is that I've built up a backlog of "<a href="#narrow/stream/229156-practice.3A-applied.20ct/topic/mathematical.20writing/near/193675223" title="#narrow/stream/229156-practice.3A-applied.20ct/topic/mathematical.20writing/near/193675223">papers in drawers</a>" which I really need to write up. I hope to share some of those with you all soon. My feeble excuse is that I prefer working with pencil and paper to working with keyboard and screen.</p>
<p>On the methodological side, I'm attempting to introduce concepts and techniques from theoretical computer science into computational neuroscience (which embarrassingly lacks a notion of 'neural computation'). More generally, these days I repudiate much of the current structure of (scientific) academia into "disciplines" which often seem to bear little relation to the abstract structure of the objects of study. So I also hope to contribute to the effort towards more robust and ecological (more 'autopoietic') structures both in technology and society. Thanks to everyone for building this community!</p>

<p>Hi Toby! A couple of people I know have recently been inspired by the simplicial structure of models of spatial navigation to come up with a higher version of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762" title="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">Transformer</a> ANN architecture in machine learning:</p>

<p>I agree that the distinction between physical and abstract spaces is not really a distinction: there is evidence to suggest we transfer our intuition about distances in physical spaces onto abstract spaces.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>There is a prejudice, which goes back to a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/337129a0" title="https://www.nature.com/articles/337129a0">1989 polemic by a well-known biologist</a>, that computer science cannot inform neuroscience because ANNs are unrealistic. With the benefit of hindsight, this prejudice was founded upon the incomplete knowledge of our brain, and even the name "neuroscience" is a relic of that ignorance. So it is perhaps not surprising that there hasn't been a notion of "neural computation" yet.</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276424">@Rongmin Lu</span>: thanks for that link -- I hadn't seen that generalization of the transformer.

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>The evidence on this is actually very strong, not just behaviourally but also at the neural level, and I suspect that the abstract notion of "space" -- as a place where stuff happens plus some notions of restriction and gluing -- is actually ontologically prior. But I'm verging on a Platonist.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>prejudice, which goes back to a 1989 polemic by a well-known biologist, that computer science cannot inform neuroscience because ANNs are unrealistic</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Labelling this as a prejudice is a step in the right direction, but actually I go a bit further: theoretical computer science, and especially the parts that cross-pollinate with information theory and statistical physics, supplies a lot of very useful conceptual tools to understand "computation" generally (roughly as a kind of dynamics with semantics), and these go well beyond what most lay people (and indeed neuroscientists) think of as "a computer". It is this rather general type of tool and concept that I'm interested in.</p>

That toolkit will soon prove very useful in a very broad swathe of neuroscience -- there's even a subfield called "integrative neuroscience" -- and I've recently spent a lot of time studying it. I don't really do any data analysis. My interests are in the theoretical side, both with respect to "how we navigate spaces" (from paths to proofs), and also with respect to notions of natural computation, information-processing in complex systems, and cybernetics broadly.</p>
<p>As many of us have, I've been thinking increasingly about the question of "how to do scientific modelling" and "how to specify models" in such a way that we can translate models across disciplines (as they exist today). At the same time, I think we could do with better tools to assist this: how should this data be represented digitally? How is it represented inside the brain?</p>
<p>Because mathematical spaces are (for me at least) prototypical, I'm trying to figure out how, by stealing ideas from homotopy type theory, we could think about how we navigate (eg) from the premises to the conclusion of a logical deduction. The paper written at the end is a physical artefact witnessing that journey, but along the way the route must have been represented and planned inside the author's brain. And somehow this route should correspond to the abstract witness that exists in some model of type theory.</p>
<p>Anyhow thanks for the connection: I'll send you both an e-mail :)</p>

<p>Hi Rohit! DFT (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_philosophy" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_philosophy">density functional theory</a>) sounds fascinating (I thought it was "discrete Fourier transform" at first). Could you say a little bit more about it?</p>
<p>There's been some tentative steps towards applying CT to ML/AI. The most recent one is <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8785665" title="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8785665">this paper</a> by <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="276053">Brendan Fong</span>, <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="276049">David Spivak</span> and <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="276730">Rémy Tuyéras</span>, which abstracts what I believe to be the feedforward network architecture into category theory.

<p>Hi all! I'm Pablo. I'm a student from ENS and Cambridge. I just finished my master degree and am taking a year to learn category theory better before doing a phd. I am very interested in foundations of math and of category theory, in higher category theory, (homotopy) type theory, and also just category theory as itself. I'm still trying to find my way in math but I know that those subjects really attract me. I'm working on a few personal projects. To cite a few of my recent interests: I've been recently fascinated by limit doctrines, by codensity monads, by (what I just discovered may be called) directed homotopy type theory, and by necessary conditions for a sheafification existence theorem.</p>

<p>Univalence is Id(x, y) ≃ (x = y).<br>
Directed univalence is Hom(x, y) ≃ (x → y), where Hom is a thing every type has (like Id), but in the case of a universe, lines up with the (non-dependent) function type. In general, it gives a one-way notion of transportability. In set-level mathematics (or rather, poset-level mathematics), I imagine that it works as a way of enforcing monotonicity over some type.</p>

<p>Hi John :) Hawaii seems to be doing well with the virus for some reason. People hiking a lot and everyone saying hi to everyone they meet. It feels like an extended holiday at the moment. But I am sure we'll be punished by the economic carnage ahead. Are you home in Riverside? I hope it is less bad than in some other parts of CA.</p>

<p>I'm a CS prof who was formally educated as a mathematician (specializing in analysis and complex dynamics), worked professionally in symbolic computation (Maple) for 11 years, before returning to academia. I'm extremely interested in 'mechanized mathematics'. As should be no surprise to anyone here, meta-mathematics is full of categorical "stuff", which I'm trying hard to leverage to good use. I have gotten bitten hard (in a good way) by a few things in the last few years: category theory, dependent types and meta-programming. One day, I will manage to stuff all 3 in the same paper.</p>

<p>Hi. My name's Dean and I'm finishing a degree in mathematical physics at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. I recently just submitted a dissertation in semigroup theory, where most of the research I did into the literature of the subject involved abstract notions from category theory.

<p>I work as a researcher at a trading firm. I used to be a grad student proving theorems about quantum computing. Now my academic interests cluster around the question "how do we leverage technology to accelerate mathematics research, including via new communication methods and via changing incentive structures?" I hang out a lot on the leanprover chat. </p>
<p>I'm currently thinking about approaches to tame the constructions of MIP* = RE using categories. (To give a sense of what stage it's at, I have a category of "games" and "simulations" such that the product and coproduct in this category correspond to some of the constructions in the CS literature. I haven't yet proven that the natural map from games to C^*-algebras is functorial. I think that the "introspection game" from the MIP^* = RE paper will end up being an exponential object in this category.)</p>

<p>Hello everyone, I am Jon Sterling, a phd student in computer science working on Homotopy Type Theory and related topics. I am applying category theory to logic and computer science, but I currently almost exclusively work on the "universal property" style of applied category theory and not the "monoidal structure" side. I am currently interested in learning more about infinity categories and infinity topoi.</p>
<p>My research is currently focused on what I refer to as the <em>Objective Metatheory</em> of dependent type theory, using invariant, conceptual, and categorical methods to replace intractable problems of syntax by tractable problems of semantics. I am also an implementer of proof assistants.</p>

<p>Not to be overly negative, but my interests now are different from what they were when I was working on those, and I think that unfortunately Nuprl-style type theory can have zero application to my current areas of interest, both for some simple reasons that are well-understood and for some complex reasons that are poorly understood. I don't have time to go into it right now though.</p>

<p>I have great respect for the Nuprl project as one of the first serious type theoretic proof assistants, and also because they came up with a lot of ideas that are now "standard" and whose origins are sadly forgotten. The specifics of Nuprl, though, are maybe best left to the shadows of history and a better way to pay it respect is to follow in the legacy by creating new and fun tools based on type theory.</p>

<p>And to be clear, I don't want to be sectarian about this and start painting people into corners ;-) All I will say is that for the kinds of questions I am currently interested in, the main leverage of category theory for me has been in the emphasis of universal properties and distinguishing the parts of disciplines-of-application that require some creativity from the aspects that are "trivially trivial" (a matter of paperwork).</p>
<p>Category theory is also amazingly well-adapted as a language for organizing complex structures that are not universal, and this aspect of the application of category theory (often under the banner of compositionality) is a fast-growing and fascinating area of research about which I am not currently an expert.</p>

<p>I'd also like to point out that there is an intersection between the "universal property" style of CT and monoidal structures,  one can use tools from formal CT to study monoidal structures in Cat. a nice example is this note about <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mpf23/Notes/daytensor.pdf" title="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mpf23/Notes/daytensor.pdf">2-categorical day convolution</a>, and also the constructions related to <a href="http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~pmtng/Publications/generalised-species.pdf" title="http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~pmtng/Publications/generalised-species.pdf">generalised species</a>.

<p>Yes, there's a lot of overlap and there will be more in the future.   For example, my more recent work on networks starts using "universal property" ideas more heavily:</p>
<ul>
<li>John Baez and Kenny Courser, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04630" title="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04630">Structured cospans</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Already using left adjoints instead of lax monoidal functors makes structured cospans easier to set up than decorated cospans.  But the serious business starts when we show structured cospans are morphisms in a weak category internal to Rex, the 2-category of finitely cocomplete categories and right exact functors.</p>

<p>Hi everyone. I am a theoretical physicist working on quantum codes, which is a subfield of quantum computing. It's generally accepted that quantum computers will eventually need to use some kind of codes to protect the precious qubits. By another example of the weird efficacy of mathematics in physics, the most promising quantum code comes from (is?) the cellular homology of a 2-dimensional manifold. And this idea overlaps with condensed matter physics: such a "code" can be seen as a simple example of a 2d topological quantum field theory. So while I wait for someone to actually build one of these things, I get to think about a lot of cool mathematics, much of which involves category theory.</p>
<p>I also have a semi-regular collaboration going on with James Dolan. James is interested in categorified algebraic geometry, homotopy theory and the Langlands program. These big ideas are so big, possibly eating all of mathematics, I have a suspicion that they also have a lot to do with quantum computing. We will see.</p>

<p>I am a phd student at the Perimeter Institute. Broadly speaking, I am interested in abstracting techniques and methods used in (quantum) information theory, both for the purposes of better understanding the physics, but also more generally to map out the science methodology at play. A bit more specifically, I think about resource theories, as they offer a nice way to understand physics from a more agent-centric and less reductionist perspective, in contrast to the classic narratives. As such, I would like to extract the lessons learned in this context and see where they lead.</p>
<p>Other than that, I am also interested in causal inference, both in the classical and quantum domain.</p>

<p>Hello, I'm Nikolaj Kuntner. I usually say I got a PhD in physics (officially it's in aerospace engineering, practically it's in plasma chemistry, but I did my masters in something like Riemannian geometry derived from Matrix models). I currently work in computer vision for a US company, so I might be responsible for the SO(3)-representation elements being multiplied on your phone once you turn on some apps. Funfact, to compute the opening angle of a rotation it might pass from a 4-component quaternion to a 3x3-rotation matrix, simply because the relevant functions are already there and the risk of messing something up by attempting to map from the quaternion to the angle directly are not worth it. I have a vlog (<a href="https://youtu.be/E7V36JvHbsA">https://youtu.be/E7V36JvHbsA</a>), implementing this and that, trying to be a little more general and explicit about the underlying theory that's used. I interacted with a lot of people here before, on the nForum, or the distributed computing space, etc., but I also see a lot of names now that I don't know, so here's my Introduce Yourself.</p>

<p>Hi everyone, I am Joscha Diehl from Greifswald (<a href="https://diehlj.github.io/">https://diehlj.github.io/</a>). Coming from Stochastic Analysis I'm interested in (noncommutative) algebras since they serve as book-keeping devices for various things there (the prime example being iterated integrals). This year I am looking into operads and homological algebra, to get a broader view on things. Happy to discuss noncommutative, nonassociative algebras, operads, as well as TDA!</p>

<p>Hey all. I'm a data scientist with a electrical engineering background (information theory, graph theory, bayesian statistics) with a pretty weak background in category theory and abstract math in general; I've always been an applications first person. I've found that my intuitions often line up with abstractions from category theory, but that I don't always have the mathematical language to realize that! I'm working through Riehl, Fong, and Spivak's books in order to rectify that terminology gap and so I can understand the elegance of some results from category theory more formally.</p>
<p>Domains that I'm interested in that I think category theory can bring some nice abstractions to: include causal inference/ probabilistic graphical models and network theory (especially directed hypergraphs, networks of oscillators, complex adaptive systems). I'm particularly interested in the applications to meta-science (think <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/automating-scientific-knowledge-extraction">https://www.darpa.mil/program/automating-scientific-knowledge-extraction</a>) and to dynamical systems work in computational epidemiology, biology, and neuroscience. As such, super interested in sheaf theory, topos theory, hodge theory,  and (stochastic) petri nets. I've been eagerly playing with the tools built by James Fairbanks (and the rest of the Julia community) and reading all the work from Fong, Spivak, Tuyveras, Baez, and now Evan Patterson's thesis in a hand-wavey fashion, and hoping to go back later with some more rigor.</p>

<p>Hi, I did a PhD in motivic homotopy theory, but have been skipping around Homotopy type theory, non-classical propositional logics, the outskirts of number theory, like quadratic forms and the field with one element. And I love topos theoy!  I just became a lecturer in computer science at Düsseldorf, Germany. I am not much of a computer scientist yet, but I am trying to become a valuable member of my department (or at least not the lamest duck) - so I want to learn about Topological Data Analysis, and all kinds of applications of category theory in computer science. Especially if they are AI or data science related. I don't think many people in my department know what a category is, so I am grateful for story lines that start in very concrete computer science situations and lead naturally and/or successfully to category theory...</p>

<p>Hi Jules,<br>
Our hope, at Cavenwell AI, is that Category Theory, and especially it's role in the foundation of data science, can help companies automatically learn the overall theory for their products, be they physical or software systems.   I liken the application of Cavenwell AI to industrial settings to that point in the history of science between the basic work on understanding electricity and the development of Maxwell's Equations.  Companies do not have concise theories for their products.  Rather, they have the application of the myriad of scientific disciplines to localized facets of their products.  We hope to empower their scientists and engineers to more completely understand, and thus improve, their products.  </p>
<p>Thank you for asking!!</p>

<p>Hi, I'm a faculty member at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics working mostly on the foundations of quantum theory.  I work on causal inference, contextuality, nonlocality, information theory, thermodynamics, symmetry, and resource theories.  I'll be speaking about how to unscramble the omelette of inferential and causal concepts in classical and quantum theories.</p>

<p>I'm an outlier. I'm a very old man. And I am not academic, and don't know very much Category Theory, but I have a hunch it is related to our work, which is why I am here observing this delightful forum. </p>
<p>I am part of <a href="http://mikorizal.org/">http://mikorizal.org/</a>  - we work with live groups who are experimenting with new economic relationships, sorta sloppy participatory action research.

<p>Hi Timothy! Welcome! I took a short course with Stephen when he was one of the lecturers, together with Mark Kisin, in the Algebraic Structures stream of the inaugural AMSI Winter School at the University of Queensland back in 2004. I think he taught some representation theory and Mark taught some number theory. Good times!</p>

<p>Hi, I'm a software engineer interested in functional programming and type theory. I know a little bit of category theory and joined this server to participate in discussions in the new categorical statistics reading group: I've got interested in statistics quite recently after finding out that causal inference is a thing and getting really interested in it. Since the idea of making connections to other areas is really appealing to me, I would like to learn how category theory applies to this area.</p>

<p>Hi everyone, I am a 2nd year PhD student in Mathematics at IISER, Thiruvananthapuram, India. I am learning Higher Gauge Theory and Higher Geometry mainly from the work of <em>Baez, Schreiber , Waldorf, Wockel, Bartels, Jurco, Nikolaus among others.</em> Recently I started working on a problem in this area. Till now I am only using the  ideas of upto 2-categories. But in future I want to use the ideas of Higher categories i.e n-categories and infinity categories in my work . I have seen some papers which uses the higher categorical ideas but currently I am not equipped well with the machineries needed to understand those concepts. I am trying to learn infinity categories from <em>Kerodon (Lurie)</em> but I am feeling it is very dense and it will take a long time for me to understand these higher categorical ideas. I am also reading parts of <em>Introduction to Language of Stacks and Gerbes by Moerdijk</em> suggested from <em>An Invitation to Higher Gauge Theory by Baez and Huerta</em> to understand about Non trivial 2 -bundles.  Also I am interested in Homotopy theory and Model categories. <strong>Lastly I am very much interested in using the abstract ideas of Pure Mathematics to tackle Real World Problems. So Learning some Category Theory and Learning how to apply ideas of the same in Real World are my greatest motivation to join this community.</strong></p>

<p>Hello everyone. I'm an Asst Prof in Physics working at the National Institute of Technology Karnataka (NITK) India. I work in quantum gravity and high energy theory. I favor the Loop Quantum Gravity approach over String Theory, though I'm working on understanding their similarities and connections. My interest in Category theory started as a curiosity as an undergrad some 17 years ago, but only matured into a serious interest  over the past couple of years when I realized that it can possibly provide a unifying language for quantum gravity. I also write a blog at <a href="https://www.quantumofgravity.com/blog">https://www.quantumofgravity.com/blog</a> on various topics in high energy physics.</p>

<p>Hello everyone, I am a fresh (1 week) PhD student with UTS in Australia. I have a background in education / mathematics and I've been delving into Learning Analytics and various educational data sets. I'm hoping to apply CT to the problem of context in an analysis / study - so basically if the framework of CT can help articulate the issues of moving between spaces like the 'real world' and 'data' and if what is lost / gained along the way has implications for trust in the end result. I feel like just the language of CT might help, but I'm also hoping that it might be applicable enough to solve some problems directly. (Just caught 1/2 of the tutorial day for ACT2020 and it was excellent)</p>

<p>Hi! I’m a PhD student in data-driven systems biology at the Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden. My background is in theoretical computer science (BSc) and complex adaptive systems (MSc). While I’m enthusiastic about many things, my current focus is on modelling living systems. My thesis project involves characterising the proteome (the set of proteins and their interactions) in yeast cells. A parallel (and more long-term) interest is in bridging / reconciling different types of models and frameworks.</p>

<p>I'm a final year undergraduate at IIT Kanpur (India) My majors is Material Science, but in the last four years I've dabbled a lot, from theoretical condensed matter physics (clean and random Ising), Knot Theory(Khovanov Homology, Ribbon Categories), Gauge Theory (fibre bundles formulation, leading up to getting polynomial invariants from Chern Simmons); TQFTs (Entanglement Entropy calculations using the Atiyah definition of TQFT), classification of defects (using Homotopy Theory, inspired form Mermin's result), one constant in all projects or readings I undertook and even currently am is Category Theory. Since, I'm an Engineer by degree (just graduated) doing so much CT made me feel different from the rest of my class. I am also very driven towards Cognitive Science and Neuroscience and I keep looking for bridges and ways CT can be made a language neuroscientists can think in, (in my dreams I feel this will bring Grothendieck like revolution to the field) So far I've found some works which try to aim in the direction by Gomez Ramirez, Brown and Porter, Andrée Ehresmann. But, I feel very anxious because I don't know where do I fit in and if I will be able to contribute as much I feel driven to, further in academia. <br>
I can't even ascertain the departments I should apply to for Grad school, especially given the COVID scenario, the uncertainty has increased many-fold (manifold? anyone) When I came across this conference, thanks to the smart AI of Google who learned from my searches and recommended ACT2020 in my feed, I was delighted. This is the best thing to experience sitting at home. Thanks to the organizers. <br>
I would love to have any pointers from anyone present here as to how I (as an engineer, who used to make flexible printed electronics) should go forward touching neuroscience and physics simultaneously with CT sword in my hard (which needs a lot of brushing, sharpening because in this group I probably know the least CT).</p>

<p>Hi Alex! I am Adittya, currently a 2nd Year Phd student from India working in the area of Higher Gauge Theory .  I especially liked  <em>"I’m interested in math pedagogy and human/social processes. I tend to enjoy thinking across disciplines and category theory has provided nice frameworks for that.</em>" Personally I am also curious about understanding human/social Process but I do not have much  idea about how to approach it using category theory. It would be a real pleasure if you kindly share about your views/thoughts in this regard! Thank you!</p>

<p>Hey folks! I'm Erik and I'm a software developer at Statebox based near Amsterdam. I got interested in CT through functional programming, and have been hooked since I first learned what a functor was.</p>
<p>To throw out some things I'm interested in: programming languages and methods, computation, databases, music, literature, forest walks, many things medieval, petting sufficiently small animals, and lately also topology and assorted topics in economics, physics, etc.</p>
<p>I've met a good number of you around Oxford, Schoorl, Tallinn, Berlin, etc. and it's been a pleasure. It's very nice to see familiar names and faces around here, as well as unfamiliar ones, and I look forward to lurking around and talking morphisms and whatnot.</p>

<p>In a set theory course at Columbia University in around 1967, my friend Nick Yus introduced me to category theory via algebraic topology. A couple of years later, Ralph Abraham introduced me to Lawvere (in a Parisian pub). In 1968 I audited a course on category theory given by Samuel Eilenberg. In Summer 1969 I attended the Summer Seminar in Category Theory at Bowdoin College, where I attended the lectures by Saunders Mac Lane (where he presented my example of continuous map as an adjunction). By Fall 1969 I was enrolled as a student of Lawvere at Dalhousie University. My best friend was Radu Diaconescu. I did <em>not</em> impress Lawvere much at all, and I went over to be mentored by Barry Mitchell. We became friends over ensuing decades, mostly by telephone. A couple of years ago he said, "You know, back then you were not as good as you thought you were." This sort of hurt my feelings, except that I do not recall thinking myself as good at mathematics. Enthusiastic, way yes, quick-minded, not. I am still enthusiastic. My passion is to categorize my choice of modern theoretical biology, the part of systems biology that leaves genetic reductionism aside, and moves to the realm of biological autonomy. The first step is to take care of adequately explaining micro and macro thermodynamics. Then there is the matter of explicating a recent foundational principle called "closure of constraints."</p>

<p>Hello, I'm from the industry side, in software. Currently working at <a href="http://rjginc.com">rjginc.com</a> where we enable process analysis and machine control for plastic injection molding. Besides some java programming, mostly what I'm doing day to day is designing software systems and helping coordinate between teams. Long time fan of functional programming, written some (very basic) Haskell. So I'm glad to have found Bartosz Milewski's blog and videos to work through. I'm inclined to learn category theory so I can finally understand haskell :P, and also inspired by things like the Azimuth project, and plus its just fun.<br>
<em>edit to add</em><br>
Big fan of NixOS, a GNU/Linux distro composed of software packages defined in the nix language (<a href="https://nixos.org/">https://nixos.org/</a>). Highly recommend it, if you have trouble managing software dependencies. This way you can have those same problems but at a higher level :) also if you are more free software or LISP minded, there is <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/">https://guix.gnu.org/</a></p>

<p>This is my first time saying anything here, so "Introduce Yourself" seems appropriate. I'm Joe. This server is an incredible resource.</p>
<p>Also, I have a question, but I'm unsure where to put it, so I'll leave it to a moderator to categorize. My question is, why does the diagram for equalizers differ from the diagram you get when you create it by taking the limit of a formal diagram, i.e., a functor? This is the typical diagram for equalizers:</p>
<p><a href="user_uploads/21317/velk54sR-jG2i33G6mHknr96/IMG_0174.PNG">IMG_0174.PNG</a></p>

<p><a href="user_uploads/21317/SquhiZelvCrJaXO0PE_QyZ0q/IMG_0175.PNG">IMG_0175.PNG</a></p>

<p>As a side note, I find it interesting that the syntactical representation of the categorical product distinguishes both targets of the cone legs. That is, in the product A x B, both constituent objects appear. This allows us to define the functors like - x B, which is left adjoint to the exponential (_)^B. Equalizers, on the other hand, are not syntactically represented as the composite of two objects.</p>

<p>If we make the index category just two objects with a single morphism between them, we get this diagram,</p>

In Set, it looks like the limit is the set of pairs (x, f(x)), i.e., a function. It's as if the additional f: X -&gt; Y morphism constrains the product set X x Y to the subset where elements are (x, f(x)). Adding more morphisms then constrains the pairs to be (x, f(x) = g(x) = ... = z(x)), for all morphisms f, g, ..., z: X -&gt; Y.</p>

<p>I am a software developer.  However, while the practical side of CT is of course interesting to me, I would like to learn about it from a mathematical point of view as a subject in its own right.  My interest in mathematics comes from its own inherent beauty.</p>
<p>However, I only have books and the occasional video to teach myself.  I have been told I'm intelligent, but all my more mature mathematics has been self-taught (beyond what I learned in University where I was an Engineering student, which was mostly linear algebra applied to signal processing) and sometimes I get stuck and, admittedly, a little obstinate.  I am the proverbial baby learning how to crawl.  </p>
<p>I'm not sure this is the right place for me, but let's see how it goes.</p>

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>Originally a physicist working on quantum optics, moved over to Astrophysics for my PhD, completed a postdoc on the same field, later got a faculty job which I eventually left to work on the healthcare industry. I came in contact with CT a couple of years ago and have been learning on my own ever since. Been through a couple of books,  occasional papers and a few vids, which left me with: tons of unanswered questions and no one to help me solve them.</p>
<p>Really glad to be here, looks like the place I've been looking for</p>

<p>Hello everybody!</p>
<p>I am finishing my CS undergraduate degree and already started taking some classes for a mathematics master's degree. I always loved programming languages and last year finally got around to implementing one. This little rabbit hole led me to learn about Haskell, lambda calculus, and type theory. Now I can say I have a new passion for proof assistants, category theory, and type theory. I am still very much a beginner and very enthusiastic about that!</p>

<p>This is where I talk about category theory... I talk about many other things on my blog <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/">Azimuth</a>, and these days I'm talking about nonstandard models of arithmetic on Michael Weiss' blog <a href="https://diagonalargument.com/">Diagonal Argument</a>, and other math questions on <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/">The n-Category Cafe</a>.   Maybe I should make it a bit easier to find everything in one place.</p>

<p>I thought that if one contributed to the HoTT book, as you did, that one counted as a Category Theorist :-) Is there such a gap? There are conversations here on that topic, such as this one on <a href="#narrow/stream/232163-learning.3A-history.20of.20ideas/topic/HOTT.20Book">the HoTT book</a>.</p>

<p>There's also a HoTT zulip, though, where questions about HoTT might find a higher ratio of interested folks.  The HoTT book does assume more category theory background than would be ideal, and category theory is a very useful tool in type theory, but the subjects are quite distinct.</p>

(I remember people getting their knickers in a twist for an array of reason, when some others on twitter where posting about how hard category theory is, along with screenshots of their notes on modular arithmetic and Lagrange's theorem)</p>

<p>It is not clear what you are responding to, and so what your 'it' refers to. I'll assume it is the previous post in the "Introduce Yourself!" thread, and in particular the sentence " It's the only thing that can explain how it is possible for Category Theory to be discussed on Twitter." <br>
I think here is is fundamental to understand the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect">network effect</a>, which is a very interesting mathematical principle, about the  faster growth in the number of connections on a (telephone,...) network as it adds new nodes, and so the value of the network as a whole. All of silicon valley is built on this. From the internet itself, to the market clout of Microsoft products, to the success of Facebook, etc... It's a mathematical principle they understand and take very seriously. The more users are on a system that is about connections grows, the more value the system gains as a whole, as it is easier to make connections.</p>

<p>Hello everyone.</p>
<p>My background is in computer science, working as a software engineer nowadays. My interest in programming languages (Swift, Go, Rust atm) and type systems led me to category theory. Hoping that theory and practice can meet together to make software easier to develop.</p>

<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I am a designer/developer who turned to category theory after finding a lot of patterns reappearing in different basis in my work. I found out that Category Theory is a great setting to rigorously study patterns in general. To start learning it, I have been looking at various starter materials and collecting the ones I found together to get an understanding for what resources are out there. I put all the great stuff I found together as an annotated bibliography. I am a beginner at this and would love to hear thoughts and feedback from people here on it. This is the repo: <a href="https://github.com/prathyvsh/category-theory-resources">https://github.com/prathyvsh/category-theory-resources</a></p>
<p>It would be lovely if someone can point me to any great resource that I have left out. Also, great to join a focussed platform to discuss about Category Theory and I hope to learn a lot from you all!</p>

<p>If you <em>want</em> to add another reference, I'd suggest the 3-volume book by Borceaux, <em>Handbook of Categorical Algebra</em>.   It's packed with stuff everyone eventually wants to learn if they go far enough in category theory - and despite the title, it's not heavily biased toward "algebra".</p>

<p>Sets for Mathematics is more so category theory (but with a focus on the category of sets) than traditional ZFC-based set theory. If you're looking for a good logic and set theory text, Peter Johnstone has a very slim (approx. 100 pages) book 'Notes on Logic and Set Theory' .</p>

<p>Hello all <span aria-label="wave" class="emoji emoji-1f44b" role="img" title="wave">:wave:</span> .<br>
My name is Kale Evans. I am a Software Engineer. Most notably, I've worked at The MathWorks, and currently Spotify. I am very interested in jumping back into theoretical mathematics, principally via Category Theory, and applying it to a host of real world problems. I am also interested in engaging with all of you. Super happy to be here.</p>

<p>Hi all!</p>
<p>I am Sacha Ikonicoff, I have finished my PhD last year in Paris, Muriel Livernet was my advisor, and I am starting a postdoc in Calgary with Kristine Bauer. I study algebraic topology and especially algebraic operads, I also studied unstable cohomology and I guess I would be tagged as working in homotopy theory.  Category theorist were my prime interlocutor in Paris, and they still are here, so I am glad to be part of this group. <span aria-label="tada" class="emoji emoji-1f389" role="img" title="tada">:tada:</span></p>

<p>Hi everyone <span aria-label="wave" class="emoji emoji-1f44b" role="img" title="wave">:wave:</span> </p>
<p>It's great to be here and to see so many familiar names <span aria-label="blush" class="emoji emoji-1f60a" role="img" title="blush">:blush:</span> </p>
<p>I sometimes refer to myself as the "jester in the court of kings" being old friends with John Baez and Urs Schreiber going back to the ancient sci.physics.research days (anyone remember that? <img alt=":old-man:" class="emoji" src="https://zulip-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/21317/emoji/images/19230.jpg" title="old-man"> ) and the early days of the String Coffee Table and the n-Category Cafe.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of my research experience was publishing a preprint with Urs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0407005">Discrete Differential Geometry on Causal Graphs</a></li>
</ul>
<p>back when I was at MIT Lincoln Laboratory (2004). The work resulted from some things I started in my dissertation in computational electromagnetics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (2002).</p>
<p>Sadly (as some might say), I sold my soul and went to work in Wall Street in 2005 and have had a long career in financial services since then, but I always tried to keep one foot in research by publishing occasional informal articles on my <a href="https://phorgyphynance.wordpress.com/">blog</a>.</p>
<p>As a mathematician, I am certainly a "fool", but when it comes to engineering (science or finance), I think I don't do too bad. I am pretty sure I can claim to be the first person to ever apply noncommutative geometry to mathematical finance <span aria-label="nerd" class="emoji emoji-1f913" role="img" title="nerd">:nerd:</span> </p>
<p>Six years ago, I left the corporate world and have been on my own working on various startups with some successes and some (painful) failures. Recently, I decided to get back to my old research bridging higher maths with practical applications and am definitely open to collaboration (so don't hesitate to get in touch). </p>
<p>I am somewhat of an evangelist for the Julia programming language and think it has huge potential for applied category theory. I believe a "killer app" is automatic differentiation a la Conal Elliott and <a href="https://sciml.ai/">Scientific Machine Learning</a>. I am active on the Julia Zulip where it has been fun to see world's collide with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275965">@Evan Patterson</span>  and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275927">@James Fairbanks</span> attracting a lot of category theorists over due to the awesome work they are doing on <a href="https://algebraicjulia.github.io/Catlab.jl/dev/">Catlab.jl</a> and building up the <a href="https://www.algebraicjulia.org/">AlgebraicJulia</a> community..</p>

<p>hi everyone! Yes, I have been around for a while, but I would like to introduce myself, as I have a favour to ask.<br>
I'm Valeria de Paiva, I work in the Topos Institute and I like to use category theory in many different applications. Now I am very keen on making sure that women are not short-changed in their professional lives and I am very much  against 'manels', panels with only men on them. So, for the favour, I would like to have a list with women in Category Theory.  I would like women here to go to the google doc <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lb3zW7Zk-KI0mY0x7dLZ0pHFeLLeobc5itTBrtVBwAo/edit#gid=0">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lb3zW7Zk-KI0mY0x7dLZ0pHFeLLeobc5itTBrtVBwAo/edit#gid=0</a> and add themselves to the list. The rules are very simple: no need for a PhD, no need for a(n academic) position, no need for reputation points. anyone who wants to work with category theory and identify as a woman can add their names, please.</p>

<p>Hi there!  Moerdijk's approach is a bit more semantics based, drawing from NSA directly through the Robinson route in a sense (i.e via the underlying idea of ultrafilter), while Palmgren's constructive NSA uses similar ideas to that of my starting point (E. Nelson's Internal Set Theory).  My main inspiration is actually an old paper by A. Kock and C.J.

<p>hi @Peter, I first worried about the same. Had an exchange almost ten years ago with Catarina Dutilh Novaes, me saying that there would be Viagra ads all over the list of Women in Logic, she saying we'll worry about it when it does and she was right. We haven't had issues, so far. Women in Programming Languages  have their list in GitHub, but  the point here is not to make sure category theorists know how to use github, but to make the old excuse that people don't know women doing CT even more lame. (I don't understand it, as I keep having to remove rubbish from even slideshare comments...)</p>

<p>Adelaide doesn't have a category theory group, let alone topos theory. I'm officially employed on a grant looking at K-theory. Danny Stevenson does homotopy theory/oo-categories. Raymond Vozzo is a differential geometer who works on gerbes. And that's the closest we've got. I recommend Adelaide as a city to live in, but getting an academic job is a different matter. Dom Verity or Richard Garner would have a better idea about options for actual CT jobs in Australia.</p>

<p>Hello everyone, I'm a postdoc at RIKEN CBS (Centre for Brain Science) in Japan.</p>
<p>When it comes to categories,  I'm only just starting, but thanks to people like <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276071">@Nathaniel Virgo</span> (who so kindly introduced me to CT and this community) I feel like this may lead me into some really cool topics + ideas. 'Normally', I'm working somewhere between theoretical neuroscience and AI. But also theoretical biology, control theory + inference/filtering + information theory, etc. </p>
<p>I have a keen interest for cross-disciplinary approaches (to any kind of problem really), and for common topics that seem to appear in different fields (it all started with the duality of inference and control, Kalman and many others after him). This is probably the main reason I thought CT would be of great help: what are the fundamental components of all these things that I like and that seem to pop up in apparently unrelated fields?</p>
<p>To give a few key words that might help place me (but don't make me an expert on): </p>
<ul>
<li><em>cybernetics</em>, which I know is a topic already of interest to some here and one of the main reasons for me to like cross-disciplinary ideas (control theory + info theory + neuroscience), </li>
<li><em>active inference</em>, in some sense a modern reading of some topics originating in cybernetics (how do we use <del>info theory</del> inference + control to understand what brains do) over which I worked during my PhD (in some ways also after that), and which is potentially interesting for at least another person here :P (even with all of its problems).</li>
</ul>
<p>It is quite likely I'll spend some time just lurking for now, especially in the streams (with questions) for beginners, but in the meantime, nice to meet you all!</p>

<p>Hey, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="278008">@Spencer Breiner</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="403646">@Manuel Baltieri</span>. First of all, welcome <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="403646">@Manuel Baltieri</span>, and thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="278008">@Spencer Breiner</span> for @ing me:  I find this place quite overwhelming so only log in occasionally.  I should say that my ACT talk is somewhat troublesome and I've been working on cleaning it up quite significantly.  I've now got quite a general scheme for describing the structure of active inference systems as an indexed functor from an indexed category of statistical games (describing the statistical part) over polynomials into an indexed category of dynamical systems (of various kinds), also over polynomials.  I don't like to announce things before I'm feeling secure in them, so I haven't said much recently.  But I gave a talk sketching some of this material recently, and the slides are at <a href="https://tsmithe.net/papers/20210317-cgt-talk.pdf">https://tsmithe.net/papers/20210317-cgt-talk.pdf</a> -- that talk didn't cover much of the "active" part of "active inference" (which is where the polynomials come in), and I'm writing that up at the moment.  I also believe that, in 'nice' cases, the indexed functor I mentioned should have a right adjoint which associates to a dynamical system a "canonical statistical game", but I haven't finished working the details of that part out.</p>

<p>We worked on it a bit, but not much (it's difficult to really think about abstract trading theory in such a bull market!).

<p>The _very_ funny thing about trading (that usually makes physicists/dynamical systems people go galaxy brain) is that they work as self fulfilling prophecies: The "dynamical system" at play is just the resultant of the single choices of all traders. So, if, say, everyone uses EMA indicators to make decisions, this choice itself will end up influencing the price, making the EMA indicator being predictive in some sense</p>

<p>for instance, make the unreasonable assumption that everyone starts selling when the daily graph crosses the EMA200 from above. That being the case, said event will inevitably push the price further down. So, detecting this crossing becomes an effective indicator for trend inversion. Clearly the reason why this often does not work in practice is because different traders use different strategies, indicators etc. So you need to properly understand market sentiment to be able to read indicators correctly. <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span></p>

I'd love to chat! My first startup was a little prop fund that used RSI really heavily, this is really interesting stuff!</p>
<p>You're  <span aria-label="a" class="emoji emoji-1f170" role="img" title="a">:a:</span> bsolutely right that traders spend a ton of time setting up their trading systems - it's why everyone is still stuck in VBA and MS Excel :(  <br>
Categorifying these indicators is a really interesting idea for tool development! IIRC, the black-scholes model is basically a re-wording of some model from physics, so making the ideas more transferrable like you're describing sounds like it has a lot of upside! </p>
<p>When you say untractable, do you mean that it's tough for any one individual trader to move the price? There are also a few different environments  (OTC markets, periods of illiquidity, interbank traders) that the price can move from buying large chunks of stock or from the seller discriminating based on who's buying.  Offline, I can tell you how some traders get around this haha.</p>
<p>I'm also thinking it could also be modeled as discrete, would that make it easier? At an operational level, and depending on the asset/exchange/flow, the price may have artificial 'ceilings' and 'floors' from the limit orders and exchange halting. </p>
<p>The inter-asset/intra-asset self-fulfilling prophecies are all too real, I can still feel the stress of stop-loss slippage. It's really interesting to think of all these price changes as just buy/sell volume proportion at different intervals of time</p>

<p>Hi Valeria, nice to meet you too! And oh wow! I was just reading <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W17-7205.pdf">your paper on annotations in the SICK corpus</a>- I'm working on an annotation tool for coreference - I'd love to hear how you think about grounding/explicitation of referents for inference, and your work on entailment! Would it be O.K. if I emailed you?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="395604">@Joe Brucker</span> , we actually have 3 papers on SICK( one on entailments, the one in contradictions you're reading and one about "one-word-apart" pairs of sentences in SICK). I thought in 2016 that SICK would be an easy place to test the new neural nets emerging from Google at that time, the Parsey McParseface times. but we're still working on it 4 years later! oh well.  </p>
<p>Katerina and I have these nice demos for our work: GKR Demo--<br>
<a href="http://lap0973.sprachwiss.uni-konstanz.de:8080/sem.mapper/">http://lap0973.sprachwiss.uni-konstanz.de:8080/sem.mapper/</a> describes our KR system, while Hy-NLI Demo-- <a href="http://lap0973.sprachwiss.uni-konstanz.de:8081/gnli/hynli.jsp--">http://lap0973.sprachwiss.uni-konstanz.de:8081/gnli/hynli.jsp--</a> is an overview of our hybrid--neural and symbolic-- inference system, if you're interested. Katerina just defended her PhD in Konstanz. So to your question, we don't ground things explicitly, we use WordNet and a generic ontology SUMO for our concepts. and sure, please email, I'd love to chat more.</p>

I'd love to chat! My first startup was a little prop fund that used RSI really heavily, this is really interesting stuff!</p>
<p>You're  <span aria-label="a" class="emoji emoji-1f170" role="img" title="a">:a:</span> bsolutely right that traders spend a ton of time setting up their trading systems - it's why everyone is still stuck in VBA and MS Excel <span aria-label="frown" class="emoji emoji-1f641" role="img" title="frown">:frown:</span>  <br>
Categorifying these indicators is a really interesting idea for tool development! IIRC, the black-scholes model is basically a re-wording of some model from physics, so making the ideas more transferrable like you're describing sounds like it has a lot of upside! </p>
<p>When you say untractable, do you mean that it's tough for any one individual trader to move the price? There are also a few different environments  (OTC markets, periods of illiquidity, interbank traders) that the price can move from buying large chunks of stock or from the seller discriminating based on who's buying.  Offline, I can tell you how some traders get around this haha.</p>
<p>I'm also thinking it could also be modeled as discrete, would that make it easier? At an operational level, and depending on the asset/exchange/flow, the price may have artificial 'ceilings' and 'floors' from the limit orders and exchange halting. </p>
<p>The inter-asset/intra-asset self-fulfilling prophecies are all too real, I can still feel the stress of stop-loss slippage. It's really interesting to think of all these price changes as just buy/sell volume proportion at different intervals of time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, by "untractable" I mean that this supposed dynamical system depends on a huge number of variables, basically on all the moves and internal belief system of any trader out there. So it's not something that can be reasonably simulated or analyzed. The best thing you can hope to do is to define some metrics that, for some reason, give approximate predictions for this system</p>

<p>Obviously since things change all the time, some metrics may be predictive in some interval/timeframe, and some may not. The example you make with the RSI is indicative: If you look at markets in crypto on the short timeframes, the RSI is often quite predictive. If you look at the monthly candles of ETH the RSI basically pierces the screen and goes up and up and up weeeeell beyond what any rational human being would consider a reasonable level to buy lol</p>

<p>Hi! My name is William Waites. I belatedly realised that there was an "Introduce Yourself" topic here. I work on things like graph rewriting for studying biological systems -- currently epidemics at LSHTM for somewhat obvious reasons, but previously things like synthetic genetic circuits and vertex models of epithelial tissues (sheets of cells one cell thick). In the more distant past I also did telecommunications engineering and also some semantic web stuff. Despite having been exposed to CT for many years, it's only recently started to sink in and I find that I understand what I have been doing a lot better now. I'm really interested in trying to more systematically bring the insights from the CT understanding of composable open systems to the kind of modelling work that happens in biology and population health. Nice to meet you all!</p>

<p>Hi! My name is Tim Campion. I am a 6th year PhD student of Chris Schommer-Pries at the University of Notre Dame. In the fall I will start a postdoc with Emily Riehl at Johns Hopkins University. I am also a moderator at MathOverflow.</p>
<p>I would describe myself as a category theorist at heart who likes to dabble in other mathematical fields while secretly (or not-so-secretly) pretending that they are all category theory. I am particularly interested in <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord">∞</span></span></span></span>-categories and homotopy theory (which have become roughly synonymous for me). With others, I have done work in cubical homotopy theory, and also work attempting to apply the techniques of categorical homotopy theory to classical model theory.</p>
<p>Between some familiar faces I haven't seen in awhile and unfamiliar faces, I'd like to get to know the folks here better. DM me your favorite universal property!</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="410456">Francesco Genovese</span> ! your work on twisted sheaves of perfect complexes seems really interesting to me (I work with twisted cochains, which i guess must be somehow equivalent, since they also give a dg-enhancement!)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>hi! actually they are just dg-enhancements of derived categories of twisted sheaves and it's a work in progress - hopefully out before the end of this academic year! In any case, I still at least a bit familiar with twisted complexes of objects in dg-categories, there is another work which explores them as a possible variant of projective or injective resolutions</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="395604">@Joe Brucker</span> , <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="405160">@ww</span> nice to see others with semantic web past here. (We also have <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="390165">@Eric Neumann</span> lurking here and I am sure a few others). <br>
I have been working on the Semantic Web since 2004 and got to see the value of Category Theory by using it programming in Scala starting around 2011. Somehow around 2016 I ended up  taking 4 years off on a (self-financed) PhD which allowed me to study CT deeply, but then ran out of money. Luckily I received funding this year from the EU to work on a project called "Solid Control" where I am writing a Read-Write access controlled web server <a href="https://github.com/co-operating-systems/Reactive-SoLiD">Reactive Solid</a>. This is allowing me to learning by doing, as I try to apply the concepts I read about. (But it is taking a lot of time, as it is milestone based and I set some slightly too ambitious milestones <span aria-label="grimacing" class="emoji emoji-1f62c" role="img" title="grimacing">:grimacing:</span> )<br>
There is a discussion thread <a href="#narrow/stream/229156-practice.3A-applied.20ct/topic/web.20cats">Web Cats</a>, for discussion on Web and Category theory related topics.</p>

<p>Hello. My name is Zhen Lin Low. I studied category theory at Cambridge and obtained my PhD in 2016. I have been out of academia since then, but it turns out one can never really stop being a mathematician. My research interests include topos theory, categorical logic, and abstract homotopy theory. It seems everything has gone remote/virtual over the last year or so – perhaps I should go to a virtual conference and try to catch up with everyone!</p>

So as to not invoke a "you know nothing of my work" moment, how would you characterize the research that has been done so far on a CT interpretation of learning theory? IIRC you were equivocal/skeptical about it, but then there were a few publication that made a convincing case for it (I will move this somewhere else, sorry didn't mean to take up room here).</p>

<p>Hi. I first learned of CT through Haskell. For years my MO has been to read an nlab page, not get it, and months later there's a level-up chime. When I encounter a confusing mathematical object I try to write down all the morphisms I can find, then see if the diagram has a name. I was sent here to ramble as I search for CT foundations for Scott Garrabant's talk on finite factored sets.</p>

<p>I have the same question. I started studying simplicial methods in homological algebra because monads are a basic structure in computer science logic and categorical semantics, and I wanted to learn about their history and how they originated. So I went back and read a bunch of the early work on this stuff - Godement's book on sheaf cohomology where he shows that you can use simplicial sheaves constructed by the bar resolution of a monad to give simplicial formulas in sheaf cohomology for the cup product/cross product/Steenrod squares, Barr and Beck's work on acyclic models and homological algebra with respect to a monad, stuff like that. It does seem that wherever you have monads you should be able to define some of the basic concepts of simplicial homotopy theory or cohomology, and I am wondering whether it's possible to give an interpretation of these cohomology groups or homotopy groups in the context of the monads arising in computer science logic or formal semantics (an interpretation that would be interesting to computer scientists, I mean.)</p>
<p>I'll mention one specific example of a monad I'm interested in. In Bart Jacobs' book on categorical logic and type theory he gives a very interesting argument that basically all the higher level notions of logic (quantification, equality, logical operators) are ultimately determined by the structural rules of weakening and contraction through some adjunctions related to them. These weakening and contraction operations fit together into a comonad in the category of propositions; this comonad is kind of the logical backbone of the category, as all of the other features of the logic are necessarily determined by it. I would be interested in whether you can define homotopy groups with respect to this comonad which are interesting.</p>
<p>I also want to point out that topos theory has been very influential in categorical logic and type theory, and this also originated in sheaf cohomology theory. It seems like more than a coincidence that both monads and topoi originated in sheaf cohomology specifically and jumped to computer science logic. Surely there is more going on here than the mere coincidence of the same formal structures appearing in both disciplines.</p>
<p>More recently I've begun to think that a lot of the constructions of simplicial homotopy theory or simplicial methods in homological algebra are best understood in terms of monoidal category theory, as the category of simplicial sets is the free cocomplete monoidal category with distinguished monoid, and the category of simplicial Abelian groups is something similar but with Ab-enriched dropped in appropriately throughout, so I have been trying to work out to my own satisfaction sufficiently "monoidal" derivations of many basic notions of simplicial homological algbera.</p>

<p>Very interesting research <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="424412">@Patrick Nicodemus</span> . Thanks for making those connections. I hope I'll get time to follow up on those some time.<br>
Regarding simplicial sets and computing I found the paper "On the Geometry of inutionisic S4 proofs" by Goubault which looks at the geometry of programs, and a later paper (nearly 20 years later) on simplicial sets and epistemology which is easier to read. <a href="#narrow/stream/229156-practice.3A-applied.20ct/topic/web.20cats/near/224017954">links here</a>.</p>

<p>I'm happy with what I've been able to figure out so far but I'm not really tied into any community or familiar with the literature so I have no idea how much of what I've been coming up with is new or novel. I'd be happy to talk about it in more detail for this reason so I can understand the relationship between what I've been doing and the existing literature. Hopefully all this isn't known or out of vogue. But I'll give you an example. Recently I came up with what I think is a satisfactory a priori account of what chain complexes are and why they exist. Given any simplicial set, we can interpret this as a formal schema for gluing together copies of a given monoid in a category and its higher tensor powers, the usual geometric realization of this is the special case where the monoidal product on Top is taken to be the join, and the distinguished monoid is the singleton space. In my opinion this gives a very good motivation for what simplicial sets "are" because for any cocomplete monoidal category C with distinguished monoid M there is a unique cocontinuous strong monoidal functor from SSet to C sending the n-simplex to M^{n+1} and preserving the unit and multiplication maps of the monoid. (Here the monoidal product on SSet is Day convolution.) Now we can characterize SAb the same way, if we say that the category C should be Ab-enriched, and tensored over Ab, say that the tensor product Ab\otimes C -&gt; C is cocontinuous in both variables. So given any simplicial Abelian group X, there is a "geometric realization" of X with respect to the monoid M, computed by a coend \int^{n\in \Delta}  X_n\otimes M^{n+1}, which tells how to glue together M and its higher tensor powers according to the face and degeneracy maps of X. It turns out that if you simply sit down and compute this coend, all the degeneracies of X dissolve and you are left with the Moore normalization of X. Similarly the cosimplicial object n \mapsto M^{n+1} has a dual kind of Moore normalization M' which is a cochain complex in C, and the original coend simplifies to \int^n N(X)_n \otimes M'_n. <br>
So, by purely computational motivations, i.e. trying to compute the "realization" of a simplicial Abelian group, we are naturally led to replace it by its Moore normalization, and this can give some a priori justification for the notion of chain complex (it is a reduction of a simplicial Abelian group which suffices for the purpose of gluing together monoids in additive categories and their higher tensor powers)</p>

<p>Hi, I am Martin. Some people probably already know me from my <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/users/2841/martin-brandenburg">posts </a>(sometimes I also find them via a google search and try to understand what I wrote back in, say, 2013), but anyway here is a short introduction followed by some questions.<br>
I am from Germany and finished my <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.1716">PhD</a> in 2014 on the interplay between algebraic geometry and category theory. Similar to Zhen Lin (from whom I learned a lot!) above, I am outside of academia since then and do lots of other stuff (activism, drumming, programming, ...), but cannot really let go of math and in particular category theory.<br>
Now my <strong>questions </strong>(if they belong to a different stream, let me know): What is the purpose of this zulip workspace? Where can I read something about its development? In which case (and this is sort of my main question!) would you prefer to ask a question here and not on mathoverflow or stackexchange and also not use the category theory mailing list? To be honest, I find the layout of zulip incredibly confusing and the structure unnecessarily complicated, and for this reason I am not really active here. But someone told me to be there and of course I am curious where all of you are hanging out. As you see, I am still trying to figure out what this is all about.</p>

<p>There are streams for people to discuss specific topics, connections of CT to other branches of math and science, a general questions stream... people often start new streams to go along with a conference, so people can ask questions and discuss in a more permanent way than zoom chat. I also suspect a lot of the activity that happens here is in the form of private group chats.</p>

<p>I think a description of the structure of Zulip has been written out a few times, but I couldn't point you to it. The top layer is "streams", these are like broad umbrella topics. Inside a stream are many "topics" that are more like specific conversations. Admins and maybe other people can rearrange these if necessary, so it's not a big deal if you start talking about something in the wrong place. You have to seek out and subscribe to streams.</p>

<p>Exactly which messages are displayed is uh, easily manipulated. So "all messages" will put everything you're subscribed to in chronological order. You can make it so you only see the messages in a stream, in a topic, in private messages, or just pms with one person, or one group chat.</p>

<p>I guess you would go to StackExchange if your have a well defined question. They tend to shut questions down if those don't fit into a specific pattern, and they don't necessarily have that much humour. But there is a <a href="#narrow/stream/229451-general.3A-off-topic/topic/math.20jokes/near/210955402">math jokes channel here</a>, though it needs a bit of reviving :-) <br>
So I think there is a space where you need more dialogue to get to understand a question than is afforded by SE, which is also very good.</p>

<p>As for why to go here rather than to a mailing list, my own answer is that "it seems to be what everyone else has done".  I don't know why they did it; maybe they also did it just because it was what everyone else did.  But once everyone is here rather than on a mailing list, you have to come here if you want to talk to them.  (-:</p>

<p>I guess one slight advantage of zulip over a mailing list is that you can choose which streams to subscribe to, and you can mute particular topics.  So if there's a long conversation going on that I'm not interested in, I can unsubscribe from that stream or mute that topic and I'll stop getting notified about it.</p>

<p>Hello all, I'm Sean Gloumeau from Barbados! I graduated from MIT in May of 2020 in AeroAstro focusing on controls, real-time systems, telecommunications and am just about to get started on an Erasmus Mundus Joint Masters Degree in Embedded Computing Systems. Even though I absolutely love math, a calculus proof-based math class broke my spirit in my first year as an undergrad, so I decided to pursue it more as a hobby since then. Now that I'm getting into research I really want to marry math into my papers, and Category Theory has caught my eye. I really love reading Tai-Danae's pieces (including topology from a CT perspective which I'm very excited to read in its entirety), and looking into the Fong-Spivak applied CT books and lectures on YouTube. Since I have a year before I choose a research topic, my main goal is to learn as much CT, and as many examples of application, as I can! I believe lurking and interacting with others on this zulip will aid me quite a lot, so thank you all for having me <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span>!</p>

<p>Hi Everyone, I'm Hart Montgomery from San Francisco, CA.  I'm a research scientist in cryptography at Fujitsu.  I've become interested in category theory through a pretty circuitous route:  over the past few years, I (with some wonderful, very smart coauthors) have written some papers connecting public-key cryptography (and more powerful cryptographic primitives, like fully homomorphic encryption if you know what that is) with mathematically structured simple primitives (i.e. one-way functions or pseudorandom functions, and again, apologies for the cryptographic terms).  It seems like mathematically structured computational hardness assumptions are required in order to build certain cryptographic primitives (and in some cases, we can prove this explicitly, although we would obviously like to be able to prove more powerful statements in this regard).  However, sometime last year, we (myself and others working on these problems) realized that we didn't have strong enough tools for handling the mathematical structure in the types of proofs we wanted to write about this, and thus needed to learn category theory.  So here I am!</p>
<p>If anyone is interested in "computational category theory," I'd love to hear your thoughts, and please feel free to reach out.  Thank you all very much for your time, and I'm looking forward to learning from this community.  Thanks again!</p>

<p>Thanks for the kind words!  I took a quick look at your paper.  It looks interesting, but I haven't had time to go through the details.  In the intro, you say, "To do this, we bypass the problem of modelling cryptographical primitives categorically..." which is what we have basically tried to do.  Our formulations are probably pretty appalling to properly trained mathematicians though--some of this is due to the difficulty of modelling computational primitives, and much of it is probably due to our inexperience and lack of knowledge of category theory.  If you're interested, I can share a manuscript, although I'll need to check with my coauthors first.</p>

<p>Hello! I'm Hugo. I graduated a few months ago from Berkeley, and I hope to apply to a math PhD program this fall.</p>
<p>I would really like to learn more about CT and computation, the fact of a connection between which is awesome. In particular, just from naively reading nLab I'd be very curious to work through a precise description of the Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence. I've also gotten the idea that categories with various levels of axiomatized structure "admit various computations" like taking pullbacks, factoring morphisms...! And they have different "internal logics", which I don't understand. I'd really like to have an oversimplified model of the circle of ideas here.<br>
I've also just found Lawvere's 1969 article ( <a href="http://emis.matem.unam.mx/journals/TAC/reprints/articles/15/tr15.pdf">http://emis.matem.unam.mx/journals/TAC/reprints/articles/15/tr15.pdf</a> ) seeming to abstract the fixed point approach to the halting problem and Gödel's first theorem (and other stuff) to a property of CCC's. This is all absolutely incredible to me and a lot to take in. Is there any "categorical" model of computation which is Turing complete/nicely related to the classical ones?</p>
<p>I guess the question I'm ultimately going to end up asking here is, what should I do next if I want to seriously pursue these topics? In particular where should I apply to grad school? Many of the non-US centers of research seem to expect a masters before entering their PhD programs. </p>
<p>Anyone's advice, thoughts or reading recommendations would be extremely appreciated. My sincerest thanks to this community for existing and being open; that's another thing I'm struggling to wrap my head around.</p>

<p>Hi! <a href="https://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/VIGRE/VIGRE2010/REUPapers/Berger.pdf">This paper</a> by Carsen Berger contains a precise description of the Curry--Howard--Lambek correspondence. (I personally believe the formal Curry--Howard correspondence is somewhat tautological, but it's nice that it's written down somewhere.)</p>

<p>Olivia Caramello gives a yearly course on subjects related to topos theory at the master's level at the uni of Insubria. (That's beginning graduate level for y'all Americans out there.) I've heard it is rare to find courses on the subject at that level. Of course one has to hang on tight.</p>

<p>Hello all! I am a data guy at a municipal health department, though my bachelor's was in physics. As I have confronted my office's deficiencies in the modeling and control of the knowledge that underlies our work, my curiosity led me to read about categorical databases. This and some self-study rekindled my passion for mathematics, especially Statebox's dazzling introductory CT cram course, taught by the lovely <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276438">@Fabrizio Genovese</span>  (thanks for the invite!). Roughly my biggest interests are the engineering, and the physics, of information (systems). I am not totally sure where this new phase of math study will take me (I have recently enrolled for part-time, non-degree study with NetMath at UIUC) but so far I have greatly enjoyed the fascinating discussions that take place here.</p>

<p>Hi everyone!<br>
My name is Jacob Zelko and I am a researcher at Georgia Tech Research Institute and the Centers for Disease Control.<br>
I have formal training in biomedical engineering, biomedical informatics, and medical anthropology and currently serve as the PI in an observational health characterization study.</p>
<p>I was exposed almost by chance to Category Theory through working with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275927">@James Fairbanks</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275965">@Evan Patterson</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276589">@Sophie Libkind</span> and other members of the AlgebraicJulia ecosystem.<br>
I was greatly smitten by the ideas in CT as I had been thinking for several years about knowledge management and information systems - going so far as to read some old papers pertaining to cybernetics and control theory.<br>
When I stumbled across CT, it just made complete sense and I was sold on the idea as it helped me put in order my thoughts on relating the typically unrelatable.<br>
Currently, my interest in Category Theory lies in determining how to compose research studies in order to create novel research studies - especially in the domain of observational and public health research. </p>
<p>As an aside, I have a vested interest in visualization as I am the co-creator of the <a href="https://github.com/Wikunia/Javis.jl">Julia Animation and Visualization engine, Javis.jl</a>, and am currently exploring methods of creating a tool to create commonly used visualizations in CT research through my <a href="https://github.com/TheCedarPrince/LuxCat.jl/">small side project, LuxCat.jl</a>, while interoperating within the AlgebraicJulia ecosystem.<br>
Furthermore, I am the author of a small website called <a href="http://jacobzelko.com/C3T">Crash Course Category Theory (C3T for short)</a> that contains my notes as a non-mathematician learning CT.</p>
<p>Pleasure to be here!</p>
<p>P.S.  For fun, here is an animation of an upcoming feature made by a Javis contributor named John and an example of a diagram representing a simple ACSet defined in Julia!</p>

<p>Hi I'm Miguel, or rather MA, for short. My life started high in energy (Math. Physics) and I've been gradually radiating off on my way through Stat Mech, Biology and now working in IT. I never found the right/enough time to learn beyond the basics of CT and I'm hoping being here around reading and possibly asking questions may help me get beyond that 101 level. So thanks for having this running and being welcoming.</p>

<p>John Baez sent me an invite, and here I am.  In my retirement from the military-industrial-intelligence complex, I am looking into understanding the universe as it really is and not as one would like it to be.  Discovered The Laws of Form while reviewing Stan Tenen's book "The Alphabet that Changed the World."  Discovered Burkhard Heim's Extended Quantum Field Theory, and then his Theory of Everything, and realized that the Laws of Form provided the axioms for Heim's Theory.  It has been a wild ride since then.  Just came to the understanding that, as George Spencer-Brown wrote, if something is obvious from experience, but very hard to prove, then it is probably very close to an axiom of the real world.  Turns out the Jordan Curve Theorem is hard to prove because it is a statement of the definition of a distinction in the Laws of Form.  This turns topology on its head, and means that the world is quantized by area.</p>

<p><strong>Larry Harper</strong>I am Larry (Lawrence Hueston on the list of users) Harper,  Professor Emeritus in Mathematics at UC Riverside. I have been applying CT to combinatorics since  1965 when I discovered a notion of morphism for Ford-Fulkerson flows on networks.  After several years of proving Sperner-type theorems for ranked posets (the largest antichain is the largest  rank) using FLOW morphisms, I decided to look for morphisms of other combinatorial problems.  I did not have to look very far: My first paper (1962) had solved the edge-isoperimetric problem on the graph of the n-cube and I realized that the techniques that I and others had used to solve similar problems on combinatorial structures were actually morphismological. The morphisms for those problems were analogs of symmetrization, the transformations that Jakob Steiner had used in 1840 to give the first rigorous proof of the classical isoperimetric problem in the plane. So I called the morphisms for combinatorial isoperimetric problems "Steiner operations". In 2004 I published a monograph on Steiner operations entitled, "Global Methods for Combinatorial Isoperimetric Problems". Currently I am writing another monograph entitled, "The Morphismology of Combinatorics" to summarize what I have learned since1965 about the application of morphisms and the categorial structure they generate to solving combinatorial problems.</p>

<p>Hi all. I’m Dean. I was glad to join since I was just thinking about the Baez Dolan perspective on entropy. The paper they have axiomatizes entropy but the proof itself recourses to the old view in a sense. I thought folks might like to hear about the proof I found which is both simple and stems purely from the axioms Dolan and Baez came up with (which resemble the axioms of K_0).</p>

<p>Hi there everyone! I'm Jake! I've been into categories since I feel in love with algebraic topology, and naturally found myself diving deep through the nLabyrinths. I've been influenced by the ideas of too many of the incredible names I see in this chat. I've been hoping to join for a long time, and it's a pleasure to be invited here. Thank you, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="281272">@Sam Tenka</span> ! I am also a friend of <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="332609">@Dean Young</span> , who I see just joined too.</p>
<p>My main interests are spread all over all the places. Haha... but lately I have been thinking about 'everything classifies something', univalence, holography, modulation, modality (cohesion etc), tangles, cobordisms, groupoidification, species, Goodwillie, Chu and (co)bar stuff, coends, 'tensorality'. Idk, just kind of my palette of ideas, connotations and contexts.</p>
<p>I have a strong desire to see stuff synthesized, and I contemplate my measures of pleasures in these syntheses. I think about variation–integration in analogy to analysis–synthesis, and I wonder if higher (co)monadic, spherical diagrams and their duals can capture nestings of modalities. I use cooking metaphors a lot, like 'this geometry tastes spicy and slightly under-baked'. (Sidenote: do you think we might benefit from topologizing qualia? It might taste good idk/lol)</p>
<p>Sorry to make such a long introduction. Like I said, I am really happy to be here! <span aria-label="peace sign" class="emoji emoji-270c" role="img" title="peace sign">:peace_sign:</span>️</p>

<p>Haha, neither am I really. What kinds of shapes of qualities do all 'tensor things' share? That would be my initial qualification of the neologism, beyond it having a slight ring to it. Maybe 'tensorality' is better, or just different. But I do think about co-Yoneda and whatever higher double categories should be, and Loregian's(?) 'Einstein notation for profunctors'. Can we have 'coordinate-free' functor calculi like how we do coordinate-free differential geometries? Idk, but THAT should be 'tensorious' in my book, hahaha</p>

<p>As I haven't formally introduced myself,Hello there :) My journey into category theory is/was very chaotic - while in the first year of a CS degree I noticed that every seperate topic had 'structures' and 'things going between them' and also bought an ereader so I basicaly burned myself out of uni (which i was doing better than school at) by going deep into the CT rabbit hole with various branches of math before and after that (information theory for example).one of my favourite subbranches are categorical logic/semantics and internal structures and i've been thinking about how to apply the 'structural' part of category theory to the current wave of machine learning/AI ever since to make it less throw-stuff-at-the wall-and-see-what-sticks.For personal reasons (the burnout being the main one) experimenting with my ideas practically in code is hard for me.Also,sometimes I dip into developing small games or if i get an idea for an interesting mechanic (usually involving some form of procedural generation,one book put it nicely - it feels like you're playing with infinity),but that's just basically developing coalgebras with the players' actions (or lack thereof) as the transitions  :) experimenting with ML is hard cause of the compute requirements but I had some small victories there.Basically currently I'm a madman stuck in the nLabyrinth :D</p>

<p>That was meant to be to seperate things mentioned but since you ask,I have one idea for using discrete AI planning (STRIPS formalism for example) to try to procedurally generate puzzles,quests etc.There's already a paper on this  but not exactly what i have in mind - basically doing the reverse of planning - generate the sequence of actions first (the puzzle,which could be constrained in various ways),and then generate the strating situation in which that plan could be executed.And since planning formalisms are basically a complex labelled transition system (guess) thats the connection with coalgebras :) I already have a very buggy procedurally generated puzzle game up.</p>
<p>coalgebras,as I see them,are an abstraction of moving around a statespace constrained by the actions available.</p>

<p>This is amazing! I dream of an abstract machine that procedurally generates procedural generators, and to describe it using 'higher adjunctions' in (∞,∞)-categories (better names are out there I am sure). But imagine if we could model, say, Dwarf Fortress, using a basis of nice constructor constructors? The 'Calculus of Constructions' has proven very adaptive, I don't see why we can't dream in that direction.</p>

<p>I haven't yet grasped what the two numbers (n,m)-category mean but am familiar with enriched/n-categories.The intuition for adjunctions that finally stuck with me and i wrote about in the 'around machine learning' thread is an information theoretic one,but why do they give rise to (co)monads/nice (co)algebras is still beyond me.Good to know there are people thinking about PCG and CT though :)</p>

<p>Hi everyone.</p>
<p>My name is Carlos Zapata-Carratala. I finished my PhD in the School of Mathematics of the University of Edinburgh a couple of years ago and I am currently the president of the <a href="https://semf.org.es/">Society for Multidisciplinary and Fundamental Research</a> while I continue with my mathematical research and look for postdoc positions. I am currently based between Edinburgh (UK) and Alicante (Spain).</p>
<p>I first came across category theory due to my work in differential geometry and the mathematical foundations of physics. I was introduced to the subject by Tom Leinster and his students here in Edinburgh. I have recently refocused my interest in category theory due to my current research on higher order systems and, in particular, higher arity structures in mathematics, physics and computer science.</p>
<p>The main goals of the higher arity research project (which I lead) are outlined in our website that went online recently:</p>
<p><a href="https://arity.science/">https://arity.science/</a></p>
<p>Athough the project as a whole is highly interdisciplinary in scope (we have collaborators ranging from biology to art history), what pertains to category theory, and the reason I am excited to join this online community, is that we are looking for higher arity generalizations of the basic notion of category. This means, in particular, increasing the number of objects related by morphisms in a way that is generally non-sequential and doesn't necessarily conform to an input-output framework. Notions  such as operads and poly/multicategories (and their higher generalizations) are steps in the right direction for the sort of generalizations that we are searching for, but they are still firmly anchored in sequentiality and input-output, i.e. they are all largely formulable in terms of directed graphs, put simply "they are mostly about arrows". The idea is to take (directed or otherwise) hypergraphs as a starting point for higher arity analogues of category-like objects.</p>
<p>There is some work on this topic of higher arity categories from <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF01229967.pdf">Topentcharov</a> in the 1980s but it doesn't seem that much more has been done in that direction. Any pointers to relevant literature are greatly appreciated. We have rediscovered an example of a known structure called a heapoid (a partial ternary operation satisfying a slight modification of associativity) where our approach seems to clarify things greatly and it paves the way to finding meaningful n-ary generalizations of associativity. We describe this in our recent paper:</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05456">Heaps of Fish: arrays, generalized associativity and heapoids</a></p>

<p>Notions such as operads and poly/multicategories (and their higher generalizations) are steps in the right direction for the sort of generalizations that we are searching for, but they are still firmly anchored in sequentiality and input-output, i.e. they are all largely formulable in terms of directed graphs, put simply "they are mostly about arrows".</p>

<p>You may also be interested to look into operadic categories, which are a generalisation of structures that be described by "pasting schemes".</p>

<p>That does follow the general ideas that we are interested in, as I mentioned polycategories are instances of higher arity generalizations of categories. The problem that I see with polycategories is that they are not very "primitive" as n-ary structures in the sense that composition is still a binary operation on morphisms. An easy example of a ternary (pre?)category is the class of sets and ternay relations. If we understand composition as a generalization from binary relations, i.e. an operation that takes several relations of a fixed arity and gives another relation of the same arity (the usual case is a pair of binary relations compose to give another binary relation, which in our eyes is the prime example that motivates the usual definition of composition of morphisms in categories), then there are many posibilities. In section 4.3 of our previous paper we identify at least 10 different well-defined composition operations taking trios of ternary relations on sets: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09738">https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09738</a>. This means that if there exists a satisfactory definition of "ternary category" understood as a collection of objects and ternary morphisms that compose in a particular way, it is far from being unique.</p>

<p>Is there an ELI5 introduction to operadic categories and "pasting schemes"? As an example of what I'm looking for: both the original Joyal paper and the Bergeron et al book on Species is a comfortable read for me. Something like that.</p>

<p>Hello all, <br>
I'm Mohamed Rashad, MSc. Student in Computer Engineering at AAST Cairo, Egypt. <br>
I do category theory for Machine learning mainly for my degree, and I've been studying Applied CT for the past 2 years, </p>
<p>I actually "discovered" category theory in my undergraduate years, when I was studying electronics/comm related topics and software at the same time, and I found by intuition that we can move between electronic/control/signal/comm systems almost easily using some informal ways (you know, engineering hacks and so), and it's accepted in the industry, while also having good models for these systems (I can easily verify the correctness of any electronic circuit for example).. yet I didn't find this in the software world, where everything seemed to be like plumbing to me, and only making things work-ish.. so I started researching how to use control theory in designinig software, while studying abstract algebra on the side.. one thing and the other, I was studying theoretical CS and going through Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondance, that's when I discovered category (and type) theory.. and I explored some articles and stuff.. then it all linked together and It's like I've found my lost child :D </p>
<p>Since then I've been dedicating myself to category theory (and with less attention type theory).. in order to explore this area, and help bring these amazing tools of categorical thinking to the industry.. which is influencing my MSc. work right now.</p>
<p>Anyway, long intro, I'm very happy to be around, also thanks to <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275901">@Jules Hedges</span> for the invitation <span aria-label="victory" class="emoji emoji-270c" role="img" title="victory">:victory:</span>  hope I can be an addition to the community <span aria-label="smiling face" class="emoji emoji-263a" role="img" title="smiling face">:smiling_face:</span></p>

<p>I am algebraic geometry PhD student currently working on regulator problems from Higher Chow groups and different variants of such. I proved surjectivity for different variant of higher Chow groups that my supervisor invented. Apparently also these variant could be used for Physics. I am also very interested in Physics as well so in my spare time I study it. Nice to meet everyone! Hopefully we can have great discussion in future.</p>

I got interested in CT (through the wonderful "7 Sketches" book) as the means to capture the semantics of the CPS deeper than semantic web technologies allow today.</p>
<p>Right now I am learning bisimulation and coinduction by going through (Sangiorgi 2011) on my own in order to study the properties of federated rule execution, but feel that I need some help.

<p>Hello everyone,  </p>
<p>My name is Guillaume (french for William). I am a M2 student at Université Paris-Cité. Actually, it is my second one. The first one was about theoretical physics (gauge theories and differential geometry). </p>
<p>My interest for Physics lead me to the duality between algebra and geometry. A big part of it is Isbell duality. To take into account any kind of algebra, I have learnt enriched category theory. Until today, I have studied algebraic geometry, a bit of differential geometry and of homotopy theory. I am also interested in what logic can tell us about algebraic and geometric structures, also I have some basis in mathematical logic, but less than any mathematical logic M2 student. </p>
<p>To sum up, nowadays, I am interested in all the applications of enriched category theory (especially Physics and Logic) and all what can give a new viewpoint on this. </p>
<p>Hope to learn great categorical things with you!</p>

<p>Hi everyone,<br>
I don't think I've introduced myself yet (possibly because I didn't realize there was an introduction channel, but shhh...).<br>
My name is Logan Hyslop, I am an undergraduate at UCLA, currently entering into my second year.  I'm currently just exploring my interests, but I quite enjoyed reading condensed math and now analytic geometry, I like categorifications so I am very excited that Professor Rouquier is teaching a course on higher representation theory this Fall, especially since I took a course on Khovanov homology last Spring which was quite fun.  I am currently also working on learning infinity category theory, through <a href="https://emilyriehl.github.io/files/elements.pdf">Riehl's text</a>, which I really really really enjoy reading (it's an amazing book so far and I will talk about it constantly with whoever will listen).<br>
Some other things about me, pronouns he/him/his, I have ADHD, and enjoy sailing.  I actually set up a <a href="https://loganhyslop.github.io/">webpage</a> recently (though it definitely needs a lot of work before it's actually any decent).<br>
I guess that's my introduction, so <span aria-label="wave" class="emoji emoji-1f44b" role="img" title="wave">:wave:</span>.</p>

<p>Hi everyone,<br>
I just joined the category theory zulip last week! My name is Jason Parker, and I'm currently starting my third (and final) year as a postdoctoral researcher at Brandon University in Brandon, Manitoba, Canada, working with Rory Lucyshyn-Wright. I'm especially interested in enriched algebraic theories and monads and their various applications to mathematics and computer science, and I've recently developed an interest in applied category theory as well (especially applications of category theory to databases). My website is <a href="https://www.jasonparkermath.com/">https://www.jasonparkermath.com/</a>. Before starting this postdoc, I did my PhD at the University of Ottawa on <em>isotropy</em>, a topic that was co-invented by one of my advisors, Pieter Hofstra, who died unexpectedly this past spring. Philip Scott was my PhD advisor as well.  I will write a more detailed post in the "our work" stream sometime this week!</p>

<p>Greetings -- I'm Michael Stone, and I'm a mid-career technology generalist with experience and interest in systems, safety, security, software development, ML, NLP, and an undergraduate math background from a decade ago that included a summer research experience focused directly on 2-categories, string diagrams, and Moggi's paper on monads.</p>

<p>(My website is <a href="https://mstone.info">https://mstone.info</a>. Anyway, in recent months, I've spent some quality time thinking about algorithms for <em>drawing</em> diagrams, particularly a flavor that is commonly used for depicting hierarchical control systems in some corners of the systems engineering world, resulting in a free software package, <a href="https://mstone.info/depict/">https://mstone.info/depict/</a> + <a href="https://github.com/mstone/depict">https://github.com/mstone/depict</a>, which I have recently become re-interested in categorifying / formalizing.)</p>

<p>(Specifically, one aspect of this software that I am interested in studying more carefully is an observation that the drawing process I have discovered, bugs notwithstanding, seems to me to be expressible as a composition of a series of ~4 information-preserving transformations or elaborations that each have the flavor to me of being possible compositions of adjoint functors -- although I am unfortunately still at the very beginning of trying to formally state and then check this intuition.)</p>

<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I’m Hugo Bacard. I’ve been hanging around for while but I'm kind of a "e-shy" person. I think it's time to introduce myself :). So far my interests were in homotopy theory, especially in [weakly] enriched category theory. I would like to learn and do a research work in applied category theory and in ML. I live  in the Paris area (in France :D).</p>

<p>Hello everyone,<br>
I learned about CT Zulip thanks to Prof Dmitri Pavlov, who was kind enough to send me a link.<br>
I've been here for some time now but have never introduced myself yet (maybe because I'd never given that a thought until now). So here it comes.</p>
<p>I'm Amartya, an undergraduate student interested in (stable) homotopy theory, higher(model) category theory, higher topos theory, HoTT and categorical logic. I've also recently been interested in Higher Algebra, Higher Operadic stuff and intermediate model structures on simplicial presheaves. I've also been thinking about higher realizability models of HoTT for some time now, which is a work in progress(about which I'll talk a bit at CaCS 2022). Some more details may be found on my <a href="https://amartyasd.github.io/">website</a>, which I set up recently (which needs a lot of work, to be fair).</p>
<p>I look forward to keeping learning stuff here.</p>

<p>Hi everyone, I'm Javier Calvo, an industrial engineering faculty at Oregon State University (I met some of you at the NIST workshop last November). My main research focus is on systems science and how it relates to systems engineering and the purposeful human activity systems that make it work. I am in no way well versed in CT, but I believe that since CT and systems science are both transdisciplinary in nature, there is a path to integrate both to formalize systems science and to enhance the perspectives CT possesses (I admit this possibility may already exist within CT, but with your help and guidance we can make the relations explicit).</p>

<p>Hi all. I've been on this server for a while but never did one of these.</p>
<p>I finished a master's degree in math at Edinburgh a year and a half ago, with a dissertation on topology and category theory. (But I'm originally from Boston.)</p>
<p>I created the <a href="https://www.oebp.org/welcome.php">On-Line Encyclopedia of Bongard Problems</a>.</p>
<p>I'm a big fan of the contributors to the n-Category Cafe. And I've learned a lot through the nLab. I like multicategories and PROs and PROPs and other gadgets like these. I'm particularly interested in coming up with simple visual ways to think about things.</p>
<p>I'm currently finishing up PhD applications. If anyone has any pointers for places/people to apply to, with deadlines that still haven't expired, I'd appreciate them.</p>

<p>Hi everyone, I'm Benjamin Lyons. I did a BS in economics at George Mason University and am now studying abstract maths as a non-degree student at the University of Colorado Denver. I'm hoping to study category theory in graduate school, with an eye toward applications in economics and neuroscience. If anyone has any ideas about places or people to reach out to in pursuit of that goal, I'd greatly appreciate it. Also, if you want to talk about category theory and what it might mean for econ/neuropsych, let me know.</p>

<p>Did you consider getting a PhD in, say, neuroscience and trying to also work with some category theorists?  If you get a PhD in neuroscience you're more likely to get a job, I suspect.</p>

<p>Getting a PhD in neuroscience is an interesting suggestion. My concern would be that I'd be much more interested in learning and exploring math than running test participants in lab experiments. But my brother is a neuroscience graduate student, so I will ask if he thinks there's a way for me to fit in. On the whole, I prefer abstraction, but it's definitely work exploring. </p>
<p>Thank you for the recommendations! I'll ask my brother about Kathryn Hess and reach out to Jules Hedges.</p>

<p>If your main desire right now is to learn lots of math then a math PhD is the way to do that.   Working on neuroscience with Kathryn Hess would probably be interesting if you can manage it, since she's a mathematician with lots of neuroscience collaborators, so you might get a math PhD but do work connected to neuroscience.  But a European graduate program is very different than a US one: my impression is that you have to hit the ground running, not spend your first two years taking courses like grad students do in the US.</p>

<p>Thanks! I've seen Toby Smithe's thesis, it's very impressive. As far as economics goes, I'm specifically interested in using category theory to better understand the subject of externality, which would fall into microeconomics.

<p>Hi folks! My name is Ben, I’m a current senior math (&amp; environmental studies) major at St. Olaf College. At the moment, I’m waiting to hear back from a few PhD programs in math I’m waitlisted at, hoping to get some good news soon.</p>
<p>I’ve been interested in category theory for a little while now, and have been actively digging into it to try to learn more for the past year. I found myself in a weird spot as a math &amp; ES major interested specifically in abstract algebra/topology— I had no idea how I was going to bridge the gap in my interests and apply abstract math to environmental issues. I ended up stumbling into categorical systems theory about a year ago, though, and that changed a whole lot!</p>
<p>Since then, I’ve been trying to absorb as much category theory as I can outside my coursework. My interests have shifted a little bit away from applied category theory toward higher categories/categorical logic as of recently, but I still love thinking about compositional systems &amp; games!</p>
<p>At the moment, I’m working on-and-off on a hobby project to “internalize Minesweeper and related puzzles” in the language of category theory, and use fixed points/coalgebras of certain endofunctors to study the various levels of “solvability” that a Minesweeper board (or other puzzle, like a Sudoku board or a jigsaw puzzle) can have. I’m pretty close to something really neat, I think, but I also need time to flesh out how exactly I want to organize all the work I’ve done and communicate it to others.</p>
<p>The past couple days, I’ve also been messing around with the idea of using nonstandard-shaped globe categories to define nonstandard higher categories. More specifically, instead of just using finite ordinals/omega to shape a globe category, maybe we could also use larger ordinals or non-totally-ordered well-partial-orders. I would like to figure out exactly which well-partial-orders P admit reasonably-shaped globe categories (if it isn’t just all of them), then take models of those globe categories in Set to make P-graphs. Then, I’d like to construct a monad on the category of those P-graphs that gives the free weak P-category’s underlying P-graph on any given P-graph, and finally look at its algebras. Long term goal is to get to the functoriality of this construction over the category of well-partial-orders and monotone maps between them, and take some sort of Grothendieck construction to be able to talk about functors between differently-shaped P-categories.</p>
<p>That was a lot— got carried away! Wrapping up, I’m happy to be here and I’m looking forward to sharing thoughts &amp; learning more from everyone. Take care!</p>

<p>Realized I never introduced myself. Hi! I’m Evan, a current PhD student in the philosophy department at UC Berkeley. Before that, I majored in math at Princeton. I consider myself equal parts logician, philosopher, and mathematician. I’m interested in applying formal tools like logic and category theory to enrich and better inform the models and reasoning invoked in philosophy in general and in particular in philosophy of language, epistemology, and philosophy of science. </p>
<p>One interesting project I was involved in as an undergrad can be seen in my thesis advisor’s book, The Logic in Philosophy of Science by Hans Halvorson. My contribution was a proof that a syntactic version of Morita equivalence for first-order theories corresponded to a kind of intertranslatability (see Chapter 7!)</p>
<p>What I’ve worked on recently which may be of interest: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>expanding Abramsky’s category-theoretic version of Arrow’s impossibility theorem to cover other aggregation problems like judgment aggregation, topological social choice theory and credence aggregation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using groupoids to formalize some of the ways philosophers have employed symmetries in their arguments about the nature of spacetime (substantivalism vs relationalism) and mental content (internalism vs externalism)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Hello! I've been lurking for a while, but figured I'd officially join. I am a PhD student in Operations Research, which is an almost entirely applied field. My interest in category theory began informally years ago as a philosophical topic related to complex systems, but only became an earnest effort at formal understanding about a year ago. I exist in a category theory vacuum here, so it's largely a solo effort, and often feels overwhelming. I'd say my level of understanding is medium: I know the basics and have delved into the monoidal category/string diagram world pretty heavily. My formal math background includes exposure to real and complex analysis, linear algebra, abstract algebra, graph theory. </p>
<p>I'm specifically interested in applications of category theory to general optimization duality theory (I've at least reviewed the works of Willerton and Fujii), applications to dealing with large optimization problems, and perhaps as a way of augmenting known relations between group theory and integer programming. In short, I'm really trying to think of ways to truly apply CT in my domain, sort out my half-baked ideas, and press forward.</p>
<p>Any advice or further leads are greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>Wow, I'm so glad that you find it interesting. The short answer is that geometricaly the descent monad (obtained form the pulllback-existencial  adjunction)  is always a Hopf monad with respect to the cartesian monoidal structure. <br>
In a sense, Hopf monads are the groupoids on monoidal (not even braided) categories, and augmented Hopf monads the groups.</p>
<p>On written there's a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04132">pre-print which still needs some love</a> and my <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/1992/62961">thesis</a>.

<p>Right; I was mainly using the article to point out various ideas and conditions that tend to show up when we build monads from fibrations, like the Beck-Chevalley condition.  But it sounds like you don't use that fancier stuff.</p>

<p>In particular I had thought a 'Hopf monad'  was a monad and comonad that fit together in a way similar to how a 'Hopf algebra' is an algebra and coalgebra where the algebra operations are coalgebra morphisms and there's an antipode.</p>

<p>But I already noticed this was probably wrong - and now it's even clearer: for you a 'Hopf monad' is a monad on a monoidal category where the monad structure gets along with the monoidal structure in some way.</p>

<p>The idea behind Hopf monad definition is that the algebra structure is with respect to functor composition, therefore it's a monad; and the co-algebra structure is with respect to the monoidal product, therefore its a (lax) opmonoidal functor. The compatibility of both structures means that the multiplication and unit are opmonoidal natural transformations. The only dificult ingredient was finding that the antipode is a property and not a structure, a property captured by the invertibility of the fusion.</p>

<p>Nice!  I'd like to read the section of your thesis where you use this to prove things about the Galois theory of fields.  (I'm trying to learn more algebraic geometry and number theory.)</p>

<p>Hello, I'm a Ph.D. dropout, working in the industrial ranks, but a lot of my free time is spent going down nLab rabbit holes. My graduate research was focused on analogues of "smoothness" in discrete manifolds. Currently, I am working through MacLane as well as trying to figure out the intuition behind the delooping of an object.</p>
<p>That said, what pushed me over to actually joining this server is a particular question! I'm reading Baez's 2011 "Division Algebras and Quantum Theory", but the nLab page on Hilbert Space links to an MO post which appears to demonstrate that Hilbert spaces can only ever be real or complex: <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3625943/can-hilbert-spaces-be-defined-over-fields-other-than-mathbb-r-and-mathbb-c/4184099#4184099">https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3625943/can-hilbert-spaces-be-defined-over-fields-other-than-mathbb-r-and-mathbb-c/4184099#4184099</a>. So, I'm wondering what I'm missing. The Baez paper describes K-Hilbert spaces over some normed division algebra K, but the positive definiteness of the inner product uses some mysterious order structure on K that I can't quite figure out. The MO post seems to more carefully worry about this order, but then the conclusion seems to be that quaternionic Hilbert spaces don't exist! What's going on here?</p>
<p>Anyway, apart from the above naïve question, my more general hope is that this chat will seduce me into interesting situations with lots of neat people and beautiful math.</p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I'm currently an undergraduate in college, and I'm interested in type theory and related areas.</p>
<p>I haven't a clue how to use any form of social media, so I'm a bit nervous about signing up to this Zulip server. But I'm tired of not having anyone to talk to.</p>

<p>I'm attracted to the vocabulary &amp; concepts of CT in part of by my interest in:<br>
(a) the others it attracts e.g. I know @Andrius Kulikauskas PhD through Math 4 Wisdom (M4W), one of my guides and <br>
(b) my focus on "hypertoons" which feature morphing (shape-changing) scenarios interconnecting key frames or segues, leading to random movies in a hybrid geometric + real world space. I come from a background in philosophy of mathematics.<br>
(c) my focus on "quadrays", a vector space defined by four basis vectors (1,0,0,0) (0,1,0,0) (0,0,1,0) (0,0,0,1), the four corners of a regular tetrahedron, from the center-origin (0,0,0,0) -- how to formally map that to ordinary XYZ vector space in CT language, in terms of isomorphisms etc.</p>

<p>Intro:<br>
I am a fresh beginner to category theory but I’d love to learn by discussion alongside just reading. It really helps me learn that way. If anyone wants to answer my extremely beginners-level questions, I would really appreciate that. Thanks very much.</p>
<p>Here are some, for example.</p>
<p>What is a natural transformation?</p>
<p>What is a finitely presented functor?</p>
<p>One often is told to read a textbook, but I strongly prefer to have support via discussion, especially when I am new to a topic. I know I can look up these definitions, but I want to be able to ask intuitively and straightforwardly to make sure I really get it. Is there a best sub-channel here in Zulip for me? I’ll post my current understanding of the above two questions in a little bit. Thank you.</p>

<p>Welcome Julius, the default stream for asking most questions is <a class="stream" data-stream-id="229199" href="/#narrow/stream/229199-learning.3A-questions">#learning: questions</a> (a moderator could move your questions to a new topic there). Small advice, the first two questions in your intro message are not very prone to enlightening discussions here because we do not know what you already know, so we could give many examples or the precise definitions, but these are already in textbooks, nlab, blogposts, etc. Your later questions with some more detail on your current understanding are way better.</p>

<p>Please note that this is my 2nd introduction in this forum, as my first introduction was as a 2nd year PhD student, which was 3 years back. The following is my current academic situation.</p>
<p>Hi! it's Adittya. I am currently writing my PhD thesis in Higher Gauge theory at IISER-TVM, India. <br>
My thesis introduces a notion of categorified principal 2-bundle that lives in the realm of Lie groupoids. This thesis investigates some geometric relationships between certain standard notions in classical gauge theory and the theory of fibrations/fibered categories by studying connection structures, gauge transformations, and the parallel transport in these principal 2-bundles over Lie groupoids.</p>

More to come!!</p>
<p>Higher geometry, in particular higher differential geometry fascinates me. Recently, I also got interested in Applied Category Theory and would love to see some interaction between them in future.</p>
<p>Also, I am looking for "Post-doctoral positions in related fields", as I will be submitting my PhD thesis in a month. So, please let me know, if any such positions are available.</p>

<p>Hi, my name is John Onstead. I am currently a student interested in learning category theory. I was recommended here by Dr. Shulman, whom I had the pleasure of meeting with the other day! My main reason for learning category theory is that I am currently working on a category theory pedagogy project with many unique twists, whose aim it is to introduce category theory to undergraduates (perhaps ambitiously to be able to introduce it to first or second year undergrads!) It will not be for a long time that I can finish due to slow progress (it took months for me to finally sort of understand the basic machinery of category theory, which is essentially still where I am now), but in the meantime I will try to read some of the posts on here and maybe learn something new!</p>

<p>Welcome, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="673117">@John Onstead</span> ! The pedagogy project you describe sounds quite interesting! It's a bit different, but sometimes I reflect that the mathematical structures introduced relatively early on in education (for example in high school) are surprisingly complex. For example, a great deal of focus is placed on the real numbers, and the real numbers have a lot of structure! (In the setting of the real numbers we have an ordering, we can add and subtract, multiply and divide, and we can talk about limits of sequences.) By contrast, the concept of a category seems simpler in some ways (at least to me). So sometimes I wonder if it could be helpful to introduce arguably simpler things like monoids and preorders (and maybe even categories) before focusing so much on the real numbers!</p>
<p>Anyways, welcome again to the zulip!</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277503">@David Egolf</span> You're very right! Learning category theory has actually given be a much different perspective on mathematical objects than I had before. It allowed me to realize certain mathematical objects are not made of one cohesive structure, but can be represented as continuously building up more and more structure onto something. For instance, the real numbers as you describe, seem like a logical conclusion if you are building up from natural numbers using recursion (IE, from something like the Peano axioms). However, in category theory, that same construction is some underlying set (the set of real numbers) plus the structure of a topological space (the real line) plus the structure of an ordering/poset (where one number is "less than" another number) plus the structure of a field (to add, multiply, subtract, and divide). Euclidean space is another one of these, where one has an underlying set of points (underlying set) PLUS a topology (topological space) PLUS a metric (metric space) PLUS a differentiable structure (smooth manifold) PLUS measures (measureable space) PLUS a way of assigning vectors (vector space) and so on. Decomposing Euclidean spaces in this way really put things into perspective for me of how this seemingly natural structure, where deciding to do various things within it seemed natural and intuitive, was in fact some crazy mathematical convergence of all these concepts.<br>
Also, I've read some of your questions, they're quite similar to ones I have, so I look forward to reading more of them!</p>

<p>That's a great explanation <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="673117">@John Onstead</span>! It's interesting how certain mathematical structures can feel basic and intuitive, and simultaneously be a "crazy mathematical convergence" of a plethora of concepts.</p>
<p>It's great to hear that you're looking forward to more of my questions! (I don't seem to be running out any time soon, so I'm sure there will be more to come...) But also -  if you have similar questions, and you feel inspired to discuss them, please consider posting them on this zulip! I hope you'll find it can be quite fun and educational to do so. In general, I think a variety of questions at a variety of levels is part of what can help keep this community healthy and active.</p>

<p>Hello! <br>
My name is Adam and I am a lover of logic, tentatively returning to the world of category theory. </p>
<p>I came to the world of pure mathematics via philosophy. I did my undergrad at Princeton 2011-2015, where I worked with Hans Halvorson, who works on category theory applications to logic and the philosophy of science. <br>
I took courses like Formal Logic,  Mathematical Logic, Philosophical Logic, and Set Theory. <br>
I fell in love with the methods and subject matter of mathematical logic. </p>
<p>It was empowering for me to learn that a great deal of mathematics can be understood in terms of formal definitions and which statements entail others. An 'intuition' or ability to 'visualize,' while often useful, was not <em>necessary.</em> <br>
One can construct a rigorous and accurate proof using only an understanding of the logical structure of definitions and theorems. One can engage 'semantically;' What is true? or 'syntactically;' What can I derive? <br>
AND the two perspectives are connected. <br>
This ‘logical’ perspective allowed me to be successful in standard mathematics courses like Real Analysis, Topology, and Graph Theory, beyond the world of logic and foundations. </p>
<p>I was encouraged by Hans to take his course in category theory for undergraduates. <br>
I was further enticed by the promise that recent work in logic used categorical methods, and that category theory was proposed as an alternative foundation by philosophers of mathematics. </p>
<p>It is a bit bizarre because I entered this course (as well as later pure math courses) with really only a logician's perspective; category theory was another formal theory that could be investigated, so I learned 'synthetic' category theory only, before encountering, say, abstract or linear algebra. <br>
I first heard the words 'group' and 'homomorphism' and 'vector space' in this course, as examples of concrete categories.<br>
I wrote a senior (philosophy) thesis on structuralist philosophy of mathematics. </p>
<p>From 2017-2019 I was a master's student at Carnegie Mellon University, mostly because I was enticed by the work there in homotopy type theory and proof assistants. I took courses on proof theory, automated theorem proving in LEAN, and synthetic homotopy theory. <br>
At CMU I tried to contribute to the program on HoTT, with the help of people like Jonas Frey. <br>
Without much experience with independent research in mathematics, I was not able to successfully complete a master's thesis. </p>
<p>At the moment I am working as an adjunct lecturer at a small engineering school in Boston, where I teach courses in Discrete Math. I enjoy the opportunity to show the virtues of the logical perspective of mathematics to aspiring engineers and programmers. <br>
I can expound at length about the general idea of category theory, but am hopelessly rusty when it comes to actually proving/computing results about it. My hope in joining this community is to have resources and motivation for self-study. </p>
<p>Generally my research interests are epistemic and methodological questions surrounding the practice of pure mathematics. <br>
What is the epistemic role of a proof? <br>
What is the value of 'purely syntactic' reasoning? <br>
When are two formal theories 'equivalent?' <br>
What do we really accomplish when we establish a soundness/completeness result for a formal theory? </p>
<p>I do not know if I plan to pursue further academic research in these areas, but I know that questions like these excite me, as does the ability to address them using formal tools. </p>
<p>Many years ago, I was told that universal and existential quantification can be understood in terms of an adjunction, and for now, understanding that adjunction is my concrete goal. </p>
<p>... I realize my post here is longer than I intended... and despite some attempts to truncate it, I have decided to publish it at it's current length!</p>

With regard to the interaction of formal proof with present-day insights of category theory, I want to highlight Andrej Bauer's <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/a/130125/2926">excellent reply</a>, emphasizing that proofs can be regarded as genuine mathematical objects, no less than numbers are mathematical objects.</p>

<p>His concluding paragraph: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because mathematicians have not reached the level of reflection which would allow them to accept proof relevant mathematics they seek security in the mathematically and socially inadequate dogma that a proof can only be a finite syntactic entity. This makes us feeble and weak and unable to argue intelligently with a well-versed sociologist who can wield the weapons of social theories, anthropology and experimental psychology. So the best answer to the question "is rigor just a ritual" is to study rigor as a mathematical concept, to quantify it, to abstract it, and to turn it into something new, flexible and beautiful. Then we will laugh at our old fears, wonder how we ever could have thought that rigor is absolute, and we will become the teachers of our critics.</p>

<p>Interesting indeed, thanks Todd. It's nice to see <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="344629">@Andrej Bauer</span> emphasise the importance of reconciling truth and explanation in proof theory. Something that puzzles me is his questioning of the “dogma” that proofs can only be finite syntactic entities. Although proofs have models in semantic categories like infinite-categories, I don't think I've ever seen them defined in a non-syntax-like way. Do you fully understand what he means?</p>

<p>Yes, a few years ago someone decided to put the word "pseudoscience" into the socionics wikipedia article (and wikipedia is never wrong, right?). Whether it is or is not is a discussion we can have, in fact I am working on an article explaining the verification status of socionics that will hopefully clear things up. But in any case, socionics has nontrivial mathematical content regardless of whether it is empirically verified, much like other topics like string theory.</p>

<p>Hi ! I'm a PhD student from Paris, in model theory of valued fields (a mix of algebra and mathematical logic). I discovered category theory 6 years ago, always found it interesting. Until recently, I wasn't aware of all the potential applications (outside of pure maths, I mean) ! <br>
I would like to work in that field in the future; I am currently learning about categorical systems theory.</p>

<p>Hi ! I'm Gregory Chichery, PhD student at Marseille. My subject is semantics of circular proof so I investigate lot of questions about monoidal closed, star-autonomous categories, (co)algebras and recently I am interested about enriched categories.<br>
Looking forward to talking with you !</p>

<p>Hello! I am Roy and I am busy with my PhD at Stellenbosch University in South Africa. I am very excited to meet and learn from members of the community!</p>
<p>I'm primarily studying extensivity/distributivity in a monoidal setting. I'm also looking at a Grothendieck fibrations approach to Grothendieck topologies. I am currently introducing myself to topos theory, type theory, fibred category theory, categorical logic, and boolean categories. More broadly I'd like to learn about the different approaches to formal semantics of programming languages and possible connections between these and what I do. I like computers <span aria-label="robot" class="emoji emoji-1f916" role="img" title="robot">:robot:</span> </p>
<p>All in all, I am very happy to be studying category theory since it feels like it equips you with a toolbox that is useful in many other areas.</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Sascha. I am a master student in physics, just starting my research about the description of measurement and decoherence in quantum theory by  categorical / graphical  symplectic algebra.</p>
<p>I'm also interested in philosophy, especially the philosophy of physics and in quantum logic and it's categorical representations.</p>
<p>Another side interest of mine is how to tackle the climate crisis and how math, science and philosophy can contribute to this extraordinarily important task.</p>

<p>If you are interested in the applications of category theory to quantum mechanics in general, there are different approaches: One ist to look at the <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">†</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\dag</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8889em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord">†</span></span></span></span>-compact category <strong>Hilb</strong> (<strong>FHilb</strong>) of (finite dimensional) Hilbert spaces, with the monoidal product given by the tensor product. This is the program of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_quantum_mechanics">categorical quantum mechanics</a> (see also <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/quantum+information+theory+via+dagger-compact+categories">here</a>).</p>
<p>Another approach is so called "topos quantum theory" where one looks at the category of presheaves on the C*-algebra or von Neumann algebras of operators on a given Hilbert space, <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Bohr+topos">which form a topos</a>.  </p>
<p>(I hope I got this right, I am not an expert on any of this.)</p>
<p>My project, which i am just starting with, is about yet another approach, probably more closely related to the former of the above mentioned approaches. The idea is to use subcategories of <strong>Rel</strong>, along the lines of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07914">this paper</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking about <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/quantum+logic">quantum logic</a>, there are different approaches as well. The main difference is that, coming from classical (boolean) logic, you either drop distributivity or  the law of excluded middle (lem).<br>
 Dropping distributivity leads to what is traditionally known as "quantum logic" and goes back to Birkhoff and von Neumann (1936). This version of quantum logic is more closely related to (monoidal) categorical quantum mechanics.<br>
Another approach is to use the internal logic of the aforementioned Bohr topos, which is a Heyting algebra and therefore is distributive, but lem does not hold in this logical system.</p>

<p>Thanks for the introduction I'll have to check out all those sources. It seems the first way presented of doing QM in CT is just the direct way- to do the usual Hilbert space formulation of QM, but just in the categorical setting of the category of Hilbert Spaces. But the interesting thing here is that many phenomena of QM seem to remain even when you abstract away to the more general setting of dagger compact categories. The other ways seem to leverage the notion of categories, especially toposes, having an "internal language" or "internal logic" to encapsulate stuff about quantum mechanics. </p>
<p>I look forward to learning more about this, it sounds fascinating!</p>

I'm definitely in a place where all kinds of math interests me (coming from a small liberal arts college, being at a big research institution in a university town is like a "mathematical candy store" in the words of one of my professors), but I guess right now I'm most likely to go into algebraic topology or categorical logic.

<p>Hi!  I could be wrong, but I feel the category theorists most involved in artificial intelligence don't post here very much, at least not now. </p>
<p>For example, check out <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276875">@Bruno Gavranović</span>'s webpage:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.brunogavranovic.com/">https://www.brunogavranovic.com/</a></p>
<p>He has studied <a href="https://categoricaldeeplearning.com/">categorical deep learning</a>, and he's now working for <a href="https://www.maginative.com/article/symbolica-raises-31m-to-redesign-ai-with-structured-reasoning/">Symbolica</a>, a company that's trying to apply category theory (or more generally "structured reasoning") to AI.   Dominic Verity is another category theorist who works there.</p>
<p>Second, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="282874">@davidad (David Dalrymple)</span> seems to be running a program on "safeguarded AI" out the UK agency ARIA - the Advanced Research + Invention agency - and he is very interested in using category theory for this purpose.  You can see a bit about davidad here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidad/?originalSubdomain=uk">https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidad/?originalSubdomain=uk</a></p>
<p>This program is funding a new branch of the Topos Institute in the UK, and some category theorists I know who'll be working there include <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276589">@Sophie Libkind</span>, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="751249">@David Jaz Myers</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="280755">@Owen Lynch</span>.    They are planning to use double categories.</p>
<p>Third, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="299060">@Tai-Danae Bradley</span> is working with various collaborators at <a href="https://pub.sandboxaq.com/publications/the-structure-of-meaning-in-language-parallel-narratives-in-linear-algebra-and-category-theory">SandboxAQ</a> to apply category theory (and other mathematics) to machine learning:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.math3ma.com/about">https://www.math3ma.com/about</a></p>
<p>But one thing all these people have in common is that they don't spend much time here!   I'm not sure why: maybe it's because they're too busy.   It's too bad, actually.</p>
<p>So, I didn't answer your question at all - I just pointed you to some people who might have interesting answers.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span> Hey thanks for the response! Those are incredible recommendations. I have been following Topos Institute and Symbolica, but hadn't discovered ARIA or the other ones.</p>
<p>It's interesting that ARIA plans to use double categories. I know they aren't the same thing, but I saw Symbolica is considering using 2-categories somehow <a href="https://icml.cc/virtual/2024/poster/34589">https://icml.cc/virtual/2024/poster/34589</a>. Lots of exciting stuff to learn!</p>

<p>I hadn't seen that paper, though, so thanks!  </p>
<p>2-categories and double categories are very generic tools in category theory, so one can't really draw much of a conclusion when someone says they are using them.  It's sort of like if a physicist says she's using differential equations. </p>
<p>I somewhat understand the double category work being done by Sophie Libkind, David Jaz-Myers and Owen Lynch since I've been involved in that general kind of work: the basic idea is to think of an open system as a "loose morphism" in a double category, and a map between open systems as a "2-morphism".   David has been writing a book on this, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05956">here is an abstract</a>.   I have written an endless stream of papers on examples of this philosophy.</p>
<p>Gavranovic and company are doing something else, and I don't know how it's related.</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span> (and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="870622">@Kawin Nikomborirak</span> ),</p>
<p>Thanks for the shoutout.  I've indeed been quite busy lately, and haven't found the necessary bandwidth to engage with all the exciting content that's being posted here on Zulip.</p>
<p>I just want to add a correction here: I am not employed by nor affiliated with Symbolica in any way anymore, nor do I endorse any research they claim to be doing. I was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7273698639749804032/">fired in</a> December without any warning and escorted out of the office on the spot. Many other people have also been fired, or resigned voluntarily. Dominic Verity is one of them, Neil Ghani another. But this isn't limited to just category theorists - this holds for many competent ML researchers too. There's <a href="https://x.com/IntuitMachine/status/1869062676422496326">much more to say</a>, but I was threatened legal action for talking about it publicly. So if you want to know more, feel free to reach out via DMs.</p>
<p>These terrible news aside, the work on CT + AI is still going strong, if not stronger than before. I might add to John's list <a href="https://cybercat.institute//">CyberCat institute</a> which has, among other things, done some exciting work on reinforcement learning (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02688">Reinforcement Learning in Categorical Cybernetics</a> or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04547">Value iteration is Optic Composiiton</a>) showing a deep relationship to the same kinds of gadgets we used to model deep learning: optics and lenses.</p>
<p>Another one is <a href="https://hellas.ai/">Hellas.ai</a> (which I now see has an updated landing page with much less info than there was last time I checked... <span aria-label="sweat smile" class="emoji emoji-1f605" role="img" title="sweat smile">:sweat_smile:</span>) led by my collaborator <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="281134">@Paul Wilson</span> on the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01931">Categorical Foundations of Gradient-Based Learning</a>.

<p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>I'm Pablo Donato, a computer scientist and currently a postdoc with Olivia Caramello at the Grothendieck Institute, working on the formalization of topos theory in Lean. My <a href="https://theses.hal.science/tel-04698985">PhD thesis</a> was about the design of gestural user interfaces for interactive theorem provers, with ideas inspired from a branch of (structural) proof theory called <a href="http://boole.stanford.edu/~dominic/papers/di/di.pdf">deep inference</a>.</p>
<p>I am really an amateur in category theory, but I am very interested in all lines of work studying <em>graphical calculi</em> or string diagrams, especially when it is strongly tied to logic as in the work on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07055">Diagrammatic Algebra for First-Order Logic</a>. As a matter of fact, some people here may have heard of my <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15174">Flower Calculus</a>, which can be seen as an intuitionistic (and stringless) variant of the previous work, also inspired by C. S. Peirce's existential graphs.</p>
<p>I'll stop the intro here, looking forward to interesting discussions with the category theory folks here!</p>

<p>Hi Pierre,</p>
<p>Thank you for the kind words. I'm really glad you found the course useful!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, at the moment there are no plans to organise a second edition, but I'm sure we'll do something similar, <em>at some point</em>. (We've all been busy with doing research on categorical AI, and it would definitely make a lot sense to share and pedagogically explain all of the new things we've done.)</p>
<p>Until then, maybe it makes sense to point you to the <a href="https://github.com/bgavran/Category_Theory_Resources">list of pedagogical resources for learning CT</a> that I'm curating. A lot of the ideas we use in categorical AI are really shared with other parts of CT - this is what makes it useful, and powerful!

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I am a master's student at Minnesota (UMN) enamoured by category theory and its applications to systems, networks, data, and ML (or formal verification thereof).  I am grateful to have found this Zulip and, within it, such a thriving and diverse community.</p>
<p>I am looking for employment in ACT, formal verification, or technical writing on these subjects. If anyone would like to steer me towards a particular company or individual, I would greatly appreciate the support. For more details on myself, see my <a href="https://monte-mahlum.github.io/">website</a>.</p>

<p>Hi everybody! My name's Olga. I've been interested in mathematics for a long time, but haven't had an opportunity to seriously study it until relatively recently.</p>
<p>My interest in category theory stems in part from my background as a programmer. It started with a frustration with the limitations of Python's type system, which led me to learn about dependent types, and soon after I picked up the basics of Agda and later some Haskell. From there, I became interested in the Curry-Howard correspondence and how it connects to category theory. Learning about products and coproducts from the categorical perspective really solidified my interest.</p>
<p>Right now, I'm focused on picking up the general background mathematics, as well as slowly learning things that I find interesting for whatever reason. Learning mathematics alone is not that great, so I've been trying to interact more with other mathematically inclined people. I'm looking forward to learning alongside you all.</p>

<p>Hi, everybody! I'm Elizabeth Dwyer, a 26 year old American software developer. In my free time, I'm interested in learning about programming languages, programming language design, and type theory. My interest in category theory comes from the relations it has to type theory and whatever applications to programming languages.</p>

<p>Hi, I’m <a href="https://bersier.github.io">Stephane</a>. I’ve worked as a software and ML engineer, and in recent years I’ve been prioritizing some independent projects—though slower than I’d like, in part due to isolation and chronic health issues. I'm hoping to meet people who’ll challenge and expand my thinking.</p>
<p>A self-described tectophile, my interests span</p>
<ul>
<li>computer science, math, and physics</li>
<li>complex systems (thermodynamics, emergence, universality)</li>
<li>abstract structure design (modeling, abstraction, typeful programming)</li>
<li>decentralization, interaction and game theory</li>
</ul>
<p>What drives me is doing things properly: first‑principles, theory‑grounded work that cuts through artificial trade‑offs. I’m very much a category theory novice, but I’d love to get better, and to learn from people here.</p>
<p>I co-authored <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11776">Encoding Architecture Algebra</a>, mapping algebraic data types onto neural network architectures—perhaps trivial from a CT perspective, while too abstract for mainstream ML. I’d welcome any thoughts.</p>
<p>Most of all, I’d like to form real connections, so if you’re up for deeper one‑on‑one chats, sharing, collaboration, or simply mutual support, please reach out!</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277473">@Morgan Rogers (he/him)</span>!  I guess a <strong>tectophile</strong> (a term I just made up) is someone who can't resist poking beneath the surface, always chasing cleaner abstractions, tidier models, and structures that feel <em>right</em>. Whether in math, code, or abstract ideas, they love capturing the essence underlying things—or creating new elegant structures. They live for that moment when a representation feels <em>inevitable</em>.</p>

<p>Hello, my name is Ruby! I'm currently doing a PhD in condensed matter physics, but fell in love with category theory during my masters. It was a pleasant surprise to learn it actually gets used within my field! Somehow, the way of thinking within category theory feels very familiar to me as a physicist...</p>
<p>I'm a physicist at heart, not a mathematician, but there's still plenty of pure math I find "pretty" - calculus and linear algebra are some of my favorites. Condensed matter's my jam, but I love all kinds of physics, whether it's statphys or general relativity or quantum field theory or Hamiltonian mechanics or good ol' Newton's laws. And astrophysics! I just really like math and science :D</p>
<p>Recently I've been interested in learning some higher category theory, especially since I've heard it's relevant for stuff like topological quantum field theories or generalised symmetries. Dealing with the coherence conditions has been a bit of a nightmare, though, so I'm trying to figure out if there's a sensible model of (infty, infty) category (and functors etc). Once I get that, in principle I can just truncate :).</p>
<p>Looking forward to discussing some cat theory! Apologies in advance for my relative lack of mathematical knowledge, and my bias towards informal arguments over formal proofs~</p>

<p>Do you have an advisor?  They're supposed to help you figure out what to work on.  If you don't have an advisor who knows about applications of category theory to physics, you should probably wait until after you get your PhD to work on that.  The great thing about grad school is that you can acquire the skills your advisor happens to have.</p>

<p>Ah yes I have an advisor, I've been working on a research project they've suggested since the start of my PhD. Not directly related to category theory but still very cool physics! And yeah, the category theory definitely has been a (recent) distraction from the PhD for me, but I am making sure I stay on track. Thanks for your well-wishes :)</p>

<p>Hi all, my name is Corentin Briat and I am currently a Scientist and Lecturer in the school of life sciences of the university of applied sciences in Switzerland. Even though I am associated with life sciences, my background is in engineering, systems and control theory, dynamical systems, and optimization with applications to complex systems and networks. I have worked in communication networks (as postdoc at KTH, Stockholm, Sweden) as well as systems and synthetic biology, especially through reaction networks theory (as senior scientist at ETH-Zurich until now). </p>
<p>I have now started looking into category theory as I believe it can provide a tool for the representation of complex systems/networks and their architecture. I am at the very beginning at the moment but I am interested in merging dynamical systems, control theory, optimization, and category theory. </p>
<p>Looking forward to having discussions about this here :)</p>

<p>I'm Christopher Townsend - new to this forum, but long time Locale Theorist (if there is such a thing!). My papers are (mostly) on <a href="http://christophertownsend.org">christophertownsend.org</a> if you'd like context for my work. My focus is on the power locales and how we can use them to give a purely locale theory based approach to topos theory. The idea is that the true 'object of study' is a category of locales (suitably axiomatised ...) rather than  an elementary topos, so that the toposes are 'just' the discrete objects. For example we can represent geometric morphisms as adjunctions between categories  of locales and can see the hyperconnected localic factorisation as a relatively trivial categorical construction when viewed in this way.</p>

<p>Thanks! I didn't know about this characterisation of geometric morphisms using Frobeniusness. On related note, in quantale theory, people seem to prefer internal suplattices instead of internal discrete locales.</p>

<p>Hello there, my name is Kasra, I just joined this forum, and I'm a bachelors student of Mathematics at Freie Universität in Berlin, Germany, currently writing my bachelors thesis on the topic of concrete dualities. </p>
<p>I have been studying category theory for 1 year now; this time last year I started a course in topos theory and since then it has been the central language of another course I have taken Algebra II (which was this functorial perspective of scheme theory/algebraic geometry) and it is central to my thesis topic as well.</p>
<p>I really appreciate this way of thinking, and as I get closer to the submission of my thesis, I become more curious about where I could take this knowledge. So, I would like to learn more and stay connected.</p>

<p>Hello there, my name is Kasra, I just joined this forum, and I'm a bachelors student of Mathematics at Freie Universität in Berlin, Germany, currently writing my bachelors thesis on the topic of concrete dualities. </p>
<p>I have been studying category theory for 1 year now; this time last year I started a course in topos theory and since then it has been the central language of another course I have taken Algebra II (which was this functorial perspective of scheme theory/algebraic geometry) and it is central to my thesis topic as well.</p>
<p>I really appreciate this way of thinking, and as I get closer to the submission of my thesis, I become more curious about where I could take this knowledge. So, I would like to learn more and stay connected.</p>

<p>Concrete dualities are an interesting topic.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276422">@David Michael Roberts</span>  --- indeed. --- torsors/principal bundles over (the core of a)  localic category. It was all working out well, until I realised I needed to know something about the classifying localic category (not just groupoid ...) of a geometric theory. This has led me to spend ages on the Vietoris construction so have not finished on the work we were talking about.</p>

<p>Hello everyone, I am Jay. I am a Maths undergraduate who wants to "do Category Theory" for their project.  I've been given a few books to go through by my supervisor such as "Seven Sketches in Compositionality" and "Basic Category Theory by Tom Leinster" (This is the main one I am reading, I am just over a quarter of the way through it about to move onto Chapter 3) but I am finding it hard to follow some of the examples with my limited knowledge on Topology. I am going to learn some Topology this year in my degree but I don't want to leave my project until then to start. Are there any specific parts of Topology I should focus on if I plan to do my project on Category Theory? Through perusing Wikipedia, I see it becomes a lot more important if I want to learn about Higher Category Theory, which I think I do.</p>
<p>Also, if you would recommend any other books or other resources for learning about Category Theory feel free to share them with me (I have found a few YouTube channels with folders on Category Theory as well as the Reddit page, which lead me here, not that I understand a lot of it YET). At the moment I am just trying to learn as much as I can about Category Theory before picking a specific thing for my project.</p>
<p>Thanks for anything :)</p>

<p>You'll be one of relatively few people so far who have learned topology <em>along with</em> category theory, instead of the more common thing of first learning topology, then learning category theory and seeing that topology gives lots of great examples of category-theoretic concepts.</p>

<p>I'm one of the people who (somehow, even after starting with Riehl) is learning topology very much after category theory, and it seems way harder than the alternative lol. It seems like it could be a good path in theory but afaict, there's no monolithic resource for it like ex. Sheaves in Geometry and Logic is for the normal way.</p>

<p>Also, hi!</p>
<p>I'm an undergrad interested in (enriched) category theory especially from an algebraic/logical perspective. My ideal research program would be working with pure category theory to define new math rather than generalize previous theories, and answering questions like "how many ways can some category be concretized". I live near Hopkins/UMBC, and I want to meet more people and get more seriously into research in this Zulip :)</p>

<p>Yes, that book seems like potentially the right way to learn topology <em>while</em> learning category theory, or <em>after</em> learning category theory.   But the right link to that book is this:</p>
<p><a href="https://jterilla.github.io/TopologyBook/">https://jterilla.github.io/TopologyBook/</a></p>

<p>I've recently finished undergrad at Manchester in mathematics, where I primarily studied logic/ML and self studied a lot of CT, however I'm now taking a year out due to disruption throughout my degree, unhappily working in data science. I'm attempting to position myself towards a PhD in ACT, though it's proving difficult as most graduate admissions aren't particularly sensitive to mitigating circumstances! I'm trying to scrape by any research experience I can get, and currently studying Aluffi, Fong &amp; Spivak, and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="751249">@David Jaz Myers</span>'s book along with reading papers, but spare time is limited! I'm rather interested in the general "cybernetics" field, both categorically and historically, along with quantum-related topics which I have too little background in. Hoping to connect with all of you, and keep up to date with events etc, esp. the adjoint school and anyone in need of RAs!</p>
