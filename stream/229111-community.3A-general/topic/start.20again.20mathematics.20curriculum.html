<p>He raises a question mark about teaching more set theory, given some people's bad experiences with the "New Math."  I think set theory is essential, and the main lesson from the New Math is that it's almost impossible for teachers to teach well what they don't understand.  To teach category theory, we need people who understand category theory.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276867">@Daniel Geisler</span> Some little kids ask questions. A "teacher" for little kids ought to learn how to help <em>all</em> little kids ask questions.  Then, pretty much all questions have some mathematical aspect, and a "teacher" ought to know how to make the connection between a little kid's question(s) to some little bits of mathematics. To me, that means *every * "teacher" should be a perpetual student of mathematics. And, of course, everyone ought to be a perpetual student of everything. Life is short.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="319799">@Ellis D. Cooper</span> I believe in a holistic approach to math education - set theory and CT, human and computer instruction. While people have different opinions about the significance of different branches of mathematics, few debate the importance of mathematics itself.   <br>
In third grade I began asking my teachers about the patterns I was seeing in multiplication tables. I developed a good chunk of mathematics before I realized that I had reinvented discrete calculus during an IQ test and was using simultaneous equations to solve chemistry  problems. <br>
While I love mathematics, it is only a hobby, as I work as a computer developer. It is my  hope that soon we will develop AI systems for analysing in detail people's mathematical problem solving ability.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276867">@Daniel Geisler</span> When I was in 6th grade in the early 1950s at PS139 in Brooklyn, NY my wonderful teacher Miss Keit had a guest who asked if anyone could spell "infinitesimal." I did, and (a lot) later I learned Abraham Robinson's explanation.</p>

<p>Eugenia's next book:<br>
x + y<br>
A Mathematician’s Manifesto for Rethinking Gender</p>
<p>"Why are men in charge? After years in the male-dominated field of mathematics and in the female-dominated field of art, Eugenia Cheng has heard the question many times. In x + y, Cheng argues that her mathematical specialty — category theory — reveals why. Category theory deals more with context, relationships, and nuanced versions of equality than with intrinsic characteristics. Category theory also emphasizes dimensionality: much as a cube can cast a square or diamond shadow, depending on your perspective, so too do gender politics appear to change with how we examine them. Because society often rewards traits that it associates with males, such as competitiveness, we treat the problems those traits can create as male. But putting competitive women in charge will leave many unjust relationships in place. If we want real change, we need to transform the contexts in which we all exist, and not simply who we think we are."<br>
