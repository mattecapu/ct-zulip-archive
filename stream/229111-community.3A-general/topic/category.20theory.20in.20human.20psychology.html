<p>I may have said this elsewhere but I think a topic for investigation would be how software professionals have specialised in different categories, and find it difficult to bridge those. E.g. Category of Sets for FP, Coalgebras for OO, Bicategories of relations for Semantic Web, Functors to Set for Relational DBs? Just a thought, that I'd be happy to read a paper on to clarify or even debunk this intuition.</p>

<p>Yes, I've been working on category theory first for electrical circuits and then chemical reactions - these already posed a lot of challenges!  Next I'd like to tackle more biochemistry and evolutionary game theory.  All these are much easier to study mathematically than psychology.  Maybe someone can plunge straight into doing psychology with categories before doing all these "easier" sciences, but only if they know a lot of category theory and have some insight into psychology that lends itself to mathematical formalization.</p>

<p>From our exposure to music we may  assume that  every scale (a sequence of musical notes ) when played in a particular time signature they somehow  expresses a particular human emotion. Though the converse may not be true that is whether every emotion can be expressed through some sequence of musical notes or not. If I assume that the converse is also true then in some sense studying human emotions will be same as studying different scale patterns in music. But I guess that  there are some good work on axiomatising music theory through category theory (for example <em>The Topos of Music</em> <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783764357313">https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783764357313</a>). So in that case can the study of music theory will be considered as a study of human emotions(which is a part of human psychology)?</p>
<p>I apologise priorly if I sound very naive. I am a music enthusiast and play some musical instruments. I always felt the connection of emotion and music. So I am just curious.</p>

<p>I spend a year reading books on psychology around 2001 while in SF, from analytic philosophy to Jung (you can open all kinds of doors and have conversation in SF cafes with a good knowledge of him), to cognitive and existential psychotherapy,  etc... <br>
I think (some) emotions can be modelled in terms of epistemic modal logic: it is a shift in your indexing in the set of possible worlds. So in that logic a belief is a set of possible worlds. You tend to position yourself as inside the worlds you believe to be true.  But new information can shift your understanding of where you are in the space of possibilities. <br>
An example:<br>
   Jane is walking down a dark street going home after a hard days work. She hears footsteps behind her in the distance getting closer. At this point a number of possibilities could start coming up. Perhaps she is worried and so dangerous ones come to mind. Danger would requiring looking around, but that could reveal fear. So she goes on a bit. Her heart beats  faster, she searches for possible escape routes if the worst were to come true. What door could she ring on? As she gets closer to her friends house she ventures to turn her head: it's her brother. Nothing to worry about.  She smiles.<br>
   Facts can change emotions, as they change the space of possibilities in which one places oneself.</p>

<p>Now as I recall this positioning in space is what co-monads do. Every comonad has a co-unit, that extracts the object at that location.</p>

<p>I am not sure how this works in detail, but the relation between monads, comonads and modal logic has been made in quite a number of papers.  In possible worlds logic there is a pointer, the actual world, denoted @, that picks out a world out of the sets of all worlds. (so this works like the counit). That is an indexical, in that for any agent in any world, that world in which that agent is, is the actual one. (It is indexical just like "now" is always the time at which that token is spoken, "I" refers to the person who utters the word, "here" refers to the place of around the person speaking, etc...). One can when reading fiction change (by suspension of disbelief) the world which one considers actual.  See the fun essay <a href="https://andrewmbailey.com/dkl/">Truth in Fiction</a>.</p>
<p>When thinking about psychology one has to take a phenomenological reading of possible worlds, which I think is how one has to read Philip K. Dick, who came up <a href="#narrow/stream/229451-general.3A-off-topic/topic/The.20epistemic.20coup/near/224679879">in a discussion in Febuary</a>.</p>

<p>I'm not very impressed by that book.  I would like to see someone who knows music theory and topos theory, other than the author of that book and his friends and students, say something concrete about what's good about this book.  I know a fair amount of topos theory - not much compared to some people here, but more than what's in this book - and I'm not completely ignorant of mathematical music theory.  But I don't see what that book does that's interesting.</p>

<p>Perhaps this does not come out so well in kripke modal logic. But the truth of a counterfactual statement depends very much on where the actual world is (counterfactuals are a <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/graded+modality">graded modality</a>) So if "If Kangaroos had not tails they would topple over" depends on what the closest world to the actual one is where they have no tails.

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span>  Thank you Sir very much  for the references. Can the mathematical music theory has the potential to understand/explore/ classify  human emotions?  For example one can argue that the same  music may not induce the  same emotional feeling to each person but I feel there is some universality too ( example  major scales create some joyful feel whereas  minor scales create a little darker feel , Different Raagas in Indian Classical music expresses different moods, same is true when we move from one genre, sub genre of music to another). But let's discuss a hypothetical situation(inspired from <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="319282">@Chetan Vuppulury</span> ) say a person travels 100 years back and play hard rock then how would a person in 1921 react to it?<br>
 Generally Hard rock expresses  some extreme aggression, rebel,  Boldness....etc(hard to describe in words). But these feelings were still present  in 1921 population but might not have the right music to express them. It's a kind of similar when Einstein found the use of Riemannian geometry(which were developed much before) useful to describe the universe. But there are also other instances like if someone plays smooth Jazz in saxophone(representing a city life) to a rural population of 1500 AD they may not relate to any of their emotions prevalent in their life. But if the same person from 1500 time travels to 2000 and  leads a city life for some years then he/she may relate something to that music.</p>
<p>Now consider pure Mathematics. It generally explores all the logical structure that can be derived from the fundamental axioms using deductive logic. It generally does not care even if that logical structure fails to prove itself to be  useful to the existing science. But it  may be possible that someone from future can find some usefulness  for that logical structure . </p>
<p>Keeping the discussion for pure Mathematics in mind , can we say that  one can use music theory  to explore/understand all possible human emotions irrespective of the fact that whether <em>a particular human emotion</em>  can relate to some existing set of emotions in the contemporary population or not?</p>

<p>So in your argument you keep moving between the space of all... and the particular. I think we need to model both, which we can do with a simple construct of pointed Xs. <br>
We can have Pointed Sets, which are sets with a point in them. Or pointed graphs, which are pairs of Graphs with and a node in them. So we can have Pointed Spaces with a space and a point in it. (S,a). If x is closer to y in (S,a) this may not be the case in (S,b). <br>
Similarily, the propositions true in (W,a) may not be true in (W,b) (here propositions can be thought geometrically as subspaces of W). <br>
What is true at one time, may not be true at another. The music enjoyed at one period may not be understandable to those living at a previous one. <br>
What you are imagining when you are imagining someone from the past coming to the future, is a morphism from one state to another. Children have to do this all the time, as they learn new concepts, and as their space of possibilities increases from the crib and the mother, to the family, to the village, country, earth, universe, and beyond.  But we also have to do this moment to moment as we shift from one understanding of where in the space of possibilities were are (is it an antilope or a lion over there) to another.</p>

<p>And indeed where we understand ourselves to be in the space of possibilities will inform our actions, since emotions and actions are closely related.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="281126">@Henry Story</span> the actuality operator is part of hybrid logic, an extension of modal logic.

<p>Perhaps this does not come out so well in kripke modal logic.

<p>I think if you want to understand the <em>emotional</em> aspects of music you should look, not at mathematical music theory (which doesn't have much to say about emotions, at least not yet), but the work of psychologists, like this:</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span>  Thank you  very much Sir for the references. What are the aspects of music  that  mathematical musical theory covers generally? I am assuming that it must cover the formation of different scales as well as similarity in patterns between different scales in a mathematical way. If each scale represents a particular set of emotions then naturally indirectly mathematical music theory should have a connection to the study of emotions. Am I misunderstanding anything here ?</p>

<p>Before equal temperament, different keys actually sounded different (because the intervals would be different sizes), so the key would convey emotion even to people with relative pitch.  This gave keys emotional connotations, which they still have today even now that we use equal temperament.</p>

<p>Since the human brain is extremely good at recognising patterns across all out different senses without us noticing, my guess is that when you <em>play</em> an instrument, the key of a piece gets associated to other pieces in the same key (and thus their emotions) via a "side channel" of the physical movements you have to do to play in that key</p>

<p>You can definitely, say, for instance, how harmony struggles with this. The near totality of rock music should be considered as cacophony from the point of view of classic music.</p>

<p>I think that this shows conclusively that in Lewis' analysis of Counterfactuals the truth of a counterfactual statement depends on the actual world. I am pretty sure that the proof theory at the end of the book would substantiate this.</p>

<p>It covers things like scales, chords, voice leadings, rhythms, etc.  In Western music there aren't so many scales as there in Indian music (ragas),  but there's also a lot more work on chords (bunches of notes within a scale, played simultaneously) and voice leadings (how to go from one chord to another chord).    </p>
<p>So, a huge amount of mathematical music theory focuses on studying chords and voice leadings.   This is especially true for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Riemannian_theory">neo-Riemannian theory</a>, which has been studied using categories.   I pointed you to two papers on that.

<p>If each scale represents a particular set of emotions then naturally indirectly mathematical music theory should have a connection to the study of emotions. Am I misunderstanding anything here ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most Western music in the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_practice_period">common practice period</a>" from 1650 to 1900 used mainly just two scales: major and minor.   So, the mathematical music theory I know doesn't have a lot to say about scales and emotions.  Everyone says "major is happy, minor is sad".   That's an oversimplification, but it's not really a good basis for the study of emotions!   It's also not very interesting mathematically.</p>
<p>There are probably music theorists who study emotions much more deeply.    But anyway, the use of <em>category theory</em> in music seems focused on neo-Riemannian theory, which is a detailed study of chords and voice leadings.</p>

<p>So, I guess what I'm saying is that anyone who wants to apply category theory to psychology has a lot of work to do.  It's good to try, but it will require that some experts on psychology and some experts on category theory work together for a few years.   I don't think existing work on category theory and music will help a lot.</p>

<p>That's only if you are using equal temperament (e.g. as on a piano).  Such use is actually quite "modern", and isn't really a good reflection of music "through the ages"!  If interested, try this book: "How Equal Temperament Ruined Harmony" by Ross Duffin.  ($10 in Kindle on Amazon)</p>

<p>The human voice can transpose music to any key without changing the ratios between tones; if you do this the different keys don't have different "flavors".   I bet most ordinary singers throughout the ages weren't well-trained enough to do anything else.  I think you need a bunch of well-tuned instruments around to associate different emotions to different keys.    I think most pianos in the world have generally been out of tune.</p>

<p>Now that most (?) music is generated electronically, we're getting used to really precise tuning.  With high-quality electronic instruments it should be easy to explore different tuning systems, but most people don't.  </p>
<p>My electronic piano has a bunch of different tuning system options.   I used to wonder if I could tell the difference, but it turns out to be easy: they all sound bad except for equal temperament.  And then, if I use another tuning system for a while, equal temperament sounds bad too.     When I reached the point where all tuning systems sounded bad, I decided I had to stop exploring this.</p>

<p>I think you have this backwards, John, or else I misunderstand what you are saying.  Till the (late?) 19th century, equal temperament was unusual - the intervals between the semitones were not all equal.  That was a relatively "modern" development.   And so the keys did have different flavours till then.  One frequent misunderstanding is what Bach meant by "Well Tempered Clavier" - most scholars now agree that he didn't mean "Equal Tempered Clavier".  There were several different tunings around then which attempted to allow one to use different keys without sounding "out of tune", but were not intended to have the same equal semitones.  But one can dispute that! ;-)   One can actually prove this historical claim pretty convincingly by investigating church organs from before the 19C, and apparently they are differently tuned in different places.  Each town (or whatever) having its own "preferred tuning", it seems.</p>
<p>And whatever this amounts to, certainly ordinary singers were well trained by all accounts - they gave each key its own flavour deliberately, as did (and do) players on instruments without fixed intervals (like the violin family) - I've been told by some violin-playing friends that when playing with other strings (like violas and cellos) that they do _not_ use equal temperament, because they get a better sound with "natural" intervals, and they prefer the sound.</p>

<p>I didn't make myself clear. </p>
<p>For different keys to have different flavors, we need a tuning system where individual notes (e.g. A, B, C, D,...) have specific frequencies attached to them.   Then a perfect fifth in the key of A will involve a different frequency ratio than a perfect fifth in the key of C.... unless we happen to use equal temperament.</p>
<p>But I'm suggesting that for a lot of musicians throughout a lot of history, it would be hard to have a setup where individual notes have specific frequencies attached to them!</p>
<p>Imagine the bare-bones situation: a group of people singing, with no instruments.   If they've got good ears it's easy for them to sing an octave, or a perfect fifth, etc.   So they can easily do something like Pythagorean tuning.   But unless they're really trying to make things complicated, their perfect fifth starting on one note will have the same ratio as their perfect fifth starting at any other note: 3/2.    That's because 3/2 is easy to do and it sounds great.   </p>
<p>This is not equal temperament, but it <em>also</em> means that different keys won't have different flavors, unless they work to achieve that.   </p>
<p>If they're singing in a church with an organ, then it's different: the organ will probably dictate the tuning system they use, as you suggest, and a song in the key of A will sound different than a song in the key of C.  But this is different from the highly mathematical approaches beloved by tuning freaks - you know, the kind who say "Kirnberger III is better than meantone temperament".  This is just people working with the instruments they have.    </p>
<p>I've been to a village in Bali that had a gamelan with an unusual tuning system:  that is part of the charm of that village.   I think there's no real way to tune most of the instruments in a gamelan after they're built.   To what extent can you tune a pipe organ?</p>

<p>Right!  But I was talking about a world without lots of precisely tuned instruments - the world of most people before electronics became cheap.   In that world, how much attention would people pay to absolute pitch?    If I'm an Inuit in ancient Greenland, or a poor peasant in medieval France, and I'm the only guy around with absolute pitch, am I going to complain that everyone else is singing a half-step sharp?   What does that even <em>mean?</em>    </p>
<p>Am I going to think a song sounds really different if it's sung a half-step higher?   (Quite possibly.)</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm getting a bit carried away talking about the Inuit.  A better example might be Gregorian chants, back before organs.  Did those monks have tuning forks, or did they just sort of wing it?  If the latter, they still could be really careful about getting the <em>relative</em> pitches within a chant exactly right.</p>

<p>So this is where we disagree - I'll let you look up some authorities on tuning before the 19th century.  But here is my understanding.  This is not a question of having tuning forks, or other tuners, since it wasn't the exact frequencies that were important (it's a fact that something like "middle C" was interpreted as a different frequency in different locales - even within the same country or society - this has been verified by checking the tuning of organ pipes, which once in place are rather difficult to retune!)  The question was of relative intervals - what a mathematician would regard as ratios of frequencies (so e.g. an octave is 2:1, etc).  And there were several tuning systems in place during the period before the 19th C - And still today there are are different tuning systems (e.g. as I said before with string quartets, etc).  So the different keys actually had different intervals between the notes of an octave - and hence different "qualities" - some thing that was lost with equal temperament.  </p>
<p>So, in short: we have nothing to teach musicians (say) before the 18th C - they knew how to tune their instruments "perfectly", and no electronic tuners were necessary - indeed, ask any solo guitarist today if they need such tuners!!  Certainly I never did - if the intervals between the strings were right (that can be done by ear), you're ready to go.  If you're playing with other guitarists, you all agree on (say) A, and go from there.  It gets more complicated the more instruments you're playing with, of course, and that's where a tuning fork or whatever is useful.  Or else just agree to agree with the violas!</p>

Either that or I'm misunderstanding what one or both of you are saying.  The tuning forks etc. nail down a base frequency to a particular note, and that nailing down, specifically, seems to be what John is avoiding.  If indeed "middle C" was interpreted as a different frequency in different locales, that would support not nailing down a base frequency to a particular note.  And I know enough European music history to know that you are absolutely correct that "middle C" was interpreted as a different frequency in different locales.</p>

<p>Given a tempering and a base frequency for that tempering (e.g. the same equipment in the same conditions is used between trials), I'm sure many people could discern the differences when you transpose a piece to a neighboring key if the tempering is not equal.  I don't think there is any disagreement there.  I would also suggest that's not really the interesting phenomenon here – different things are perceived as different, which is practically useful, but not very interesting.</p>
<p>Given a tempering, but allowing the base frequency to change between performances of a piece (suppose A is 425 Hz for one performance, but 440 Hz for another performance – perhaps you listen to an organ performance in one locale, then listen to it again in another locale) will probably give "isomorphic" performances to most people, since most people do not have absolute pitch.  As long as the relative frequencies are identical between performances, I don't think most people would notice a difference (especially if the piece features a positive number of changes in key).  By the way, I'm using the word isomorphism loosely here, hence the scare quotes.  I doubt there is an honest isomorphism here; see below.</p>
<p><em>I</em> find this to be a more interesting phenomenon, as different things are perceived as the same.  It would be interesting to see what is the threshold ratio of frequencies before that "isomorphism" breaks.  I doubt most people would fail to recognize the difference if the transposition is by an octave, for instance!</p>

<p>One can of course in this topological view of the space of possibilities, have points be possible worlds (a whole state of a universe). But it could also be temporal views with divergent futures and divergent pasts. David Lewis defines a counterpart relation on objects so that one can speak of objects that have some sort of identity relation across worlds.  The relation between Kripke and Lewis' notion of identity across worlds is analysed in Kohei Kishida's CT based thesis <a href="http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/10224/">Generalised Topological Semantics for First-Order Modal Logic</a>. (He does not look at Counterfactuals though, which brings a whole new dimension to the picture). One major interest is how Counterfactuals shows how non-monotonic reasoning works. And that is what we humans are best at. We are tuned for contextual shifts.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://t.co/gAUdGTxqmU?amp=1">Man, Android, Machine</a> one can see how Philip K. Dick takes this counterpart view seriously. There are many of our counterparts that have exactly the same view and beliefs of the world. These are subjectively indistinguishable: that is you could not tell where on a map one is located. (This sounds like Homotopy Type Theory 's view of equality could be usefully applied here). One is streched out so to say across worlds, or over this space. (In classical view we are in exactly one world, but Lewis' view can easily take quantum indeterminacy into account).  Still beliefs being spaces of possbilities, reality may force us to the realisation that the world we thought we inhabited is just "a dream"). Such transformations correspond to such morphisms.

<p>You keep saying things I agree with, and acting like I disagree.  I think our misunderstanding comes from the fact that I'm talking about the realm of music where <em>keyboards</em>, and tuning forks, and other such devices aren't available, so that it gets harder to lock down any sort of tuning system.   </p>
<p>So: I'm not talking about 19th century or 18th century or 17th century or 16th century European art music, where they had keyboards easily available.   I'm talking about music like Gregorian chants, or pickup bands where a bunch of people start singing or playing the fiddle: <em>music where you get to decide on the tuning afresh each time you play a piece</em>.  I was trying to say most of the music played by most people for most of history was like this, and I was trying to say that in this situation it gets hard for different keys to have different "personalities".</p>
<p>On a keyboard, the different keys will have different "personalities" (sets of frequency ratios) unless you adopt equal temperament.  Equal temperament lets you transpose any interval however you like and get another interval with the same frequency ratio.   But without equal temperament, a major third (for example) in some key must have a different frequency ratio than a major third in some other key.  So I completely agree that before the rise of equal temperament, keyboard music gave different keys different personalities.  This era goes back at least to 1511, it seems:</p>

I was talking about music where people strike up a tune purely with their voices, with no keyboard - or tuning fork, or anything else - to regiment them.  In this situation they can choose the tonic to be at any pitch they like, and choose to sing in Pythagorean tuning - or whatever tuning they like - starting from that tonic.   If they then sing starting from an A, a major third above that can have a frequency 4:3 as high... and if they sing starting from a B, a major third above that can have a frequency 4:3 as high... etc.   If they do this, different keys won't have different "personalities" (sets of frequency ratios).    </p>
<p>Of course if they <em>want</em> they can choose to sing in such a way that different keys have different personalities, but without the aid of an instrument like a keyboard this seems harder.</p>

 A very good example of such subjective trip through space, is from the famous computer animation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratatouille_(film)">Ratatouille</a>, where right at the end of the film the stern art critique tastes the dish made up by the mouse, and is transported back to his childhood, in a way reminscent to the famous work by Marcel Proust <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Search_of_Lost_Time">In Search of Lost Time</a> where the whole book unfolds from his eating a <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeleine_(pâtisserie)">Madeleine</a>.

<p>Ok - this clarifies the point of difference, thanks!  But I would still beg to differ - I wasn't talking about keyboards (hence the explicit reference to guitars etc), but rather the intervals between tones.  And that remains the issue I think.  Singers, string players, and especially wind instruments (before keys!) all are very aware of the "natural" intervals between notes, and in the era of "natural temperaments", it really does make a difference where you put the various "big" and "small" semitones.  So: it really doesn't matter what your A is (as a frequency), but it does matter where the large and small semitone intervals occur.  And so different "keys" (even if they're not called that) will sound different.  They might not say they are singing in A or C or whatever, but different "scales" would still be something to be aware of.  </p>
<p>But at this point I suspect we've drifted from the topics at hand .... ;-)   On this we'll agree, probably: different keys became a bigger deal with the advent of popular keyboard instruments.  (Remember my story of the harpsichordist who changed tuning  and so temperaments several times during her concert of Elizabethan music.)</p>

<p>Indeed I said the same thing a while back:</p>

Equal temperament lets you transpose any interval however you like and get another interval with the same frequency ratio.

<p>Do we have any string players here? I studied viola a bit, but on a very basic level... I remember spending many, many hours once trying to learn how to make a diminished fifth sound right, and then going to the next lesson feeling that I was totally incompetent - and then my teacher saying that I had made a huge progress and that my intonation was much better...</p>
<p>I think that "real" string players should have lots of stories on how to find the right tuning for pieces - and it would be fun to hear how they tell these stories to an audience of mathematicians.</p>

<p>Late to the discussion, but I play in string quartets a fair amount, and I have a faulty but nonnegligible sense of perfect pitch.</p>
<p>Our default pitch tendency probably is equal temperament, but when we really sit down to tune a chord, it’s more about negotiating that particular chord at that moment in time (usually in the order of root, octave, fifth, third, seventh – i.e. more consonant intervals first). It’s much more dynamic than how a keyboard would be tuned: in a string quartet, the same note will sit in different places in different chords.</p>
<p>So I don’t think we end up with markedly different characters in different keys, mostly because it isn’t globally coherent. But sometimes we do have to negotiate chords with open strings differently, and the relationship there would vary by key.</p>
<p>Thus I tend to agree with John that I wouldn’t expect marked differences in different keys, unless the singers/performers were led to emulate it for some other reason than pure consonance/blending.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: we cellists usually “get” to win the tuning disagreements ;)</p>

<p>Musical anhedonia is a thing, so the way music interacts with the human brain seems to be a tad more complicated.</p>

<p>From our exposure to music we may  assume that  every scale (a sequence of musical notes ) when played in a particular time signature they somehow  expresses a particular human emotion. Though the converse may not be true that is whether every emotion can be expressed through some sequence of musical notes or not. If I assume that the converse is also true then in some sense studying human emotions will be same as studying different scale patterns in music. But I guess that  there are some good work on axiomatising music theory through category theory (for example <em>The Topos of Music</em> <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783764357313">https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783764357313</a>). So in that case can the study of music theory will be considered as a study of human emotions(which is a part of human psychology)?</p>
<p>I apologise priorly if I sound very naive. I am a music enthusiast and play some musical instruments. I always felt the connection of emotion and music. So I am just curious.</p>

<p>We are currently using our quantum natural language framework, which is categorical, to generate music on quantum computers in collaboration with <a href="https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/staff/eduardo-miranda">https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/staff/eduardo-miranda</a>  This must be the wildest thing I have ever done.</p>

<p>I guess it would be interesting to have a music and mathematics thread. I'd be interested to know if there anyone has used the work from "The Topos of Music" to create new music that could not have been thought of before, or indeed if any music had come out of it. </p>
<p>Not sure if the quantum computer work is related, but can one listen to anything? <br>
(I know nothing about music theory so perhaps it is just that learning of it from the CT Side would be a good way to learn a new way to think of category theory)</p>

<p>I came across this <a href="https://hiddenbrain.org/podcast/one-head-two-brains/">NPR interview of Ian McGilchrist</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iain_McGilchrist">wikipedia page</a>) on a book of his from 2010 "The Master and His Emissary; The Divided Brain and the Making of the Western World".  The author of the book <a href="https://paradigmexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Network-Review-2009-101-final.pdf#page=5">according to medical journal article</a>, was 2009 Fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists and fellow of All Souls College, Oxford. </p>
<p>Let me assume that what he has written is generally correct - and I am sure there are people here who will have much better informed opinions on this. There is an interesting claim that the asymmetry in responsibility between left and right brain goes back 800 million years, that is that extremly simple creatures also have this asymetry.  The thesis is to simplify that the right part of the brain looks at generalities - one could call it context - and the left is geared more to precision, analytic, goal directed thought. The left hemisphere's focus helps the animal catch the prey, the right hemisphere helps the animal be aware of its surroundings to stop it from being prey.</p>
<p>If this asymetry is so old, one may wonder if apart from being evolutionary based, which of course it has to be, if it is not also evolution discovering or using mathematical structures.</p>

<p>For example it seems remarkably close to dualities one finds between say monads focused inside a context, and comonads which have a position but operate on contexts.</p>

<p>Somewhat unrelatedly, the asymmetry in vertebrate anatomy can be traced back to the fact that <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0410">cilia twist in one direction, not another</a>.  There have been a lot of papers about this; I'm just linking to a random one.</p>

<p><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CguW_vwAAAAJ">Susan Awbrey</a> and I have worked a lot and written a little on a variety of &ldquo;two-culture&rdquo; and &ldquo;cognitive style&rdquo; questions from a broadly pragmatic perspective informed by the work of C.S.&nbsp;Peirce, John Dewey, and like-minded thinkers.&nbsp; The three dimensional spaces of Peirce’s triadic sign relations afford a perspective on the ways diverse thinkers can specialize their thought to different planes or facets of a sign relation’s full volume. &nbsp; Sue has taught at all levels from middle school to graduate school and understands educational development and organizational diversity far better than I have any hopes of doing so I may try to talk her into joining in.&nbsp; Various issues along these lines are discussed in the following paper.</p>
