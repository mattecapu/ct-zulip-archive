<p>It makes me laugh how you ACT guys really seem to think that category theory is <em>the</em> tool to solve global challenges and save the planet. It reminds me of the quote "If the only tool you have is a hammer, it is tempting to treat everything as if it were a nail." If you would leave your small bubble for a moment you would see that this is a first-class idiocy.</p>
<p>It's also weird how you guys use every opportunity to mention the name of Grothendieck and suggest you are the ones continuing his vision:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those who continue [Grothendieck's] work today still seek the unification of mathematics with politics and spirituality that he was unable to achieve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His political activity was <em>against</em> mathematical research.</p>
<p>It sometimes seems to me you are a cult of Grothendieck-worshippers led by high priest John Baez. But you aren't a cult, are you?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given the power of applied category theory, it would seem reasonable to restrict access to a secret society, where we vet people for moral character before allowing them to learn category theory.</p>

<p>Thanks for the candid feedback.  I don't mean to give the impression that ACT is <em>the</em> tool to solve global challenges and save the planet, I simply think it has the potential to be <em>a</em> powerful tool for these things.  </p>
<p>As for Grothendieck, though his political activity was indeed against mathmatical research, it came from the same place (listening with deep attention) as his mathematical work.  So he became internally divided:</p>
<p>An example of this internal conflict, from <a href="https://www.mat.uc.pt/~picado/lawvere/interview.pdf">https://www.mat.uc.pt/~picado/lawvere/interview.pdf</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My last meeting with him was at the same place in 1989 (Aurelio Carboni drove me there from Milano): he was clearly glad to see me but would not speak, the result of a religious vow; he wrote on paper that he was also forbidden to discuss mathematics, though quickly his mathematical soul triumphed, leaving me with some precious mathematical notes.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="280784">@Joshua Meyers</span>, I think if you rephrased things to be “I statements” instead of presuming to speak for others or imply projects that would require coercing others’ actions, that will be much less controversial.  </p>
<p>Rephrasing to say something about the kinds of projects <em>you personally</em> feel comfortable engaging in, is principled and sane people will respect this.  </p>
<p>Also demonstrate to your potential clients that you are capable of separating the personal from the professional.  This is critically important if they are to trust you. </p>
<p>In particular, whether or not other people have children, is a <em>very personal choice</em>.  That goes on a blog, which you can link to, but not your professional page.</p>
<p>Or at least that is my 2 cents as someone who earns a living consulting by applying math and compsci to projects I find meaningful.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="280784">@Joshua Meyers</span> Thank you for your calm answer to my - admittedly a bit provocative (but still honest) - feedback.</p>
<p>For reference here is the quote from your website I was (implicitly) referring to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Applied Category Theory (ACT) is a very new kind of math which focuses on systems rather than optimization. Hence it is well-suited for addressing the world's most pressing issues (...) There is a shared understanding in the ACT community that we are sitting on a gold-mine — ACT is powerful stuff — but it is not clear to us how to make use of this gold-mine for good, as we are mostly mathematicians with little understanding of the world outside mathematics. Furthermore, we are very anxious about others making use of this gold-mine for evil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mathematics is only one field of knowledge - there's also medicine, engineering, sociology, physics, geography, computer science, and so on, most of which seem more directly useful for solving global challenges than mathematics. And even within mathematics, there is discrete mathematics, probablity theory, mathematical optimization, calculus, and so on, which also have great potential for being applied. What makes ACT so special compared to all of these other fields when it comes to solving "the world's most pressing issues"?</p>
<p>Honestly this exaggerated advertising of ACT seems a bit ridiculous to me. To be fair, this is something I am observing for a while in this community and it is just a coincidence that I am expressing my opinion in this thread for the first time.</p>

<p>For historical comparisons one might look to Cybernetics, System Dynamics, Complex Systems, etc.  etc.</p>
<p>Many of their proponents and early adopters also thought they were sitting on a gold mine and capable of changing the world.  And they were not wrong — those fields <em>did have important impacts</em> and IMO still have important and unique insights that are relevant to the world … but the historical trajectory of each also serves as a mediating lesson about the virtues of humility and not getting over-hyped.</p>

<p>Glad to precipitate a first expression of your opinion!</p>
<p>Nowhere in the website do I compare ACT to other fields and say it's somehow more suited for addressing "the world's most pressing issues" than other fields such as "medicine, engineering, sociology, etc.".  No doubt many other fields are also crucial.  Within math, I do claim that it is uniquely important, because it discusses <em>systems</em>, and "the world's most pressing issues" are systemic rather than simply problems of optimization.</p>

<p>Many of their proponents and early adopters also thought they were sitting on a gold mine and capable of changing the world.

<p>Category theory in the real world is just one tool amongst many, and no more of a tool than say real analysis / differential equations, statistics, rhetoric / persuasion, et cetera. Whether it will be useful at all in a particular situation will depend entirely on contextual factors. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Applied Category Theory (ACT) is a very new kind of math which focuses on systems rather than optimization. Hence it is well-suited for addressing the world's most pressing issues, which are systemic in nature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Category theory might be useful in analysing systems in the real world, but for many issues that the world faces, the solutions to the issues are likely going to be political and sociological in nature rather than technical, which means that category theory and most other mathematics won't likely be able to help.</p>

<p>If you’re serious about it, you’ll need to be able to put in the work even when you don’t feel like it, because you promised someone you would, without making it personal — eg ask for what you need when problems arise with minimal emotional labor from your client / collaborator.  </p>
<p>Your self worth must not ride on always knowing more category theory (or anything else), or on someone else’s approval.  It is independent of work, allowing you to be reliable and explore uncertainty.</p>
<p>Let’s consider what others need to help motivate it…</p>
<p>Let’s say I am a business or personal coming to you, considering paying you to work on my challenging problem.   In doing so I will have to reveal things my competitors could use against me.  I also need to feel safe enough to admit when I don’t know things, which later might become quite important.  So clients need discretion and privacy, and they highly value predictability.  </p>
<p>Regarding the last, clients want to know that you will not suddenly decide they are “Bad” and then violate all those contracts of trust, or abandon the project for some kind of intensely personal reason they will find it very hard to predict or avoid.  This is especially true in small business where lawsuits are just not an accessible expense.</p>
<p>When there is no separation of personal and professional, there is no demonstrated ability to do these things.  It makes the calculus of whether to engage with you <em>so much harder</em> and forces the client to think of all kinds of potential ramifications… serious + stable + honest people will probably just default to “no”.</p>
<p>But equally if not more  importantly, the ability to separate really forces <em>you</em> to get clear with yourself about what your boundaries and intentions are.  About what you can actually promise and follow through with.</p>
<p>I <em>dont mean you split yourself</em>.  Please remain whole!</p>
<p>I mean do the self-work to understand </p>
<ul>
<li>what you want and what you need, </li>
<li>what you can control (eg your actions), </li>
<li>what you cannot, </li>
<li>and demonstrate you know the difference through clear statements you can adhere to.  </li>
</ul>
<p>This allows others to make decisions with fully informed consent about whether to engage with you or not.</p>
<p>I can recommend Brene Brown’s book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dare-Lead-Brave-Conversations-Hearts/dp/0399592520">dare to lead</a> on ethical leadership as very helpful for people going into self-employment, and especially consulting where you think the stakes are high, which you seem to.</p>

<p>My point is that there is a big gap between "analysing systems in the real world" and the "addressing the world's most pressing issues" in that paragraph. </p>
<p>For example, climate science and the climate models developed in the past 40 years have been useful in analysing Earth's climate and human contributions to the climate, but getting people to change their behaviour to reduce their contributions or adapt to the changing climate has been mostly unsuccessful. The world's pressing issue here isn't modelling Earth's climate, it's getting people (including those who are preaching to others about the dangers of climate change) to change their behaviour. While category theory will enable climate scientists to build better models, it mostly likely won't convince people to change their behaviour; i.e. if people have the attitude "I know my current actions will help doom our civilization but I don't care, I don't want to give up my current lifestyle", no amount of accurate modelling of the climate will change their mind.</p>

<p>Regarding the actual content of the fields… Cybernetics I can recommend Norbert Weiner’s book.  For System Dynamics, Forester.  For Complex Systems maybe … Yaneer Bar-Yam?  Or you could look at Gleick’s breathless popsci book on Chaos Theory.  If you can’t find those affordable reach out.</p>
<p>The history of each has not been as well documented as it deserves to be afaik.  But if you even skim those books you will probably get the sense that these were very smart big-picture thinkers who had their own mathematical languages and their own techniques for approaching problems and they <em>really believed</em> these were incredibly important.</p>
<p>The very fact that you would need to ask for a history book means in some sense they were not successful at their revolutions.</p>
<p>I don’t mean they failed!  I just mean that any grandiose ambitions for changing the world by changing the abstractions we use / the way we think, have not come to pass.  Change is hard, and context matters, as Madeleine deftly pointed out.</p>

<p>With regard to the message that started this discussion, my impression of the ACT community is that, far from being a “cult”, it is a very disjointed community which includes people that embrace the basic culture/values/aesthetics of the mathematics community at large, as well as people that embrace those of the "formal methods" CS community, as well as people who are somewhere on the programmer/hacker spectrum, as well as all sorts of people inbetween and <br>
 unclassifiable oddballs; if there's a unifying feature, it's that whoever went into ACT so far, is most likely to <em>not</em> be a hype-follower, as this is, by all reasonable standards, a niche field with very little "real" power; and if it seems that ACT people spend an unreasonable time promoting and justifying the "power of category theory" or what not, I think it is done because one is compelled to "justify" niche choices in ways that are not requested of the mainstream. Nobody who decides to be the millionth cog doing incremental improvements in machine learning or whatever needs to spend a second of their time justifying their field. Certainly I do not enjoy having to respond to questions about "the power of category theory" and I believe 95% of what is construed as "hype" around ACT is done begrudgingly by researchers who would much rather spend their time proving theorems.</p>

<p>And I think that, like other "niche" communities, this also tends to attract some people like Joshua here, who have further out-of-left-field ideas about monastic communities of mathematicians or whatever.<br>
What I find incredibly boring is that then suddenly these out-of-left-field ideas are taken to be representative of what the whole community is like. It seems to me exactly the same mechanism by which left-wing activists which in large majority are completely reasonable people doing valuable community work are taken to also be responsible for the slightly-too-weird statements of some random student.</p>

<p>Some of the hype coming out of ACT I view as largely coming from the fact that category theory is a niche field, and its practitioners need something to justify continued funding for the field, as opposed to using that funding for something like infrastructure or health care. It's the same hype phenomena that's afflicted various niche subfields of physics like string theory, AdS/CFT research, quantum gravity, etc whose actual relevance to society is very small. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the hype isn't sustainable, as sooner or later people will notice the gap between the hype and the reality and conclude that the field is a failure because it cannot fulfill its own promises. See the terrible reputation of string theory these days - John Baez himself quit string theory in the mid 2000s because of the growing failures of string theory's promises.</p>

<p>The purpose of the "manifesto" type material on my website is to explain to the wider world what ACT is and why it is important (I don't buy that it's just "hype" I think ACT is really important).  I think that to speak about a community that one is in, and/or to speak on behalf of the community (using "we"), it is sufficient to be attuned to this community and especially to its leaders, which I am, by means of many interactions in the community in the last 6 or so years.  Through this attunement I do have a sense of the zeitgeist of the community, which I am simply describing as I have witnessed it.  That said, I did run the website by some other people in the community who are even more attuned than me before publishing, and they didn't see any serious problems with it.</p>
<p>I think it's important to note that I am publishing this text under my own name, and take personal responsibility for everything I say.  It's not some sort of anonymous manifesto or something.  If you want to know the particular milieu of ACT I am associated with look at the <a href="https://meygerjos.com/aboutme">about me section of the website</a>.  My main bias I think is that I am much more involved in US ACT than European ACT.</p>
<p>As for separation of the personal from the professional, you still didn't really answer my question.  Of course it is important to be trustworthy, which includes making only agreements I can keep, keeping those agreements, keeping confidentiality when appropriate, etc.  I hope that prospective clients will adequately assess my trustworthiness as part of deciding whether and how to work with me, and not trust me more or less than I deserve.  However, I don't see at all what dividing personal and professional has to do with this.</p>

<p>My point is that there is a big gap between "analysing systems in the real world" and the "addressing the world's most pressing issues" in that paragraph. </p>
<p>For example, climate science and the climate models developed in the past 40 years have been useful in analysing Earth's climate and human contributions to the climate, but getting people to change their behaviour to reduce their contributions or adapt to the changing climate has been mostly unsuccessful. The world's pressing issue here isn't modelling Earth's climate, it's getting people (including those who are preaching to others about the dangers of climate change) to change their behaviour. While category theory will enable climate scientists to build better models, it mostly likely won't convince people to change their behaviour; i.e. if people have the attitude "I know my current actions will help doom our civilization but I don't care, I don't want to give up my current lifestyle", no amount of accurate modelling of the climate will change their mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Getting people to change their behavior is also a systemic problem.  Economic systems, governance systems, educational systems, etc.</p>

<p>Could happen.  Right now ACT is a promise.  Maybe it will pan out, maybe it won't.  I really hope it will!</p>
<p>In order for it to have any chance, there need to be people who have the time and energy to learn both category theory and some target domain that they want to apply it to (see <a href="https://meygerjos.com/lawvereprophecy">Lawvere's Prophecy</a>).  This happens pretty rarely as far as it can tell.</p>
<p>Worst case scenario is this doesn't happen for a long time, ACT consequently doesn't fulfill its promises, and then people unjustifiably conclude that it was all just hype.</p>
<p>A better scenario is that this does happen, ACT still doesn't fulfill its promises, and then people justifiably conclude that it was hype.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276363">@Amar Hadzihasanovic</span>  To be clear: My "cult" comment was sarcastic based on the idea of a secret society. I never intended to judge the ACT community as a whole, I only wanted to critize some weird behaviour that I repeatedly observed in this community and which I consider to be influenced by John Baez (including exaggerated advertising, Grothendieck name-dropping, recommendation to have fewer children).<br>
So I am sorry to have used this thread as an excuse to express my general impression that built up over time, and I am relieved that even <a href="#narrow/stream/229111-community.3A-general/topic/Freelance.20ACT/near/454873486">Joshua himself</a> appreciated me sharing my thoughts. In hindsight I could have used less harsh words, but my opinion is still the same.</p>
<p>My use of the phrase "woke mind virus" is of course controversial. But I can tell you that this is not related to the standard left-vs-right political debate. Elon Musk explains the "mind virus" in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tza2W-wAkLk&amp;ab_channel=JoeBros">this video</a> as follows:</p>
<div class="youtube-video message_inline_image"><a data-id="Tza2W-wAkLk" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tza2W-wAkLk&amp;ab_channel=JoeBros"><img src="https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/2281cf2b447d0cd654b0afcaedbe4036b7002098/68747470733a2f2f692e7974696d672e636f6d2f76692f547a6132572d77416b4c6b2f64656661756c742e6a7067"></a></div><blockquote>
<p>I'm pro environment, but in the limit, if environmentalism is taken to an extreme, you start to view humanity as a plague on the surface of the earth, like a mold or something. But this is actually false, the earth could take probably ten times the current civilization, you can 10x the population without destroying the rainforest. So the environmental movement has gone too far.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And promoting people to have fewer children is, for me, a perfect example of the environmental movement going too far. This has nothing to do with me being right or against left. Actually, I kind of like the idea of monastic communities you mention.</p>
<p>Suggesting me to be on the political right seems to me exactly the same mechanism which far-left activists use to discredit any other opinions.</p>
<p>And while we are on this topic, another thing I want to critize is John Baez's constant mocking of Elon Musk and their collective quitting of Twitter/X, while <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1811783320839008381">surely by now</a> it's clear that this is one of the last big platforms supporting free speech.<br>

</blockquote>
<p>Sure, you can model with category theory how people tend to change their behaviour in society, but there is still a huge gap from the model to actually trying to get people to change their behaviour. Getting people to change their behavior is also a systemic problem which doesn't lend itself easily to one-approach-fits-all technocratic solutions like what is being promised here. </p>
<p>Economic systems, governance systems, educational systems, etc are systems which are fraught with many complex political and sociological factors and many self-interested actors who are interested in the system for their own selfish reasons, and many actors who have beliefs for how the systems themselves should work that differ significantly from applied category theory. Most of the solutions to the systemic problems are unwieldy compromises between different factions of society which just barely work in reality but contain many aspects which each faction do not like. </p>
<p>I don't think that the niche field of applied category theory will itself solve the problems in most of these systems, compared to actually existing forces in society like political parties, mass media, corporations, non-government organisations, and so on. At best, applied category theory becomes one of many tools used by all sides of the never-ending fights in human society, by American corporations, Russian private military companies, the Chinese Communist Party, warlords in Africa, both the Israeli government and Hamas, et cetera, some of whom will purposefully apply category theory to prevent problems from being solved.</p>

Of course theorizing is no subsitute for action.  However, at certain historical moments, sufficiently developed theory can be implemented to real effect.  A relevant example of this is how Stafford Beer's management cybernetics was implemented in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Cybersyn">Project Cybersyn</a>, which I am currently studying.  Another, even more basic example is how Turing's theories were implemented in the modern computer.</p>

Unlike some others in this thread I have no political squabble to pick here, I’m just trying to help.

<p>What I mean is exactly that some parts of the history of category theory are obscure today, after almost a century; not only because it is complicated to trace back the actual content of the inflamed discussions that took place -at a slower pace, outside internet-, but also because history is <em>extremely</em> complex to unravel even having all sources in good order. Not by chance, history is something you need a degree in, before you start writing about it.</p>

<p>I didn't say anything about your description being inaccurate. The claim is at a higher level of abstraction: you have taken on yourself a right to speak for a community that never granted you that right. Even if your claims were all descriptively accurate it would be unethical to make them in this situation.</p>

<p>You are well aware of people in the community who don't feel the way you describe--you even point out on the very page under discussion that Jade's position "made waves." The most exhaustingly interminable debates on this server are around precisely the controversial topics you describe as "the community's" anxieties. So, it's impossible to see how you could in good faith claim that you believe this is an accurate description of "the community's anxieties", unless you are intentionally gatekeeping the community to those who share your anxieties.</p>

<p>I agree, I think that Ross Douthat and many journalists could use a similar refresher, that they should say "I" instead of "we" and say "my buddies" rather than "250M Americans".  that's really the point here, imo - journalistic accuracy should be just as important as mathematical/scientific accuracy, to Ross and Josh and me and everyone.  I can see how consent can improve or degrade accuracy, but fundamentally, I see this as about accuracy rather than consent</p>

<p>John Baez's talk on one hand goes too far, and on the other hand does not go far enough. </p>

<li>the dependency on cars (electric and petrol powered cars both result in an increase in greenhouse gases, for different reasons)</li>
<li>the use of the internet, television, other technologies, and electricity in general, </li>
<li>indulgence in processed foods, animal products in factory farms, produce from industrial agriculture, etc rather than raising chickens and a vegetable garden in your backyard</li>
<li>finding another job or vocation if the current one requires you to be dependent on the industrial system and contributing to climate change, and being willing to take a step down in social status or living standards to achieve that.</li>

<p>This said, honest feedback: the page is terrible. As a person running a profitable business I can tell you everyone has his own way of doing things, so my opinion is probably not universal. Yet, personally, I have a very strict policy of not hiring mentally unstable people, no matter how good they are, because that plays terribly with company culture in the long run. I know many people that think the same thing, after all "minimising stuff that can go wrong" is a popular strategy in business.</p>
<p>From what I've read on your site, you sound really mentally unstable and disconnected from reality, and more in the "crackpot" way than in the "lone genius" one. I'd never hire you because you don't strike me as reliable in this respect.</p>
<p>I also share all the criticism other people expressed in this thread, but if I have to be completely honest those are secondary issues, whereas for me the primary issue is the one above.</p>
<p>Disregarding vibes, from a more practical POV, if I have to pay for someone's services I want a person that is reliable, down to earth and gets the job done. Importantly , if I pay you to solve a problem, then the problem should be the focus of your attention. The idea I get from your page is the opposite of that: I see a person obsessed with Category Theory that just wants to use it no matter what. So I know that my problem will never be the focus of your attention, category theory will. That's a big no for me.</p>
<p>All in all, it seems to me that what you really want is getting paid to think about stuff you like and are interested in. If that's the case I'd stick with academia, which is the only field that gets close to that, modulo admin stuff.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="609515">@Kevin Carlson</span> I think <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="281326">@Ryan Wisnesky</span>  makes a great point - this is about accuracy, not consent.  The concern is that I am characterizing the community inaccurately.  I just skimmed <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2020/12/the_lie_of_its_just_math.html">the conversation that I linked to</a> to illustrate that Jade "made waves" and it is true that not all the voices in the conversation have the anxieties that I discuss.  However, I don't think that it is necessary for every single member of a community to have a particular anxiety in order for it to be true that the community, taken as a whole, has that anxiety.  This is similar to how it does not have to be the case that every single part of my psyche has an anxiety in order for me, taken as a whole, to have that anxiety --- I may entertain many divergent viewpoints in my mental talk, some holding the anxiety and some not holding it.  That conversation is a great example of the community as a whole reckoning with these anxieties that I mention, some through holding to them (in divergent ways), some through dismissing them (again, in divergent ways) --- all different responses to the core anxieties of the community.</p>

<p>Given the power of applied category theory, it would seem reasonable to restrict access to a secret society, where we vet people for moral character before allowing them to learn category theory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is completely unreasonable to restrict access to a secret society. It is already 60 years too late for anything remotely approaching this. Category theory is being used all around the world for decades and you can't just say "we're going to force everybody else to forget about category theory while a group of American researchers are going to monopolise and gatekeep the knowledge". </p>
<p>It's like a group of real analysts saying, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given the power of the real numbers, it would seem reasonable to restrict access to a secret society, where we vet people for moral character before allowing them to learn about the real numbers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and they will have much more of a point, considering the centuries of historical evidence where people have used the real numbers for ill will. Nevertheless, it is impossible, since the knowledge of the real numbers is already out there in the world and cannot be suppressed. </p>
<p>A discussion about the ethics of mathematics is well worth having but over-the-top statements like these just detract from the point that you are trying to make. Name dropping the Grothendieck 2010 letter is also somewhat a distraction. I would just go directly to the point, state that the ACT community believes in making category theory open for everybody and the reasons why the community believes in openness.</p>

<p>I would have just used "extinctionist mind virus" or something along those lines if I were in your position and wanted to use something derogatory, since it more accurately reflects the current topic at hand; i.e. the contents of John Baez's speech and the climate change movement writ large. </p>
<p>Personally I see no need to draw in an issue which is orthogonal to the one at hand and is likely to alienate potential supporters of your position. There are woke people and people who do not care about the woke issue at all who oppose the current rhetoric and actions coming from climate change activists. Conversely, there are anti-woke climate change activists. So using "woke" is simply a terrible decision that has no upsides and considerable downsides. </p>
<p>Also I see "political correctness" as just a synonym for "woke" which was used in the 1990s, not really related to the climate change movement and its rhetoric at all. With climate change activism there is a sense of apocalyptic fear rather than political correctness, apocalyptic fear that humans are going to go extinct; it reminds me more of the apocalyptic fear and rhetoric on some portions of the European right that mass immigration is going to cause the extinction of Europeans, and then promoting desperate unrealistic solutions to mass immigration like genociding all non-Europeans, which has many of the same distastful anti-human vibe to it as some of the climate change movement's rhetoric today. Like, yes, climate change is a huge issue that humans have to learn to adapt to and aim to reduce, and immigration is a huge issue that Europeans will have to figure out how to reduce down to levels suitable for Europe, but using extreme rhetoric about humans or Europeans going extinct will simply turn people away from their cause.</p>

The concern is that I am characterizing the community inaccurately.  I just skimmed <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2020/12/the_lie_of_its_just_math.html">the conversation that I linked to</a> to illustrate that Jade "made waves" and it is true that not all the voices in the conversation have the anxieties that I discuss.  However, I don't think that it is necessary for every single member of a community to have a particular anxiety in order for it to be true that the community, taken as a whole, has that anxiety.  This is similar to how it does not have to be the case that every single part of my psyche has an anxiety in order for me, taken as a whole, to have that anxiety --- I may entertain many divergent viewpoints in my mental talk, some holding the anxiety and some not holding it.  That conversation is a great example of the community as a whole reckoning with these anxieties that I mention, some through holding to them (in divergent ways), some through dismissing them (again, in divergent ways) --- all different responses to the core anxieties of the community.</p>

<p>I would ask, how representative is the nCafé comment section of the ACT community? It is possible that a small but loud minority is discussing ethics online while the majority of applied category theorists are busy working on whatever, unaware that this conversation had taken place. It is also possible that all of the applied category theorists as of 2020 have commented that thread.</p>

As a member of this community, I strongly recommend you</p>
<ul>
<li>Not to speak on anyone's behalf (especially not mine)</li>
<li>Not to overpromise about applied category theory's power.<br>
I already know a few people (I'm not going to say their names) who <em>dropped</em> any interest in category theory because it didn't deliver what it promised. No matter what we do now, these people will think we're all crackpots. Overpromising hurts the work of all those hard-working people in our field which are doing their best to deliver. (I'm doing my best to be counted in them.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I understand that you are very passionate about category theory, I am too. And you, like me, would like to tell society, <em>please support us in doing category theory, it's not just fun to us, it's important for everyone</em>. I'm fully with you on this. But there's a right way to do it, and overpromising, in the slightly longer term, hurts us.</p>

<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="408864">@Leopold Schlicht</span> I do not consider the expression "woke mind virus" acceptable.

<p>I strongly agree with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276363">@Amar Hadzihasanovic</span> when he says ACT is far more diverse and faceted than sometimes people realize. I think you're committing this mistake, Jules.</p>
<p>Also in the past I've been annoyed by certain pushes to define what 'application' or 'compositionality'/'category theory' mean in the context of ACT, and maybe this is a good opportunity to say that one shouldn't gatekeep those terms. As said before in this thread, it's fine to have personal opinions but a line is crossed when those are reported as widely shared in the community or even self-evident.</p>
<p>So, I'm glad you refrained from publishing that draft :)</p>

<p>It is completely unreasonable to restrict access to a secret society. It is already 60 years too late for anything remotely approaching this. Category theory is being used all around the world for decades and you can't just say "we're going to force everybody else to forget about category theory while a group of American researchers are going to monopolise and gatekeep the knowledge".</p>

<p>Right, it is unreasonable rather than reasonable, I'll tweak the wording somehow to make it correct.</p>

As a member of this community, I strongly recommend you</p>
<ul>
<li>Not to speak on anyone's behalf (especially not mine)</li>
<li>Not to overpromise about applied category theory's power.<br>
I already know a few people (I'm not going to say their names) who <em>dropped</em> any interest in category theory because it didn't deliver what it promised. No matter what we do now, these people will think we're all crackpots. Overpromising hurts the work of all those hard-working people in our field which are doing their best to deliver. (I'm doing my best to be counted in them.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I understand that you are very passionate about category theory, I am too. And you, like me, would like to tell society, <em>please support us in doing category theory, it's not just fun to us, it's important for everyone</em>. I'm fully with you on this. But there's a right way to do it, and overpromising, in the slightly longer term, hurts us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am not speaking on your behalf, I am using "we" to speak on the community's behalf.  A community is not simply the collection of people in it, just like a human is not just the collection of their cells, and when you say "Cecil is happy" you are not saying that every single one of their cells is happy.</p>
<p>I think that anyone who is in the ACT community and who has been around long enough and is connected enough to be attuned to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_consciousness">collective consciousness</a> should be able to use the pronoun "we" to describe their impression of the community's feelings, just like if I know a male friend well enough I should be able to use the pronoun "he" to describe my impression of his feelings.</p>
<p>Of course, I understand that the people in this community are mathematicians and like things really precise, so I might have to really narrow down exactly what I mean by "we", "collective consciousness", etc. in order for it to fly.</p>
<p>As for overpromising about appied category theory's power, I do see the concern here.  I probably will edit some of the wording, in ways such as<br>
"We know that applied category theory is powerful stuff, capable of immense good as well as immense harm."<br>
-&gt;<br>
"We strongly suspect that applied category theory is powerful stuff, capable of immense good as well as immense harm.</p>

The specifics of the mathematics and the kinds of clients it seems he might have are not the point, but the dedication and client-focused attitude that he's worked <em>really hard</em> to establish as part of his reputation. </p>
<p>Compare these endorsements <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/endorsements/">https://www.johndcook.com/blog/endorsements/</a> to your own position <a href="https://meygerjos.com/research">https://meygerjos.com/research</a> or <a href="https://meygerjos.com/consultation">https://meygerjos.com/consultation</a></p>
<p>Please take this in the best possible spirit of hoping you are successful in your mathematical career. I haven't commented publicly much on specifics, but you seem to be willing to take what seems like hard advice in good faith. I certainly offer it in such a way.</p>

<p>Yes I understand that I won't get as many clients this way, but I am only intending to work part-time anyway.  Just a few good clients would be enough.  Besides, applied category theory doesn't really lend itself to quick results, it is a long process by nature, and I don't want to either a) advertise falsely or b) end up doing "applied category theory lite" where I call it applied category theory but really it's more like "category-themed applied math".</p>

<p>the attitude is well-represented in the community (especially among influential community members), such that even those who do not personally hold the attitude have to deal with it in others, and such that major community decisions commonly reflect the attitude</p>

<p>which still elevates you to a spokeperson of the ACT community, which you are not, despite being a member I respect.</p>
<p>IMO the correct to proceed would be to (1) claim things in <em>your</em> personal name, using <em>I</em> and (2) say you personally spoke with other people that share your views and concerns, without claiming they are a majority or influential, maybe linking to other people's content that agrees with what you say.</p>

<p>Like, you are putting together many things different people did talk about, but the narrative seems entirely yours, especially re restricting access to ACT <em>a la</em> AGI doomers. I don't agree with that and I have never heard anybody else talking about it.</p>

<p>Instead, I've heard (and I share) other's people concerns that this might harm the perception of the ACT community, and that you shouldn't entitle yourself to zeitgeist interpreter.</p>

<p>In psychology there is a phenomenon where one gets better results influencing people's behavior if one phrases communication in terms of "I" rather than "You": I feel bad when dinner goes cold vs you make dinner go cold by coming home late.  You-messages immediately put the other person on the defensive.  Similarly, with a "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_we">royal we</a>" the audience is immediately put on the defensive: do they self-identify as part of your "we" or not?  As a matter of scientific writing, unless you are referring to a group of authors of size &gt; 1, 'we' creates more ambiguity than it clarifies.  (fwiw I also find polemics off-putting in a professional context, but support free speech rabidly)</p>

<p>I'm starting a weeklong meditation retreat with no tech access except in emergencies. I'll address these comments afterwards. Feel free to keep commenting if you want and I'll catch up on everything after the retreat. I just did a Google search for "applied category theory" and my website didn't come up in many pages so I don't think you'll have to worry much about my website harming the perception of the ACT community. The vast majority of the traffic to my site actually seems to have been coming from this very thread</p>
