<p>There is a tragic irony in life: there are things for which we know not of their definition, but we learn about them through perception. We then try to come up with principles through our empirical evidence in a vain effort to explain things. True enough, the less we observe the less accurate our principles are. And this is deeply ironic because no matter what, our observations can never be complete. I.e. the Yoneda lemma, in its full generality, is beyond our grasp. Now, the irony being tragic depends on the existence of someone with complete access to observations, but let's not touch on that.</p>
<p>Before I got into CT I always thought math only care about well-defined objects and their properties. In an observationally unclear world, math could be this sanctum of  well-foundedness that can give some semblance of order, of security, I thought. I couldn't have been more wrong. Definition vs observation, composition vs decomposition, structure vs destruction, this is not just a duality, it's an eternal conflict!</p>
<p>Strangely enough, I've come to appreciate and embrace this seemingly fundamental duality. Which is perhaps  why I'm so into algebras and coalgebras, monads and comonads, distributive laws of one over the other. Distributive laws prove that observation and structure can co-exist, that behavior may arise compositionally through structure. But, just like in real life, you can never know if there's order hidden in the chaos.</p>
<p>Understanding this duality has been one of the most important lessons I could ever have, one that changed my viewpoint on Life, the Universe and Everything.</p>

<p>A lot of  'binary' operations are actually n-ary operations for all natural n. Thinking of ternary operations is difficult, but so is thinking of binary operations that aren't associative!</p>

<p>Yeah, I wanted to say something like this. A monoid is not really about its binary and nullary operators, but rather its ability to handle lists of inputs in a uniform way (in the sense that it doesn't look to see how many elements the list has, or anything like that).</p>

<p>One ternary <em>relation</em> that is pretty convincing (and might actually be related to heaps) is betweenness: the relation of a point belonging to the line segment between two others. IIRC, you can axiomatize affine space using just this relation.</p>

<p>Of course I agree, but I think I mean the question in a loose "change hearts and minds" sense, that might get people to consider researching certain ternary operations as important.</p>

<p>Between a shape having an inside and an outside, and an arrow having a pointy end and a feathery end, it's hard to imagine trialities ever being as important as dualities</p>

<p>VERY vague thought here, but there is a third element hiding in all of these: in the first, the boundary of the shape itself, and in the second, the arrow itself. I feel like we might at some point move from “object-level manipulations” (e.g. take a binary product of these two things) to “statement-level manipulations” (e.g. look at the equality between the arguments of the binary product and its output as a ternary relationship, and treat that as “primitively” as we do the binary operation now)</p>

<p>Hi, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277611">@Todd Trimble</span>!  Great to see you here!  Yes, heaps are a nice way to formalize "groups that have forgotten their origin", a nice alternative to torsors where you need to have a group around to define them.</p>
<p>Some other examples of ternary operations: James Dolan used to like explaining <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_system#Lie_triple_systems" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_system#Lie_triple_systems">Lie triple systems</a>, which are to symmetric spaces as Lie algebras are to Lie groups.</p>
<p>Also there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_system#Jordan_triple_systems" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_system#Jordan_triple_systems">Jordan triple systems</a>, which I forget the deep inner meaning of... I think they're like Jordan algebras that have "forgotten its 1".    It's important to be able to change your mind about which element is the multiplicative unit in a Jordan algebra (sorry if that remark is obscure, I could explain it now that it's coming back to me).</p>
<p>Also there's the <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/octonions/node18.html" title="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/octonions/node18.html">Freudenthal triple system</a>, which is highly specialized: a way to talk about the structure possessed by the smallest irrep of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>E</mi><mn>7</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">E_7</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.83333em;vertical-align:-0.15em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathdefault" style="margin-right:0.05764em;">E</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.30110799999999993em;"><span style="top:-2.5500000000000003em;margin-left:-0.05764em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">7</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.15em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>.   </p>
<p>And generalizing the last two, there are <a href="https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Freudenthal-Kantor_triple_system" title="https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Freudenthal-Kantor_triple_system">Freudenthal-Kantor triple systems</a>, which as you can see have quite noble ambitions.  I don't understand them.</p>

<p>I guess the non-associativity is essential, because otherwise you could just say it's a free semigroup/monoid. The non-associativity means that the ternary operation encodes meaning that isn't obviously divided into an inclusion and a unital binary operation.</p>

<p>I took a look in the wikipedia page for Lie triple systems and I noticed that their second law, which looks like it involves a shifting of sorts, resembles what my idea of a triality would be: If the (informal) principle of duality manifests as "Take a construct represented in a commutative diagram and reverse the arrows to create its dual" in Category Theory, a possible triality would instead involve a shifting operation between three objects (they can be something like "source, target and observer"). Of course, I'd expect that after three shifts I'd be right where I started, much like <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msup><mi mathvariant="double-struck">C</mi><mrow><mi>o</mi><mi>p</mi></mrow></msup><msup><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mrow><mi>o</mi><mi>p</mi></mrow></msup><mo>≡</mo><msup><mi mathvariant="double-struck">C</mi><mrow><mi>o</mi><mi>p</mi></mrow></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex"> (\mathbb{C}^{op})^{op} \equiv \mathbb{C}^{op}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord"><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathbb">C</span></span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.664392em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mathdefault mtight">o</span><span class="mord mathdefault mtight">p</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mclose"><span class="mclose">)</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.664392em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mathdefault mtight">o</span><span class="mord mathdefault mtight">p</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mrel">≡</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68889em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathbb">C</span></span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.664392em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mathdefault mtight">o</span><span class="mord mathdefault mtight">p</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>.

<p>This second law is a mutant version of the "Jacobi identity", which for a binary operation [-,-] says</p>
<p>[a,[b,c]] + [b,[c,a]] + [c,[a,b]] = 0</p>
<p>(we're summing over cyclic permutations). The Jacobi identity holds for Lie algebras.</p>

<p>Aside from the standard universal algebra approach, it might be interesting to view ternary products as actions.  </p>
<p>I mention this because of the unfortunately named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_ternary_ring?wprov=sfti1">planar ternary rings</a> used to parametrize the construction of projective planes.  Folks here know about them, but I hadn't seen them mentioned yet.</p>
<p>This approach seems a little useful for PTRs as it allows us to separate the possibly non-associative product from the simpler operation;<br>

<p>My point is just that we do have some ways of decomposing these things into a more familiar language, at the cost of combinatorics -- instead of just left and right actions we now have to care about three different actions!  I agree it would be great to have a systematic treatment that got specific enough... maybe the above will prove useful eventually.</p>

<p>Does anyone know if projective geometry is a triangulated category?  All I'm familiar with is <a href="https://nforum.ncatlab.org/discussion/450/projective-space-as-a-category">Anders Kock's characterization</a> of three collinear points in a Desaurgesian projective plane as a morphism.</p>
<p>(1) -- why a cross-ratio of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6444em;"></span><span class="mord">1</span></span></span></span>... its a rare as a cross-ratio, due to doubled-up points iirc, though I think it might instead be interpreted that inclusion-exclusion with unsigned measures is the image of the cross ratio under a trivial homomorphism;

<p>I guess the non-associativity is essential, because otherwise you could just say it's a free semigroup/monoid. The non-associativity means that the ternary operation encodes meaning that isn't obviously divided into an inclusion and a unital binary operation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm interested in what you mean by this.  I think I disagree, though maybe the issue turns on what is "obvious".</p>
<p>First, you can have associative ops that don't decompose as an inclusion and a monoid; the truth table for the symmetric system <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">{</mo><mi>a</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>b</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>+</mo><mi>b</mi><mo stretchy="false">}</mo><mo separator="true">;</mo><mtext> </mtext><mi mathvariant="normal">∀</mi><mi>a</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>b</mi><mo>∈</mo><mi mathvariant="double-struck">Z</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><mn>2</mn><mi mathvariant="double-struck">Z</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\{a,b,a+b\}; ~\forall a,b\in\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">{</span><span class="mord mathnormal">a</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">b</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">a</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span><span class="mbin">+</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">b</span><span class="mclose">}</span><span class="mpunct">;</span><span class="mspace nobreak"> </span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord">∀</span><span class="mord mathnormal">a</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">b</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">∈</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathbb">Z</span><span class="mord">/2</span><span class="mord mathbb">Z</span></span></span></span> comes to mind -- we have a monoid but any of the two truth-table-columns are mutually perpendicular, so there is no inclusion from just two of the three that I can see.  It's really the "rank" of the interaction that measures its essential (in)decomposability, not per se the associativity.</p>
<p>But also you can always view a non-associative system (such as a magma action) as a formal retract of its closure under composition, which is of course an associative system; <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>c</mi><msub><mi>l</mi><mo>∘</mo></msub><mo>:</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">M</mi><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">a</mi><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">g</mi><mo>→</mo><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">M</mi><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">o</mi><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">n</mi></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">cl_\circ:{\sf Mag\to Mon}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8444em;vertical-align:-0.15em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">c</span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.01968em;">l</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.1611em;"><span style="top:-2.55em;margin-left:-0.0197em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mbin mtight">∘</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.15em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">:</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8889em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathsf" style="margin-right:0.01389em;">Mag</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">→</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mord mathsf">Mon</span></span></span></span></span></span>.  So, while not a free monoid action, there is exactly one (albiet non-distinct) per magma action, and often computable.  I say "formal" as for very large systems its non-trivial to pick the correct retract among many candidates, but at least one is guaranteed to exist.  (The retract needs to be a partial homomorphism, but cannot be a full hom due to non-associativity so sadly its not an adjoint either.)</p>
<p>In case that is all garbledegook, I am happy to break it out further; a nice example with a unique retract is to take the completion of the subtraction quasigroup of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="double-struck">Z</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><mi>n</mi><mi mathvariant="double-struck">Z</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathbb">Z</span><span class="mord">/</span><span class="mord mathnormal">n</span><span class="mord mathbb">Z</span></span></span></span>.  (The left and right actions yield technically different but isomorphic groups in this case) The group you should obtain is the dihedral group <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>D</mi><mrow><mn>2</mn><mo>⋅</mo><mi>n</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">D_{2\cdot n}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8333em;vertical-align:-0.15em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.02778em;">D</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.3011em;"><span style="top:-2.55em;margin-left:-0.0278em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mtight">2</span><span class="mbin mtight">⋅</span><span class="mord mathnormal mtight">n</span></span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.15em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>; the behavior of the retract is governed by the need for a partial homomorphism that recovers the quasigroup.  </p>
<p>But my point is that IMO the complexity of non-associativity, while it can be a burden, is separate from the complexity of a ternary relation.</p>

<p>There is also the projective harmonic conjugate, a ternary operation that gives the fourth point such that the cross-ratio equals -1. But it can also be used in axiomatic synthetic geometry as a way to define the underlying field operations prior to the definition of the cross-ratio.</p>

<p>I had not seen this thread before! Just wanted to point out that "going beyond dualities" is one of the main themes of my research (here is my website: <a href="https://www.arity.science/">https://www.arity.science/</a>). Some of my collaborators are on this forum actually <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="296322">@Jacques Carette</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="303960">@Joshua Grochow</span> .</p>
<p>We have been investigating ternary algebras of cubic arrays, (semi)heaps and triality over the past couple of years. If anyone would like to chat about these topics, just sent me a DM!</p>

<p>Rota vaguely opined that eventually math is going to move on to take ternary operations seriously.  The same might be said for trialities.  The one really important triality I've put a lot of time into is the <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/octonions/node7.html">triality in 8 dimensions</a>, which underlies the octonions and ultimately superstring theory.   But this seems so exotic and specialized compared to dualities!</p>

<p>Do you know where he opined this? Sounds like a piece I'd like to read...</p>

<p>I don't think he wrote a whole piece on this, probably more like a couple of sentences. I don't remember where he wrote them: maybe somewhere in his books <em>Discrete Thoughts</em> and <em>Indiscrete Thoughts</em>.  They're so much fun that even if  you don't find that remark you'll enjoy yourself.</p>

<p>This is exactly my experience with (semi)heaps! In case it is useful at all, this paper tries to provide some clarity:</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07203v1">Biunit pairs in semiheaps and associated semigroups</a></p>
<p>In this paper we generalize the well-known correspondence between pointed heaps and groups (involuted semigroups) to pointed semiheaps and a certain class of semigroups equipped with a map (not necessarily a homomorphism, generalizing an involution that we call a switch) such that:</p>
