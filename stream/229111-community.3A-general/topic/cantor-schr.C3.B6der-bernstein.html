<p>PROPOSITION. A topos is boolean if and only if it satisfies <br>
(CSB*) if f:A-&gt;B and g:B-&gt;A are monics<br>
           then there is an iso h:A-&gt;B <br>
            such that for every x in A holds<br>
            h(x) = f(x) or h(x) = g^{-1}(x)</p>
<p>PROOF of the "if" part: Let X be a subobject of Y. We use (CSB*) to<br>
construct its complement. Define<br>
    A = YxN <br>
    B = X+(YxN)</p>
<p>(where N is the object of natural numbers). Let f:A--&gt;B be the<br>
inclusion, and g:B--&gt;A the unique arrow which maps X into the first<br>
copy of Y in A, while it takes the copies of Y contained in B into the<br>
second one, the third one and so on. (Formally, g is defined using the<br>
universal property of coproducts, and the structure of N.) It is clear<br>
that both f and g are monics.</p>
<p>By (CSB*), there is a bijection h:A--&gt;B with h(x)=f(x) or<br>
h(x)=g^{-1}(x). This means that the union of<br>
    C = {z | h(z)=f(z)} and<br>
    D = {z | h(z)=g^{-1}(z)}<br>
covers A. On the other hand, the definitions of f and g imply that C<br>
and D are disjoint. So they are complements in A. By pulling back C and D<br>
along the inclusion of Y iso Yx{0} in A, we get two complementary<br>
subobjects of Y. The claim is now that the intersection (pullback) X'<br>
of D and Yx{0} is isomorphic to X -- so that the intersection of C and<br>
Yx{0} yields the complement of X in Y.</p>
<p>First of all, each element &lt;y,n&gt; of D must surely be in the image of<br>
g. Thus, if &lt;y,0&gt; is in D, then y must be in X. So X' is contained in<br>
Xx{0}. The other way around, since h(C) is contained in f(C), the<br>
intersection in B of X and h(C) must be empty. Therefore, X must be<br>
contained in h(D): indeed, h is an iso, and the direct images h(C) and<br>
h(D) must be complementary in B. But h(D) is contained in<br>
g^{-1}(D). So X is in g^{-1}(D), i.e. g(X) is in D. Hence, Xx{0}=g(X)<br>
is contained in X'.</p>

<p>if you want to look at a constructive version of CSB, decidability does not seem to help, but if you assume that your the two sets, injected into one another, are totally ordered, like for instance programs of some programming languages, then the CSB becomes hartley rogers' theorem that every two acceptable enumerations are isomorphic.</p>

<p>Well, I do see now that Andrej Bauer points to that paper in <em>his</em> answer (I missed it before by not scrolling past your question and dusko's answer), but if that's what dusko was "replying to", then it was easy to miss. The only possible reference to Andrej's answer I see would have to be the indirect allusion "if we go back even further". </p>
<p>In other words: gimme a break!</p>
