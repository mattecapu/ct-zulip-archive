<p>It's been a long time since I had this volume of interaction with people online. It's nice to have an outlet and a connection to this community, but the old insecurities of not knowing what tone people are taking or whether anyone actually cares about the crafted details of your messages were not missed. Also the ever-niggling questions of whether this is more procrastination than socialising gnaws away at me...</p>

<p>Maybe the following suggestions could help:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use emojis! I know it looks stupid but it's probably the best way we have to convey the "tone" of a sentence</li>
<li>Try to pay attention to people style. For instance, ending sentences with a full stop gives me a feeling of "seriousness/being pissed", but I am noticing that some people do that consistently, and in this case I know it's just a matter of their personal writing style, and not that I am annoying them (at least I hope so)</li>
<li>If you feel like procrastinating, use this platform to do research. This is what I'm trying to do in <a class="stream-topic" data-stream-id="229156" href="/#narrow/stream/229156-applied-category-theory/topic/cryptography">#applied category theory &gt; cryptography</a> , for instance. I know many people are not used to do research "in public", and prefer to make their results public only when they have a paper, but I am finding this open approach really refreshing: There are no attribution problems since everything is public and moreover everyone interested can chime in and add something useful, making research more productive. All in all, this shouldn't be considered just as a place to socialize, but as a substitute to everyday working practice in these trying times (especially if you are self-isolating)</li>
</ol>

<p>I guess you're from a younger generation, Fab, if you think that ending sentences with a period means "seriousness/being pissed".  For me the lack of punctuation signals "not giving a damn", sort of like leaving your shoelaces untied.  But okay, maybe not everyone likes periods at the end of sentences.  At least we know what's going on now.</p>

<p>Yes, it's a bit weird. I think it depends on the kind of people I used to hang out with digitally 20 or something years ago. Back then no one in the IRC channels I lurked into was ending sentences with a period (unless they were pissed for something). Clearly I got this kind of imprinting. It's weird because in non-chat written text (forums, papers, books, etc) I'd consider a sentence ending without a period as totally savage :D</p>

<p>...It's actually fascinating how netiquette rules evolve in weird ways. For instance, I have the tendency to capitalize everything: Even on my pc my folders names are all capitalized. 90% of my developer friends absolutely hate this, and put everything lowercase. It seems to be a widespread habit among programmers, and it drives me nuts</p>

<p>I think the same thing applies to using capitals; all-lowercase and stops-indicated-by-message-ends-unless-internal-to-the-message is a norm I, as part of a younger generation, I guess, am used to. Including periods can be taken to imply that you went to extra effort to end your sentence, instead of using a message-end, which would have done just as well! It can feel as though the writer wants this to be the last word on the subject, and wants you to know it.</p>
<p>But I definitely think it also depends on the form of the words and thoughts involved: long paragraphs are maybe expected to have punctuation breaks, so it’s not unusual if they also end with punctuation. Plus, there are many other opportunities in a paragraph to gauge tone! (Like that exclamation point just there, or the way I tend to word things—is it reflective of a person sharing their thoughts and engaging in conversation, e.g. “I think”, or am I simply stating facts bluntly?)</p>
<p>I think the “period -&gt; terseness” inference applies mainly when messages are short and convey one particular point. Then it can be read as condescension, because of the inferred sense that this is all that needs to be said on the subject!</p>
