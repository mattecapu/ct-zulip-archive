<p>let's say I'm comfortable talking about group theory, but know nearly nothing about topology as such. If I'm being taught about limits and the first example is from group theory, but the second is about topological spaces, I might just not catch the pattern, and then it becomes harder to follow everything. If that happens enough, you might just throw your hands up and say "it's abstract nonsense!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are plenty of detractors of CT I've met who work in group theory, which is funny because they do use homological algebra. I think it's because many workers in that area work on very specific concrete problems that may not need the level of abstraction that CT offers.</p>

<p>Personally, resistance to CT has always felt like the an echo within mathematics of the inertia that exists at all levels of society against new ways of understanding things that are already familiar. People don't realise when what they're doing is "secretly" category theory because category theory feels foreign to them.<br>
My own solution to this issue as a researcher is twofold. First, to work long and hard enough that one catches a big fish: a result which has eluded algebraists or geometers or number theorists working classically, but whose obstacles are circumvented by the abstraction of category theory. Rehashing known results or categorifying classical methods and proofs is (usually) straightforward but necessary and time-consuming work even once the "right" abstract context has been identified. It's only after that has been done that one can leverage the advantages of the more abstract framework, which is why until the net gets pulled in, mathematicians in the target fields are difficult to sway.<br>
The second aspect is to teach and share the joy of category theory with any keen young mathematician, computer scientist, or student in another discipline. Categories abound, but it is only by introducing them to students and budding researchers that the necessary work mentioned above can be completed, in order for them to emerge (and ultimately be taught) as the modern foundation of mathematics that many of us in this community believe they should be.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>If your mental image of a morphism is a function of some sort between sets with some structure, then it's indeed unnatural to reason without using points - at least if you imagine a set as made of points, as most of us do.   But if you think of a morphism as an action like "pour water in the pot", "put the carrots in the pot", etc., then we naturally reason using composition and tensoring of morphisms without points.  So, it's good to teach people examples of categories where the morphisms aren't functions!</p>

<p>I agree with those.   </p>
<p>I think the <em>psychological</em> reason many people dislike category theory is that it makes them feel dumb.  This is also the reason many people dislike mathematics.  In this way category theory is a kind of "metamathematics": it's a kind of mathematics that even makes mathematicians feel dumb.</p>

<p>One reason people feel dumb when learning category theory is that it forces you to think in new ways.  You have to literally rewire your neurons, and this creates a kind of ache in the mind.</p>

<p>Another reason is that category theorists use phrases like "just", as in "the Eilenberg-Moore category of a monad is just a lax equalizer".    This sort of phrase always means: "once you understand things this new way, it will allow you to see what you knew in as a special case of something that's simple in its own way."   But it makes you feel dumb at first.</p>

<p>If your mental image of a morphism is a function of some sort between sets with some structure, then it's indeed unnatural to reason without using points - at least if you imagine a set as made of points, as most of us do.   But if you think of a morphism as an action like "pour water in the pot", "put the carrots in the pot", etc., then we naturally reason using composition and tensoring of morphisms without points.  So, it's good to teach people examples of categories where the morphisms aren't functions!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As someone coming to this area with more of controls and signal processing background, a lot  of my intuition already comes from composition. The wiring diagrams look a lot like formal generalizations of block diagrams which represent compositions. Is there anyone else from such a background and do they have commentary on the experience, as it compares to someone starting from reasoning about categories in terms of maps in point set topology?</p>

<p>"mathematical objects are completely determined by their relationships to other objects."</p>
<p>This statement is wonderful but also interesting in that complex systems science takes this as an assumption about the world without necessarily having formal support for the claim, and in particular model based systems engineering practice also requires this assumption (again irrespective of its formal support).</p>
<p>It is compelling that this is a basic result of CT.</p>

<p>This makes sense. However, I find that category theory interests me at least partially <em>because</em> it makes me feel dumb. I prefer to think of it as providing a sense of wonder: there is so much more to math than I thought, and it's all so much more connected than I guessed.</p>

<p>I have a very low understanding of CT but had read discussions in old books and papers by N Rashevsky and R Rosen in theoreticl biology, and P Kainen and Ehresmann in neuroscience, and looked up a few things by  S MacLane and had a paper given to me by an ex-grad student of Lawvere.  I am mostly interested in applications to  ecological, chemical reaction, economic, and social networks, but i am more familiar with the approach to these using graph theory and statistical physics.   The 'dialect' of CT is quite different --it may be like learning how to build a rocket when all you need is a bicycle.</p>

<p>it's all about marginal costs... i could take a space shuttle to the moon, but if I can have a worm hole generator, i'd probably test it by going to the moon before I used it to go to alpha centauri.  (here CT is the worm hole generator)</p>
<p>Speaking of which,  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span> again provided the answers i sought above by providing more mappings of CT to concepts dynamical systems and control engineers know well  with this: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.05625.pdf" title="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.05625.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.05625.pdf</a> and I am cutting my teeth on analogue circuits because they already have wiring diagrams and I already know how to make filters and controllers by composing primitive processes.</p>
<p>Circuits and signal processing are great entry points for engineers (as opposed to mathematicians and computer scientists) to CT. I am firmly of the opinion (now) that we need CT in Cyberphysical Systems precisely because of the challenge of composing higher and higher order systems with less and less control of the associated subsystems. At that point the only thing you can hope to model (or design) is structure.</p>
<p>Today's big realization (conjecture, actually) is that Lyapunov stability can be thought of as the property that the system's structure is isomorphic to a passive system with the Lyapunov function as its notion of energy.</p>

<p>I think what people feel foreign about is CT for CT's sake. Homological algebra is part of CT, but most people don't think that, because it feels like a concrete calculating tool.</p>
<p>And this isn't restricted to CT either. Set theory has the same problem: you literally use set-theoretic notation every day, and yet most people don't care for set theory itself.</p>

So, a certain line of research in algebra is blocked until we choose axioms extending ZFC that settle this question, and hopefully others, one way or the other.</p>
<p>But it seems not many algebraists are motivated to dig in this direction.   For one thing, it would require a lot of work!</p>

<p>Yup, and unless that work is rewarded, it won't be done, or you'll get workarounds.</p>
<p>In real life, if a certain line of research is blocked, people will route around it and ignore it. At least the career-minded ones would.</p>

<p>Let me rephrase my question so that it's clearer: is there a way for you to translate the analysis you've done into CT terms? Not another strategy or another approach, but just rewriting all the analysis you've actually done in the language of CT.</p>

<p>Hi Gabo! What sort of undergraduate degree is seven years long… <em>on the average</em>? And if it has an inflexible curriculum, which aspect makes the time vary about the average?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(This is not very on-topic now that the conversation has been moved from "Introduce Youerself!" to "learning CT", but I'm answering here because I don't know where else I would and also I find it fun to share how different our degree system is. Ignore this if you don't care about university in Argentina!)</p>
<p>Hi! It's as <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276424">@Rongmin Lu</span>  points out (I feel understood!). Our system is similar to the pre-Bologna European one, or so they say. It might sound weird: for engeneering, for example, the degree is literally "Engineer". For most disciplines, the standard degree is the Licentiate degree, but its length also varies from one discipline to the other. In my case, the Physics Licentiate degree is 6 years in paper, though the usual is 7.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why the time varies, but as a clarification, what I meant by "inflexible curriculum" is that you have almost no choice about what classes you must take, and not that you are required to complete the degree in a fixed amount of time (which you aren't). I would say the main reason for the variability is that most classes have very hard final exams, which you are not required to take at the end of the semester. Instead, you can take them any time as soon as you pass the rest of the class. It's almost universal for people to accumulate some of those, because you need a lot of time to prepare well for them and there's a balance to be kept between how much "final debt" you have and how good you want your grades to be. Keep in mind that for all these classes I'm referring to, the final exam determines 100% of your grade.</p>
<p>There are other things too, such as the fact that there's no tuition of any sort for undergraduate degrees (at least for public universities, which are the only ones you'll care about anyway if you're interested in Physics or Mathematics). All in all it's a different world around here <span aria-label="slight smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="slight smile">:slight_smile:</span></p>

<p>Cool! About setting up a complex systems stream, my current understanding is that a lot of the work currently going under the name of Applied Category Theory would fit pretty well the name "complex systems from a CT viewpoint". So I'm not sure what could be the purpose of a separate stream. Perhaps I could see a need for translating questions and ideas back and forth between some established "complex systems" vocabulary and ACT, but I'm not sure.

<p>Wow. When I was looking for a proof of the Yoneda Lemma that was clear enough for me to implement, the best I found was by the Unapologetic Mathematician (<a href="https://unapologetic.wordpress.com/2007/06/06/yonedas-lemma/" title="https://unapologetic.wordpress.com/2007/06/06/yonedas-lemma/">https://unapologetic.wordpress.com/2007/06/06/yonedas-lemma/</a>). This doesn't include the naturality conditions that are not always regarded as being part of the lemma proper. It ends with the claim that the two procedures it constructs are "clearly" inverses. I hope that means that I can assert that and the compiler will auto verify it. That should be the definition of "clearly" for some definition of "compiler".</p>

<p>Exactly. That's probably how the thought process of many analysts who've encountered CT ended. They may play around it for a while, but once they got around to considering what I've just asked you to consider, they'd inevitably come to the same conclusion you just did: it sounds hard.</p>
<p>And that's why people avoid CT. Not because it's hard, but because it doesn't offer any clear advantage over the tools they currently have in their field. Yet.</p>

<p>Your system follows the pre-Bologna Spanish system, which is similar to the other systems in continental Europe. In particular:</p>

<p>I'm not sure which sense of tuition you meant here -- fees, or classes outside of lectures -- but that's true in Germany AFAIK. The final exam determining 100% of your grade was also true in the old continental system, and perhaps even of the Oxbridge universities.</p>

<p>Agreed, but it'd be nicer if more people worked on this neglected aspect of CT. Either to develop the capability, or to hit a brick wall so that we can reasonably say, "Well, that's something CT can't do".</p>

<p>I believe it's misleading to think CT can be useful to (say) analysts only if we are able to prove estimates using categorical tools. That's actually the most useless way CT could enter a field, because it doesn't add anything new and it recasts everything in a language most people there don't understand, let alone master. Eventually, people will 'meh' it and go back to their usual methods. <br>
What CT is great at is unraveling patterns. This enables cross-pollination between subjects, and that's where we should go looking for new results. If I can show the analyst I can open new fronts to attack a problem, using ideas from analogous but not-yet-related parts of math, this might at least sound like honest, working mathematics, and not just general abstract nonsense.</p>

<p>I believe it's misleading to think CT can be useful to (say) analysts only if we are able to prove estimates using categorical tools. That's actually the most useless way CT could enter a field, because it doesn't add anything new and it recasts everything in a language most people there don't understand, let alone master. Eventually, people will 'meh' it and go back to their usual methods. <br>
What CT is great at is unraveling patterns. This enables cross-pollination between subjects, and that's where we should go looking for new results. If I can show the analyst I can open new fronts to attack a problem, using ideas from analogous but not-yet-related parts of math, this might at least sound like honest, working mathematics, and not just general abstract nonsense.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You need both, and Grothendieck is the historical example. CT probably enabled him to transfer the thinking in functional analysis, which he acquired while working under Schwartz and Dieudonne, into algebraic geometry. </p>
<p>(A brief timeline: </p>
<ul>
<li>CT was initiated in 1942-1945</li>
<li>Grothendieck did functional analysis in 1950-1953</li>
<li>He switched to algebraic geometry by 1957)</li>
</ul>
<p>This cross-pollination changed the face of algebraic geometry, but it also recast the tools of algebraic geometry in a language that many people there today still don't fully understand. On top of that, it improved those tools and corrected errors that were generated by the previous techniques.</p>
<p>Algebraic geometers could have said "meh" and carried on with their old intuitive techniques, but they didn't, because their old tools had been replaced with better ones. That's why they couldn't have said "meh".</p>
<p>I don't see the prospect of CT doing that for analysis yet, because the current tools are pretty rigorous and powerful, and what CT can do now seems to pale in comparison.</p>

<p>What some analysts (and some group theorists, and other detractors) who are engaged in research into concrete problems don't really appreciate about CT is that they don't really feel that the capabilities of the tools in their domain have been exhausted yet to justify bringing in the big machinery of CT. They don't see the need for "cross-pollination between subjects", because many of them don't work between subjects. </p>

<p>I agree.</p>
<p>But I'd argue it's still a big gap in our knowledge if we can't (or don't know if we can) simulate analysis using CT. I'm probably woefully under-informed, since <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="276625">Joachim Kock</span> just contributed a reference upstream, but then perhaps if we can somehow already do analysis using CT, it's not really common knowledge and perhaps we should make that knowledge more common.</p>

<p>Category theory can be good in figuring out patterns and straightening out concepts in analysis.   One very simple and fundamental example: instead of metric spaces, it's often better to use Lawvere metric space.</p>

Of course not; any particular person just has to choose whether they want to study abelian groups or nonabelian groups.  That's the only thing it can possibly mean to "settle this question".</p>
<p>Similarly, the answer to the Whitehead problem is yes in some toposes and no in in others.  That settles the question; now anyone can choose for themselves whether they want to work in Whitehead-toposes or non-Whitehead-toposes.</p>

<p>That's a nice way to look at it, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276777">@Mike Shulman</span>, thanks! </p>
<p>That's what I was referring to when I say people will look for workarounds. </p>
<p>The classical example is the insolubility of the quintic. Sure, now we have group theory and we can study groups and talk about <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mtext>Symmetries</mtext><mtext>TM</mtext></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex"> \textrm{Symmetries}^{\textrm{TM}} </annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1.109001em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord text"><span class="mord textrm">Symmetries</span></span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.914561em;"><span style="top:-3.1362300000000003em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord text mtight"><span class="mord textrm mtight">TM</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>  every time we talk to the press. </p>
<p>However, there's another school that says, hang on, is this really a no-go theorem, the be-all and end-all on quintics, or can there be other ways of solving certain classes of quintics? It turns out the answer is yes.</p>
<p>When many people resist CT, they tend to think of the first approach: look at all the symmetries, isn't maths beautiful, blablabla. CT can do the second, of course, and many detractors take the second approach: more concrete and constrained problems. But these kinds of problems are not usually arenas where CT, right now, seems to perform as well as the existing domain-specific techniques. </p>
<p>The point I want to make is, why, and can we do better?</p>

<p>And in the case of groups we feel perfectly comfy with doing this.  But when it comes to Whitehead's problem I fear <em>most</em> mathematicians would tend to say "oh, it's undecidable in ZFC, I won't mess with this issue any further".  That's the way in which research gets blocked.</p>

<p>If my fear is misguided - if plenty of mathematicians are willing to extend ZFC with extra axioms to settle Whitehead's conjecture one way or another, or choose a topos in which the conjecture either holds or doesn't... well, then I'm happy to hear that!</p>

<p>Yes, this thread was about psychological resistance to category theory... and someone (Rongmin?) compared it to the psychological resistance that mathematicians have learning set theory beyond the basics.  I feel the two cases are quite different, but still worth comparing.   I raised Whitehead's Conjecture as an example of a question that <em>could</em> push algebraists into learning some serious set theory, but as far I can tell, for the most part <em>hasn't</em>.  </p>
<p>For example, I don't see books on homological algebra saying "In this chapter we'll assume the axiom of constructiblity, so that <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">E</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">x</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">t</mi></mrow><mn>1</mn></msup><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi mathvariant="double-struck">Z</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{Ext}^1(A,\mathbb{Z}) = 0</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1.137338em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">E</span><span class="mord mathrm">x</span><span class="mord mathrm">t</span></span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.887338em;"><span style="top:-3.1362300000000003em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">1</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathdefault">A</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.16666666666666666em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathbb">Z</span></span><span class="mclose">)</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mrel">=</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.64444em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord">0</span></span></span></span> implies <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">A</span></span></span></span> is free and also..."</p>
<p>I'm sure <em>someone</em> must be doing research like this, but I feel it's not in the mainstream.  My feeling is that for most algebraists, the perceived pain of learning serious set theory outweighs the perceived advantages of being able to march ahead exploring algebra in multiple axiom systems extending ZFC.</p>

<p>I think the difference is that in general mathematics, axioms of group theory are understood to be chosen to fix a framework with many models/examples, while the axioms of set theory are understood to be chosen to do the opposite: Capture and thus pin down one example/model. Logical categoricity is in contrast to abstraction, and thus an abstract algebraist works in a different framework than a set theorist that fine-tunes his theory to his aesthetic.<br>
The "real world" was pinned down by the logicans 100 years ago, promoted as providing the monic substance for other theories. This relation makes it so that their axioms of group theory or manifolds, etc. are not understood as expressions capturing mathematical objects out of the aether, but are seemingly just conditions that select from among the objects in the "real world." In other words, for the so called practical mathematician, to specify groups and other axioms at the beginning of a mathematical text is not conceiving mathematical objects in a broad sense, but instead the act of stating the axioms is merely the act of declaring the focus of the investigation at hand. In that mindset, to choose axioms which are known to concern the people who provided rules of set theory may seems as breaking away from the "real world," the actual mathematical truth.</p>

<p>Right!   It's fun to imagine people thinking that the axioms of a group have one true model.  Why do they do it for the axioms of set theory?   Something about the foundations of mathematics drives people crazy - maybe it's the word "foundations".  I prefer the word "entrances".  A building can have many entrances.</p>

<p>Well the people that go crazy at least must have had enough exposure to come to different conclusions. When it comes to foundational theories, I think the issue is not just that non-logic minded mathematicans think there is "one true" theory among others, but that people don't even think the others are notions that can be made concrete. E.g., that studying "set that can contain themselves" were similar to studying that one algorithm that solves the Halting problem.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span> But people don't usually think about non-standard models of natural numbers, even though those also exist, at least in first-order logic.  In second order logic, you can uniquely define the natural numbers as well as various set theories.  In fact this happens all the time doing math in Coq, which is higher order.</p>

<p>That's a good illustration of how axiomatization is done to taste: sometimes I want to axiomatize a class of things, sometimes I want  to axiomatize one thing uniquely.  And whether I can get what I want depends not only on the 'things' in an intuitive sense, but on the logic and meta-logic I'm working in.  FWIW, I think the resistance to CT from programmers stems not so much from the fact that the CT axioms are somehow harder to understand than say group theory, but that programmers would resist group theory as well, and since category theory is more applicable to functional programming that most other axiomatic algebraic theories, it is category theorists stuck bearing the burden of proof in that domain.</p>

<p>So despite not believing in the "true" model of PA, you do believe that PA is consistent.  [Since you assert that  it has "many different models".]   That's a curious combination of scepticism and belief.  I wonder what convinces you of Con(PA).   Gentzen's proof by epsilon_0 induction, or the double negation proof that PA is consistent relative to Heyting arithmetic? </p>

<p>A "workaround", as I understand it, is a bypass, or a routing, <em>around</em> an obstruction. We may eventually understand something deeper, the obstruction may eventually shrivel from a mountain to a pebble, but there is no denying the obstruction still remains in the examples that have come up.

<p>Sure.  Let me give one parting shot: a workaround is defined as "a method for overcoming a problem or limitation in a program or system."  But when you deeply understand what is going on, it frequently happens that the situation is no longer viewed as a "problem" or a "limitation", but rather an opportunity to discover new realms of beautiful mathematics.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="275920">John Baez</span> But people don't usually think about non-standard models of natural numbers, even though those also exist, at least in first-order logic.

</blockquote>
<p>I think the notion that you can uniquely define the natural numbers in set theory is a kind of illusion.  There's indeed a theorem saying that in ZFC there's a unique-up-to-isomorphism 'standard' model of the natural numbers - I'm not denying that.  But there are many different models of ZFC, and if we look at the 'standard' model of the natural numbers <em>in these different models</em> we find that different sentences in the language of arithmetic hold.   In short, the ambiguity has just been pushed back one notch.</p>
<p>A similar thing is true for second-order logic.</p>

<p>I don't find it curious in the case of groups, because I can see specific nonisomorphic examples of groups, such as S_4 and S_7.  By contrast, I'm not aware of any examples of PA models other than those that are derived from my a priori belief (based on intuition) in the true model.  This leaves me unable to understand why someone would believe in the existence of PA models without believing in the true model, unless they derive that belief from a prior belief in Con(PA), which prompted my question of where <em>that</em> belief would come from.</p>

<p>Since from one PA model you can construct many others, as soon as you believe in one PA model you must believe in lots of them.  But once you realize that, it's natural to come to suspect that whatever PA model you started from might have been constructed from some other one, so there's no reason to expect it to be the "true" on either.  (I believe this is a PA version of Hamkin's argument for the "Wellfoundedness Mirage" axiom of the set-theoretic multiverse.)</p>
<p>Compare to the theory of relativity.  In Galilean physics we may imagine we are in the global rest frame and other frames of reference are moving with respect to us.  But in Einsteinian physics we realize that the moving reference frames (at least the inertial ones) appear, to those inside them, identical to our global rest frame.  Then it's hard to avoid taking the step of realizing that in fact there is no such thing as a "global rest frame", since from the perspective of other frames it is moving.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276072">@sarahzrf</span> Doesn't that break when you introduce electromagnetism?  Since all speeds in a moving Galilean frame are additive in the direction of motion, I thought that you could distinguish the global rest frame as the one in which the speed of light is the same in all directions.  (Of course, I'm sure that various other things about electromagnetism also break in Galilean physics.)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes.  For example, ones that prove not-Con(PA).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>as soon as you believe in one PA model you must believe in lots of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes.  And where does that initial belief come from?  From my intuition of the actual totality of natural numbers.  I can just about imagine doubting that intuition.  But then I would have no model, rather than many models, and Con(PA) would be thrown into doubt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But once you realize that, it's natural to come to suspect that whatever PA model you started from might have been constructed from some other one,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I cannot understand this.  Your sentence seems to assume that I did actually start with a PA model, i.e. I was not mistaken in thinking that I did.  That your phrase "whatever PA model you started with" denotes.  So let's call it the "true model".  Or the "starting model" if it makes you happier.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>so there's no reason to expect it to be the "true" on either.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me take this further.  Does your multiverse of equally legitimate models include ones that validate not-Con(PA), even though you believe Con(PA)?  Or does it include only models that validate the same sentences as the starting model, such as Con(PA)?  (Your relativistic analogy appears to suggest the latter.)  Or neither?</p>

<p>No, I never really rendered a judgement on whether these proofs are "acceptable".   I don't know what it would <em>mean</em> for me to "accept  PRA + epsilon-induction as valid".

<p>And it's probably no coincidence that CT in CS finds the most use in architectural issues in software development. This is probably ACT's greatest strength, and well may it capitalise on that to spread the knowledge developed in CS to other disciplines. But there are other areas in which CT isn't as strong, and perhaps some people may like to look at that and build CT up in those areas.</p>

Mathematical existence only makes sense within a framework, like first-order logic or dependent type theory, in which there is a quantifier called "there exists" that can be proven to hold.  But I can sort of imagine what it might be like to believe that mathematical objects exist Platonically, and I was trying to argue from that perspective.</p>
<p>Clearly <em>you</em> believe that models of PA exist because of your intuition for "the" totality of natural numbers.  But what I'm saying is that <em>another person</em> might believe in lots of models of PA for different reasons.  They might have an intuition for "a" totality of natural numbers admitting more than one possible model, that compels belief as strongly as your intuition for a unique totality of natural numbers does for you.</p>

<p>I enjoy the theological parallels that could be drawn from that last comment. Personally I think this is why foundations drive people crazy: it's because once you dig down into them it's impossible to ignore the old bones of philosophy that are revealed, and at that point there are no fundamentally right answers. The best you can do is to build a framework that seems(!) robust enough to carry the maths you want to do on top of it.

<p>Yes, most people want to just do the maths on top of that framework, not worry about whether or not the planet would suddenly vanish beneath their feet! That's kind of what <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="281274">Nikolaj Kuntner</span> was pointing out <a href="#narrow/stream/229111-general/topic/Shaky.20foundations/near/192696112" title="#narrow/stream/229111-general/topic/Shaky.20foundations/near/192696112">here</a>: many mathematicians fix a set of axioms and proceed from there using tools that were built within that framework.</p>
<p>Another thing that I've found that puts people off CT: some proponents don't understand that many working mathematicians aren't trying to organise stuff, they just want to calculate stuff. And CT <em>at the moment</em> isn't very suited to perform the kinds of calculations that they need. </p>
<p>It's like, I want to know that 1+1=2, and you show me several hundred pages of Principia Mathematica. That's not very appealing, to put it mildly.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276699">@Paul Blain Levy</span> What do you mean by "counterexample"?  Do you mean some collections of actual objects in the world that gave different answers when grouped in different ways?  I would be very surprised by that, because the formal system of the natural numbers, although it is only an idea rather than a Platonic entity that exists in the same sense as apples do, has been designed to be a good model of the real world, so that we expect its conclusions to be applicable to the real world.</p>

<p>There's a paper by Sergei Artemov (The Provability of Consistency, I think) that argues that the Gödel statement of consistency is actually not appropriate for capturing what we mean. I.E. by quantifying over the natural numbers, it must hold uniformly in all models of arithmetic, including the non-standard ones.</p>
<p>So, possibly one way to think about not-Con(PA) models is that they also contain non-standard notions of proof that you would not really agree are real proofs, but you've tricked yourself into equating them with the normal proofs you think about. This angle is also kind of similar to some work on formal systems for ultrafinitism. They include 'inconsistent' axioms, but the proofs you'd have to construct to demonstrate the inconsistency are too large to actually perform, so the ultrafinitist doesn't agree that they actually exist.</p>

<p>But, to flip things around on the ultrafinitists (to illustrate Mike's point), there's a question on mathoverflow (I think) about how if we count things twice, do we get the same answer? The question asserts that we only believe this because formal systems assume it, but I think that's backwards.</p>
<p>We use formal systems where counting is reliable because we have learned it is a reliable tool. If you counted something earlier, and you count it now and get a different number, you don't just say, "oh, well, that's how things work." Instead, you start trying to figure out why your two counts didn't match.</p>

<p>Since we ended up talking about some size issues anyways I'm curious to hear about what kind of issues you have in mind here. I've heard the same sort of thing before but my impression is that for the most part category theorists are pretty careful about size issues. But I will grant that quite a lot of this happens below the level at which we communicate so you might not see the issues addressed explicitly.</p>

<p>It's kinda orthogonal but interesting to note that in HoTT, univalent categories only form a univalent 2-category, and there is no map from there to univalent 1-categories without truncating stuff. So in a sense, when you take higher categories seriously, there may well not be a 1-category of all (small) 1-categories.</p>

<p>As long as you accept that there's a distinction between standard and nonstandard, I don't think we disagree.  (And  a nonstandard model certainly gives rise to a nonstandard notion of proof.  Nothing controversial about that.)   The hypothetical person that Mike is trying to get me to understand, who directly intuits many nonisomorphic models, does not accept this distinction.</p>

<p>The point of mentioning M's work is this: If M had released his work 2 decades after HoTT was released, we may not have had this debacle, because we may have built the tools that could have made the checking of his work a lot less laborious.

<p>Because this hypothetical person believes that PA is actually consistent.  Thinking about this makes your hypothetical person's views even less comprehensible to me; they intuit these "models of PA" but this notion relies on a notion of natural number.</p>

<p>For me, the existence of PA models that validate not-Con(PA) is just as intuitive as  the compositeness of 1147.   Each of these was easy for me to believe after I saw a proof, but the proofs were needed because I don't intuit the statements <em>directly</em>.  I find the idea that another person could intuit them directly, and therefore have no need of proof, to be far-fetched.</p>

<p>Interested to hear why you say this. <br>
ZFC people say "classes don't exist", but one can write down the syntactic category of definable classes in ZFC, and get a perfectly good infinitary pretopos, and indeed a model of Algebraic Set Theory. I would assume a similar syntactic category could exist for sets (isSet(x) is something you can say about a class x, no?), but I'm no expert. Unless working with such formal objects doesn't count as 'existence'?</p>

<p>I think the reason why many people are "at ease" with maths not being super strict about proof verification is that it is extraordinarily resilient.

"When the Germans were planning to publish Hilbert’s collected papers and to present him with a set on the occasion of one of his later birthdays, they realized that they could not publish the papers in their original versions because they were full of errors, some of them quite serious. Thereupon they hired a young unemployed mathematician, Olga Taussky-Todd, to go over Hilbert’s papers and correct all the mistakes. Olga labored for three years; it turned out that all the mistakes could be corrected without any major changes in the statement of the theorems. There was one exception: ...  At last on Hilbert's birthday a freshly printed set of Hilbert's collected papers was presented to the Geheimrat. Hilbert leafed through them carefully and did not notice anything." <a href="https://books.google.it/books?id=QV51CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=hilbert+birthday+papers+errors&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dZzU6uzKN5&amp;sig=ACfU3U1lqXkqaUzzIK1yB6yRZ7RNeEbQXg&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwitvqSpjNHoAhVow8QBHQIFAfMQ6AEwCnoECAoQLg#v=onepage&amp;q=hilbert%20birthday%20papers%20errors&amp;f=false" title="https://books.google.it/books?id=QV51CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=hilbert+birthday+papers+errors&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dZzU6uzKN5&amp;sig=ACfU3U1lqXkqaUzzIK1yB6yRZ7RNeEbQXg&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwitvqSpjNHoAhVow8QBHQIFAfMQ6AEwCnoECAoQLg#v=onepage&amp;q=hilbert%20birthday%20papers%20errors&amp;f=false">Source</a><br>
I found this remarkable. Concepts can remain right even if proofs are wrong, while the opposite (right proofs for wrong concepts) is much rarer. This is related with what someone else said above, that is, when something is not correct, if widely used it won't survive for long in maths. Indeed, it has to be noted that the majority of maths discussed in this conversation is controversial, meaning that very few mathematicians would actually  assume such results for granted in a paper right now. Contrast this with statements like P!=NP: we do not have any proof of this, nevertheless it is common to assume it to hold in many contexts, such as cryptography. People believe this holds even without proof and so they use it, without caring too much. When you think about it it's crazy, but somehow it works. So "social environment" in mathematics does not just refer to how people behave around publications and proofs. It's also very much about having a collective intuition that, albeit not often verified, and albeit not always correct, it is right 99% of the time. I think this gives people peace of mind, and I wouldn't necessarily disregard it as dangerous. It's like doing pobabilistic computation, and it has its perks.</p>

<p>Yes, I was referring to the fact that nearly everyone believes P to be not equal to NP. The only notable exception I know of is Donald Knuth, which anyway believes that "P = NP, but an algorithm to reduce a NP-complete problem to a P one is too complicated for humans to be ever able to find it", which means, in practice, that for many things he still believes you can safely rely on what P != NP implies</p>

<p>That's the reason why I part company with Fabrizio et al. on the so-called "resilience" of mathematics. "For practical purposes" is good enough for the working computer scientist, but it isn't good enough for the working mathematician.</p>
<p>The Riemann hypothesis is just as good as true for practical purposes, and many papers have been written assuming its truth, yet we'd still demand a correct proof before we'd promote it to a theorem (unlike FLT, tsk tsk <span aria-label="sweat smile" class="emoji emoji-1f605" role="img" title="sweat smile">:sweat_smile:</span> ).</p>

<p>Yes, because models are just objects in <em>another</em> mathematical theory where we're trying to mathematically model our application of theories to concrete scenarios. The point isn't that there are multiple "standard models". The point is that there are many models, and none of them deserves to be called "standard."</p>

<p>I also never suggested that a person could intuit anything without proof.  Seeing proofs is how we develop our intuition.</p>

<p>Interested to hear why you say this. <br>
ZFC people say "classes don't exist", but one can write down the syntactic category of definable classes in ZFC, and get a perfectly good infinitary pretopos, and indeed a model of Algebraic Set Theory. I would assume a similar syntactic category could exist for sets (isSet(x) is something you can say about a class x, no?), but I'm no expert. Unless working with such formal objects doesn't count as 'existence'?</p>

<p>I'm not sure it was a serious suggestion, though. More a demonstration of what considerations would be in play in a formal system for ultrafinitism. The idea that the usual notion of consistency is irrelevant is more important than the specific formal system, I think.</p>
