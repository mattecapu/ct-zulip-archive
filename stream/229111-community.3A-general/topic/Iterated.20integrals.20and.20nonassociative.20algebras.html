<p>Hi, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="303393">@Joscha Diehl</span>!  What are you doing with nonassociative algebras?  I have a fondness for those, and they're a fairly exotic topic.</p>

<p>Hi Joscha! How are iterated integrals used as "book-keeping devices" in stochastic analysis?</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span> , thanks for the interest! Currently, one object of interest to me is the half-shuffle, also known as commutative dendriform algebra, or Zinbiel algebra ('Zinbiel' b/c of Koszul duality to Leibniz algebras). You might know this product from "Eilenberg S, MacLane S. 1953 On the groups H(π, n)."</p>
<p>Denote this product by a &gt; b, then: a &gt; (b &gt;c) = (a&gt;b + b&gt;a) &gt; c. I am interested in its antisymmetrization 'area(a,b) := a&gt;b - b&gt;a' (the half-shuffle corresponds to integration of smooth functions against each other, 'area' corresponds to calculating the area between them). It is a non-associative product; apart from anti-symmetry there is no other relation with two inputs; there is no new relation with three inputs; there is exactly one new relation with four inputs, sometimes called 'tortkara', which is believed to be the only additional relation.<br>
The symmetrization of the half-shuffle, a&gt;b+b&gt;a, is the (associative and commutative !) shuffle product. Being allowed to apply the shuffle and 'area' product indiscriminately (think: binary rooted trees with 'shuffle' or 'area' decorating the inner nodes) one 'gets everything' (i.e. starting with generators of the half-shuffle algebra, which are letters of some finite alphabet, one generates the entire half-shuffle algebra).<br>
For several reasons, we are interested in reducing this to (sums of) trees, where shuffles are only allowed to appear as a subtree connected to the root. In words: "One can apply 'area' to the generators as often as one desires, and with the results, one is only allowed to shuffle (but never to take areas again)."</p>
<p>We have an indirect proof that this works, but we don't really understand 'area' well enough yet, to have a direct proof.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276424">@Rongmin Lu</span> , thanks for asking. I was a bit sloppy with language here. The book-keeping devices are the algebras. Concretely, for iterated-integrals of a stochastic process (which are important for several reasons: numerics, asymptotics, statistics, control theory, rough path analysis, ...) one usually stores them as a multiplicative character on the "shuffle Hopf algebra". The product in this Hopf algebra is the (commutative, associative) shuffle product. This is nicely compatible with taking real-valued products of real-valued iterated-integrals. The coproduct is the (noncommutative, coassociative) deconcatenation coproduct, which is nicely compatible with the concatenation (as paths) of stochastic processes.</p>

<p>I spent some time looking at Chen's iterated integrals back in my PhD days, trying to understand its use in cyclic homology. <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Zinbiel+algebra">Zinbiel algebras</a> were introduced by Loday and you should definitely check out his works.</p>

Yes, Loday indeed has some nice conceptual works on Zinbiel/dendriform algebras.</p>

<p>Sadly, no. But check out the <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=iterated+integrals">results for "iterated integrals"</a> on Google Scholar and this <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/iterated+integral">nLab page</a>.</p>
