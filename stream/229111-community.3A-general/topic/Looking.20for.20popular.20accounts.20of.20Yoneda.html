<p>Hi everyone, I'm looking for "popular science" articles (or something similar) that talk about the Yoneda embedding. I naively assumed that there would be plenty, since it is the only meaningful categorical idea that I know how to convey to people with no math background at all (and in my experience it <em>does</em> tend to sound interesting to those people).</p>
<p>However I haven't been able to find much along these lines. The only thing that comes to mind now is Eugenia Cheng's <em>The Joy of Abstraction</em>, an amazing book that I have only started reading. The first chapter seems to be very much in line with what I was looking for, but it doesn't tackle the Yoneda embedding heads-on, and of course I was looking for something shorter. I would really appreciate any help in finding this kind of resource!</p>

<p>Thanks for bringing this up! Earlier today I remembered having read this article (and finding it great), but when I went to look it up I was sort of disappointed that it was more mathematically oriented than I remembered. But now I see that I discarded it too quickly:  that passage you quoted is really good! I am writing something along the lines of what I wanted (in Spanish) and I think it might be a good idea to translate/paraphrase Tai-Danae there</p>

<p>Still, I find it surprising that there doesn't seem to be any text online aimed at e.g. Philosophy students, trying to relate the "Yoneda perspective" to ideas about things being determined by their relationships to other things, or debates about the existence of intrinsic properties, or essences. Things that people have been talking about for millennia</p>

<p>By "aimed at Philosophy students" I don't mean to say a text that engages with specifically philosophical problems, that would be too technical as well... I mean more like "here, I translate part of what makes this cool to me into a language that philosophically minded people can enjoy and find interesting" (without necessarily engaging with the problems that could arise from trying to do so rigorously)</p>

<p>When talking about the Yoneda perspective outside of mathematical contexts/to non-mathematicians, I think one important point to emphasize is that the lemma works when we can expect to know everything about the thing we are studying, when there is no “hidden information” that we might care about.</p>
<p>This is a reasonable assumption in mathematics (in fact, it’s sort of the point of mathematics IMO), but less often in the real world. For instance, you probably would say that humans could not be fully characterized by their observable properties – no matter how detailed, comprehensive, or hypothetical your collection of properties/relationships for a human is. Humans _probably_ have some hidden state that’s never going to be externally visible (or is random, etc.).</p>
<p>But this is just a small caveat, since the Yoneda perspective can be very useful when talking about observable parts of the real world and you just have to restrict your attention to that to be strictly in the spirit of the maths. (And perhaps this is just saying that isomorphism and equality of objects are different relations.) I just like to bring it up when talking about the philosophy of math.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Avoiding a debate on reductionism, I'd like to point out that the Yoneda lemma depends on the identity morphism. We're not just talking about "externally visible" states/properties: it also includes any "internal" states <em>which are included in the category</em>. The "everything" in question is "everything that has been abstracted into the categorical model", and Yoneda really does talk about that everything. The question of whether we can successfully model an informal 'everything' in a sufficiently rich categorical model is independent of the Yoneda perspective, but I suppose "be aware of which details are captured in your model/the assumptions your model depends on" is always a healthy thing to keep in mind.</p>

<p>I can't quite help with a 'pop' account, but I can point to a philosophical account. <a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/WALCHA-2">Patrick Walsh writes</a>  about the justification of path induction in homotopy type theory, in response to a <a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/LADIIH">pair</a> of <a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/LADIIH-3">papers</a> by Ladyman &amp; Presnell; Walsh ties an account of Yoneda to the view of <em>inferentialism</em>, which is roughly the view that the meaning of expressions is given by how they are used (in inferences, assertions, and so on), and draws lessons about the admissibility of "tonk"-like logical connectives.</p>

<p>Yeah, this is the better setting for what I said, sorry. If all of your properties are external (e.g. behavioral facts about particular beings in some system), implying that you don't have haecceities, then you don't have a setting to talk about internal properties of them, like identity of beings outside of their behavior. This is not surprising if you make this precise in a formal framework, but I think it's worth pointing out to non-mathematicians. Since I think if you phrase things like the Yoneda principle or identity of indiscernibles non-mathematically, the first intuition is skepticism, “why does a bunch of relationships/properties determine all you need to know about a thing?” (if your intuition for “thing” is not “mathematical object”). And then I get curious about what that says about the world mathematics versus the real world. Anyways, IANAPhilosopher.</p>

<p>I was recently reading a book "Seeing That Frees: Meditations on Emptiness and Dependent Arising" where the author Rob Burbea gives a basically identical metaphor for the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9A%C5%ABnyat%C4%81">emptiness</a> in buddhism.<br>

<p>By the way, Carlo Rovelli in his book "Helgoland" also underlined the link between his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_quantum_mechanics">relational interpretation of quantum mechanics (RQM)</a> and emptiness. I don't know if Rovelli also applies category theory in RQM? I don't recall it mentioned in the book, even though the link to Yoneda seems obvious, at least on a superficial level...</p>

<li>Louis Crane, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9504038">Clock and category: is quantum gravity algebraic?</a></li>

<p>Some principles stated in this paper:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>No observation is possible without an observer. Hence there is no Hilbert space associated with a closed universe. Any observer is part of a universe, hence occupies a 3-manifold with boundary, and makes observations on another such with a shared boundary.</li>

<li>There is no observation at a distance. Thus the Hilbert spaces in the theory reflect the interface between observer and system. This means they are associated to surfaces.</li>

They have to be appropriately <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_harmony">"harmonious"</a> with the rest of the inference rules (perhaps part of some 'interlocking adjoints' as Lawvere might put it).</p>

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="278867">@Gabriel Goren Roig</span>,</p>
<p>this is not what you asked for, but I think it's worth mentioning anyway - apologies for the shameless plug, etc, etc.</p>
<p>I spent decades wondering what made some people feel that the Yoneda Lemma and the Yoneda Embedding were "simple" in some sense. It turned out that what I was lacking was a way to draw the Lemma - and the Embedding - in a certain shape that made both the main bijections and the gory details all visible at the same time. That shape is explained in the sections 7.3, 8.4 and 8.5 of this paper,</p>

<p>I appreciate everyone's comments on the topic!</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="278070">@Evan Washington</span> Thanks for the reference! The relationship with inferentialism seems pretty interesting. There is a straightforward analogy between saying "An object is determined by the arrows into/out of it" versus "The meaning of  logical connectives is given by its introduction/elimination rules" which I hadn't thought about at all.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276057">@Verity Scheel</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277473">@Morgan Rogers (he/him)</span>  I agree with Morgan in that if you think of categories as models of a certain kind, then the Yoneda perspective is saying that in this kind of models, all properties captured by the models are relational... So I don't think you need to expect to know everything about the thing you are studying. It's just a model, and when working whithin the model, you assume (tacitly) that it's true and it captures everything.</p>
<p>Actually, the fact that you can make mathematical models in which all properties are relational (as witnessed by category theory) can be thought of as evidence for the applicability of these purely relational models. Perhaps it inspires us to think relationally about more things, expecting properties to become relational once we find the right theoretical framework ("the right ambient category") for them. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276057">@Verity Scheel</span> you say that the initial intuition for many people about this this sort of relationalism is skepticism. Well, I'm thinking of the Yoneda perspective as a way of challenging that intuition, perhaps not the best one in itself when taken separately, but one that adds to many other ways of motivating or advocating for relational ontology</p>

<p>A philosophical counterpart of this observation is that the principle of "identity of indiscernibles" becomes trivially true when the properties to which you can apply indiscernibility include haecceities (the property of being equal to X).</p>

<p>Great!  </p>
<p>By the way, I think it would be hard, but interesting, to try to define what you mean by "mathematical models in which all properties are relational" to the level of precision where I could take two models (I think mathematicians call them "theories") and <em>prove</em> that all properties are relational in one, but not in another.</p>

<p>If I had to do this, I would try by saying that "all properties are relational" in a theory iff there's a certain large amount of <em>symmetry</em> in the theory.</p>

<p>Physicists have been thinking about relationalism and symmetry at least since Galileo and Leibniz.  In 1876 Maxwell wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our whole progress up to this point may be described as a gradual development of the doctrine of relativity of all physical phenomena.   Position we must evidently acknowledge to be relative, for we cannot describe the position of a body in any terms which do not express relation… There are no landmarks in space; one portion of space is exactly like every other portion, so that we cannot tell where we are. We are, as it were, on an unruffled sea, without stars, compass, sounding, wind or tide, and we cannot tell in which direction we are going. We have no log which we can case out to take a dead reckoning by; we may compute our rate of motion with respect to the neighboring bodies, but we do not know how these bodies may be moving in space.</p>

<p>And the connection between symmetry and the Yoneda embedding theorem is very interesting.  For example, this theorem has as a special case <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley%27s_theorem">Cayley's theorem</a>, which could be called the fundamental theorem of group theory.   (It says every group can be seen as a subgroup of the group of permutations of some set.)</p>

<p>The main reason I mention it is that I've seen confusion caused by people having this as a slogan - "Yoneda embedding for a group is Cayley's Theorem".  For instance, thinking that it involves a functor from <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>G</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">G</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">G</span></span></span></span> to sets rather than to <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>G</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">G</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">G</span></span></span></span>-sets.</p>
<p>Also, the Yoneda embedding result is even cooler than Cayley's Theorem: the only permutations of a group that commute with the right action are those coming from left multiplication by a group element!</p>

<p>I certainly agree that the common statement of Cayley's Theorem as "every group is isomorphic to a subgroup of some permutation group" is pathetically weak, practically just like patting someone on the back and reassuring them that somewhere out there that permutation group exists - what good is that?</p>

<p>Slander!   :-)  I didn't say that Cayley's Theorem is pathetically weak.  </p>
<p>Anyway, I thought that the good in Cayley's Theorem was along the following lines.  People studied symmetries of things and studied groups of such symmetries.  Then someone axiomatized what a 'group' is without any reference to symmetry, then Cayley's Theorem says, yes we haven't done anything stupid and added anything weird in our axiomatization, we are still essentially looking at groups of symmetries.</p>

<p>But that's sort of a "pat on the back" result, something that makes you feel good.   I guess sometime I should look around and study more carefully how people actually use Cayley's Theorem to prove other results... not just sleep better at night.</p>

<p>And that leads me back to the main topic of this thread.   There's the "feel-good" aspect of the Yoneda embedding theorem: "it's really cool, dude - everything is relational!   <span aria-label="star struck" class="emoji emoji-1f929" role="img" title="star struck">:star_struck:</span> "   And then there's the various ways people actually use the Yoneda embedding theorem to prove stuff.  And there seems to be a gap between these two.   It would be good to study that gap, and maybe bridge it.</p>

<p>And my point was that "The Yoneda embedding for a group is <em>just</em> Cayley's Theorem" is not a good slogan.  (I've added a word there.)

<p>Hi everyone, I'm looking for "popular science" articles (or something similar) that talk about the Yoneda embedding. I naively assumed that there would be plenty, since it is the only meaningful categorical idea that I know how to convey to people with no math background at all (and in my experience it <em>does</em> tend to sound interesting to those people).</p>
<p>However I haven't been able to find much along these lines. The only thing that comes to mind now is Eugenia Cheng's <em>The Joy of Abstraction</em>, an amazing book that I have only started reading. The first chapter seems to be very much in line with what I was looking for, but it doesn't tackle the Yoneda embedding heads-on, and of course I was looking for something shorter. I would really appreciate any help in finding this kind of resource!</p>

<p>I think that you are thinking of propositions, whereas W. more likely refers to (atomic) facts, which play the role of axioms in his system. So this proposition just says that axioms are independent of one another.</p>

<p>Notice the formulation of the first proposition, to which this one is related: "The world is all that is <em>the case</em>" He doesn't say "everything that is <em>true</em>", I think that it is because  we can derive infinitely many true propositions from a given set of facts, but those are just our invention, not part of "the world".</p>

<p>Re Wittgenstein:  I've been much more a scholar of his later work but then LW always point back to his Tractatus as somewhat complementary. Invoking his "meaning from usage" (but also "aspect shifts" i.e. gestalts) seems consistent with the doctrine of "emptiness" in Zen etc. i.e. meaning is not from "pointing" to some essentially private self object and that goes for the word "I" too.</p>

<p>Here is a presentation on a neuroscience topic by Dr. Alexander Maier which discusses the Yoneda lemma. It is an informal account.<br>
I know almost nothing about neuroscience, but the claim is that enriched categories and the Yoneda lemma are applied to help with a paradox in color perception known as the inverted spectrum hypothesis. If the claim is true, that certainly is interesting. </p>

<p>Yes, I saw this too. I've also noticed there is someone who repeatedly posts about oddball "hyperduality" ideas under most category theory videos.</p>

<p>I think the Yoneda lemma has potential to become a second Gödel’s second incompleteness theorem (pun intended haha) in the list of results that are abused for all kinds of purposes by people who are vaguely familiar with them.</p>

<p>This paragraph!!!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] they start by assuming a specific category of ‘qualia’, or other things, and then they claim to be able to uniquely pin down the objects therein using isomorphism classes of representable presheaves over it. But this is circular: everything is determined by the choice of morphisms they make when defining the category at the start, so they can distinguish objects only insofar as they already assumed they could do so. </p>

If you take the category of modules, you'll get the "cyclic powers" of your modules, either the space of vectors invariant by cyclic permutation with the equalizer or the space of cyclic tensors with the coequalizer.  And if you take the category of sets, you'll get either the list invariant by cyclic permutations or the cyclic lists. If your symmetric monoidal category is enriched over the category of abelian groups, then if you replace <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>c</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>g</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">c(g)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">c</span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">g</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span> by something like <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn><msup><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mi>n</mi></msup><mi>c</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>g</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">(-1)^{n}c(g)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord">−</span><span class="mord">1</span><span class="mclose"><span class="mclose">)</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.6644em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mathnormal mtight">n</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mord mathnormal">c</span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">g</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span>, you get the modules involved in cyclic (co)homology which are kind of anticommutative cyclic power. </p>
<p>Well, that's a bit far fetched, but that's what evokes me the Cayley theorem: the idea of letting a group act on the tensor powers of an object in a symmetric monoidal category by reminding that groups are just an abstract way to encode permutations and that symmetric monoidal categories know about these latters.</p>
