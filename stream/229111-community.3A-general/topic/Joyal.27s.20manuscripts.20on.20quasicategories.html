<p>What is the present state of Joyal's manuscripts on quasicategories?</p>
<p>Some context: Until recently I thought two of these were online:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notes on quasi-categories, available on May's homepage, and</li>
<li>
<p>The theory of quasi-categories and its applications, available on Kock's webpage,<br>
and one unpublished book draft:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The theory of quasi-categories, unavailable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I read the following on Riehl–Verity's book:<br>
"Joyal first undertook the task of extending 1-category theory to quasi-categories in [50] and [51] and in several unpublished draft book manuscripts". Here [50] is a published paper and [51] is the book draft on Kock's homepage.</p>
<p>Are there other "secret"/publically unavailable book drafts besides the one mentioned above?</p>

<p>Has Joyal's book with Tierney on simplicial sets come out yet?</p>

<p>I don't think there are other manuscripts available. A bigger treatise was planned, but it did not fully come into existence. The last draft I saw was in 2005. It is my impression that the parts that were in shape at that time found their way into either the IMA or the CRM lecture notes, and that many of the parts that were not fully developed turned into the outlook sections featured in the IMA and CRM notes.</p>

<p>They were published in the Quaderns lecture note series of the CRM (Barcelona, 2008). Unfortunately the CRM no longer keeps the old volumes online. (Instead it can be found here:  <a href="http://www.mat.uab.cat/~kock/crm/hocat/advanced-course/Quadern47.pdf">http://www.mat.uab.cat/~kock/crm/hocat/advanced-course/Quadern47.pdf</a>)</p>

<p>Thanks!  It's ridiculous that CRM doesn't keep its lecture notes online.  Can't they afford to have a webpage?</p>
