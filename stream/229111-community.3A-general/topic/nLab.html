<p>I guess everyone here is at least aware that nLab has been having technical difficulties in the last months. But I only just saw these words written by Urs: (<a href="http://128.2.67.219/schreiber/show/What+is...+the+nLab#fn:1">http://128.2.67.219/schreiber/show/What+is...+the+nLab#fn:1</a>)</p>
<p>"The operation of the main web of the nnLab had been abruptly suspended on 29 Dec. 2021 by its single volunteer installation administrator at that time, without notice or discussion. (The forum page with the shutdown announcement is now down, too.) Authors have been locked out of all their pages since (in particular I continue being locked out of my home page, please check by email whether information given there is still accurate, in case it matters).<br>
The currently remaining rudimentary page display is hence outdated, besides having been partially broken in the shutdown process; and readers should please beware that the nnLab pages they currently get to see have not been, are not being and cannot be maintained until further notice. (Some pages are not even displaying their latest content as of the shutdown moment anymore.)<br>
Requests to at least post an alert to this effect on displayed pages have been turned down without reason; and a succession of announcements of system recovery have all passed without effect, instead further functionality has been switched off since. In short, the nnLab installation has de facto died on 29 Dec. 2021, and it is unclear if or when it will be revived in the future, and in which state of coherence or trustworthiness. Myself, I have unfortunately no control or command over the installation, having trusted in volunteer help on this crucial point.<br>
A hard restart of the entire nnLab project seems to be necessary, and maybe there is some value to this, dire as it feels at this point. If anyone reading this sees themselves willing and capable to set up, host and administrate a research wiki vaguely like the nnLab was, possibly better, then please contact me."</p>

<p>The important thing isn't not to rely on volunteers, but insofar as possible not to rely.  The main thing is to have a process by which the service can be set up again without help from whoever is currently running it, like always having up-to-date backups in the hands of the wiki administrators (and if possible, slightly-less-up-to-date backups available to the general public).</p>

<p>(Also, the domain should be held by an organization composed of the wiki administrators, rather than by any unrelated org 'on their behalf'.  This is secondary though--links being broken is bad, but not nearly as bad as links being broken <em>unsystematically</em>.)</p>

<p>Putting someone to work on this means paying someone part-time to do it. At least for a startup-like reality, this is just not possible. Also I wouldn't be too happy knowing that ncatlab is privately managed.</p>

<p>The best strategy imho would be to request some sort of grant for this task, and use that money to pay some freelance professional to take care of it. Also, I'd request monthly or at least quarterly backups so that if something like this happens again in the future the project can be restarted easily. I really hope Urs has some backups of the ncatlab.</p>

<p>29 Dec 2021 is a long time ago, and the nLab has been "running" much more recently than that.  I suggest asking Urs whether that quoted text is just an out-of-date leftover.</p>

<p>Ah, reading more closely I see that Urs is referring to the shutdown of <em>editing</em>, which has indeed been going on that long.  I wish I were able to help with solving the problem myself, but I have too much on my plate at the moment already.</p>
<p>I do think that there are backups of the page source, in at least some form.  My personal workstation has been running daily backups for a while, and I think Urs and possibly one or two others also have.  It looks like they stopped working this March, but I still have backups from December, January, and February -- I haven't looked at them, but the gzipped files are 1.2G, so they have <em>something</em> in them.</p>

<p>Industry usually gives money to develop things. You finance an institute or a startup to get a slice of the possible earnings. From this point of view financing the nlab is a bit of a dead end: It is not intrinsically novel per sé, it's just a repository. Industry investors have little incentives to invest in something like this instead of moving their money towards something that deliver novel, exploitable research. The only incentive I can think of is philanthropy, which is a very rare thing to find lol</p>

<p>Clearly if something like the Topos Institute acquires a staggering valuation, then they could use part of the money to maintain the nlab. The problem is getting to that valuation. Almost all startups in this space are pretty early on, in a stage where every penny counts <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span></p>

<p>Richard estimates that costs will be &lt; $6 a month (<a href="https://nforum.ncatlab.org/discussion/13776/nlab-migration-to-the-cloud/?Focus=97893#Comment_97893">https://nforum.ncatlab.org/discussion/13776/nlab-migration-to-the-cloud/?Focus=97893#Comment_97893</a>). So securing funding is not a top priority.</p>
<p>Urs seems to be being overly dramatic about the whole thing. This migration was necessary to create the kind of robust technology for the nLab that we all want. It's now running on AWS; whereas before it was running on a single box in someone's office. The plan is also to open-source all the code.</p>
<p>Also, the search is now infinitely faster than it was before, which anyone who experienced the old search will know is an absolute blessing.</p>

<p>I'd guess the nForum is probably down for an unrelated reason; I just checked that the nCafe has no post about the nLab's technical problems, so probably this very thread is 3rd in line to the throne of places that anyone can even talk about this.

<p>Sure. And Urs' post made some sense when he originally made it. I just don't understand why he's sounding the alarm again by retweeting it now that most of the trouble is over. It's lead to a post on reddit declaring 'Apparently nLab is dead' at the top of r/math with 105 votes. This is frustrating because it will discourage people from interacting with the nLab at exactly the moment when editing is being reopened.</p>

For example, <a href="https://www.lmfdb.org/acknowledgment">LMFDB</a> seems to be of a similar age to the nlab, and seems to have a more formal sense of organization. (And they seem to do it basically with academic rather than industrial funding sources.) Am I looking at the wrong webpage about nlab organization?</p>

<p>Well, it's a testament to Urs et al's work that the nlab plays an outsize role in my professional life, anyway.

<p>it would be bad, and ominous, if nlab is lost. not just for the people who invested work into it but also for the web itself --- which evolved from a place to exchange CERN preprints and post CT blogs to a place where people are tracked, profiled, sold, and steered. the reason why we are offered this zulip service, tweets and so on is in exchange for carrying with us the cookies which these providers kindly leave in the browsers that they kindly provide, unless you use the onion...</p>
<p>so maybe this is a good moment to rethink the whole thing: what is the place of science in all that? suppose the nLab resurrects tomorrow. who will run it 30 years from now? if the nLab content is offered to elsevier or one of the angel or venture investors into science, they will happily throw money at it. alternatives? </p>
<p>the problem is not the operating costs but the incentive for persistence: some sort of entity that does not suffer from human shortcomings such as limited attention span or even limited life span.</p>
<p>the certificate thing (and the web browsers that protect you from the grave dangers of expired certificates) says that any web site that is not helping trackers track people nowadays needs a survival strategy, which may or may not be a business model.</p>

<p>Projects seem to reach a point in their lifetime when they need some kind of "administrator/organizer" whose job is to take care of the boring, non-technical bits of having a project "exist".  Clearly LMFDB has that, but the nLab does not. The importance of that task is typically extremely under-valued, especially by technical people (in fact, the deeper the technical expertise, the more I see a lack of understanding of the importance of those managements tasks).</p>

<p>Broadly generalizing, nobody really _likes_ working on the infrastructure of hosting a wiki and updating the software and ensuring backups happen, etc. They do it because they feel it is important. If possible, it is much better to pay people to work on such things, rather than relying on volunteers, and additionally, this ensures that what people other than the volunteers value is what gets prioritized (because the volunteers, by virtue of being the ones donating all the work, otherwise really get to set agendas however they see fit, and work on things only when they have time and energy, and also may be called away at any point due to paid job demands or family or a thousand other things). So I am less concerned about funding for hosting, and more about the larger funding required to get stable development and administration of the system itself. (I say this as someone who has been involved in infrastructure work as a volunteer for many years, and who is working with the HF on professionalizing chunks of such work into the hands of paid staff)</p>

<p>Since I read the nForum I was aware of this stuff all the time.    Anyone who contributes to the nLab instead of just passively using it is urged to note changes on the nForum, and then you see what's going on.  It's just like Wikipedia: you don't notice the details of how it works until you start trying to contribute.</p>

<p>I don't want to derail the conversation but I find it a bit confusing that whenever there is a problem with the community the new silver bullet is to say "Topos will fix it." But I can't bare but think _why_ is it Topos that should fix it, a large number of us are in huge established institutions, I vouch to claim that a large number of us are using the nlab. _We_ should solve the problem with some guidance from established people in this domain (such as John and Jacques). I am also concerned generally about this reliance (at least intellectually in our minds) on Topos, as John said it's a new institution, it needs time money and people to grow and establish itself. These problems we discuss here really don't feel suited or perhaps a good use of _their_ time (if imposed implicitly or explicitly by the community). I'd rather they make category theory more useful and applicable and establish it as a reasonable applied field.</p>

<p>My impression of the whole ordeal is not that there were not people willing to volunteer for maintenance (there's at least two, and on the migration thread on the nForum I've seen a bunch more offering their services), but that migration wasn't well-planned nor communicated with the community. That, plus a lack of redundancy (Richard was alone in doing this when he started), was recipe for a disaster (that didn't happen at the scale it could have). It doesn't seem the case that paying Richard would have sped up things considerably, not that we <em>needed</em> a paid figure at all.<br>
Of course having a paid professional would help tremendously, but I don't see the case (yet).</p>

<p>Yes, I think self-reliance is a good direction --- and also considering ways to have tools that don't actually need regular volunteer maintenance beyond someone dropping in to kick the tires every couple years.

<p>The thing that those of us with technical/computer abilities need to think about when we offer our volunteer work to help the mathematical community is: we should not go in directions that ensure _dependence_ on us, because we may have personal emergencies or just get tired of working on it. When we offer our services, we should be doing so with the aim of making mathematicians relatively independent. One consequence of that is, we probably should not be developing and planning amazing cloud services or things that are harder to deploy than "one click".</p>

<p>It may seem like you are doing mathematicians a huge favor by putting in all this work, but the reality is more like "If I have a personal emergency, Urs Schreiber's research notebook gets held hostage for months". It is a very negative result of a very positive impulse to be of service, and part of our responsibility as engineers is to take that into account.  Do no harm.</p>

<p>Right...... I can't speak for the financial situation of Topos, but looking in from the outside I believe that they're partly existing grant-to-grant, they have some "regular" funding but not enough to guarantee to sustain them at the size they've already grown to, and definitely not enough to throw resources around. Compare the arXiv, which brings in lots of funding but is in the end maintained by people at Cornell</p>

<p>Possibly I <em>was</em> looking at the wrong page for information about the organization of the nlab. The <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Organization%20of%20the%20nLab">page</a> I linked to, as well as <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlabmeta/show/Organization+of+the+nLab">this variant</a> don't mention the "steering committee" named at <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlabmeta/show/steering+committee">this page</a> and linked from <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/steering+committee">this variant</a>. Interestingly, although the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlabmeta/show/Organization+of+the+nLab">Organization of the nLab</a> page I linked does not refer to the steering committee, it kind of appears that the "steering committee" idea has at least been discussed years ago on the <a href="https://nforum.ncatlab.org/discussion/36/organization-of-the-nlab/">associated nforum discussion</a>.</p>

<p>Yes, but it's still extra work compared to having the nLab people take care of themselves.</p>

<p>The whole point is that the nLab people were <strong>not</strong> taking care of it. The cool parts (i.e. the contents, which is why it became so popular), sure. But the hidden, boring things? Clearly not, since this crisis would not have existed otherwise.  This week is the first time I've heard the name "Richard Williamson" and "Adeel Kahn", even though I've been using the nLab for years. This shows you how hidden their work was, until it stopped being done.</p>

<p>As John was suggesting, it's clear from this that you weren't tuned into the nForum much, where the names of Adeel and Richard were very well known. (For instance, neither of them is named in any of the organizational nlab pages I linked above.)</p>
<p>One thing the nLab folks were not good at is soliciting funding, whether institutionally or through private donations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do think it would be nice if people like Richard and Adeel's contributions could somehow be more visible to the average nlab user, who probably never visits the nforum at all. (For instance, neither of them seems to be named in any of the organizational pages I linked above.)</p>

<p>The nLab "steering committee" doesn't do very much; mainly we deal with the occasional hard-to-discourage crackpot.  It's not really a directorial or technical body.  As it happens, we are discussing right now the possibility of constituting a more technical directive committee.</p>

<p>I'd something similar in previous comments.   Later I deleted those comments because they weren't quite phrased right: I'd forgotten that the Topos Institute <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/funding+of+the+nLab">already is</a> helping raise money for the nLab.   But only in a minimal way, I believe.  Namely, they have a webpage where you can make a donation.   That probably took just a couple person-hours of work to set up.  </p>
<p>So I still agree it's not good not to think of the Topos Institute as a big powerful thing that can solve all our problems!  Think of it as a small chick that may someday grow into a majestic eagle - but only if we help it.</p>
<p>I'm trying to help them develop a 'killer app' that they can wave around to show people that applied category theory is really useful.  Right now this 'killer app' is software for public health modeling.   (Yes, the quoted term is ironic.)</p>

<p>I'm not aware of any faucet that continuously pours or even drips money into the Topos Institute bank account.   As far as I know, they get their money from donations from a few Silicon Valley bigshots together with grants that various people have been able to get, e.g. David Spivak and Evan Patterson / James Fairbanks.</p>

<p>Let me try to explain why I suggested Topos play a role, and also why I do not advocate that Topos per se play a role given the useful comments here. The Haskell Foundation and the Topos institute were launched at relatively similar times. Of course the two communities are very different, but within that setting they seemed to share some similar goals. In particular, at least initially, my understanding was that Topos could act as a centralizing body for "general community infrastructure" much as the HF aims to do, and has a similar goal of stabilizing core resources for a broader group. Now, it may be that's not the direction Topos is going in -- fine! But, the concern is again that there comes a certain point in which relying on individual volunteer work reaches its limits, and the stopgap solution is to scale up a bit the existing thing, but the real solution is necessarily going to involve some more regular funding that can pay not just for hardware costs (relatively cheap!) but for individuals to have the time to responsibly and consistently put in effort, and further, to establish some publicly known chain of ownership and responsibility, which involves an institution with some legal standing, and ideally with a 501(c) so it can handle nonprofit status for donations, and also have enough infrastructure to organize paying people. Ideally, you save some work by not having too many institutions which have to replicate that structure. But again, maybe Topos is not going to be that. My opinion is simply that, at a certain point, which is perhaps near, perhaps not, _something_ should be that, or, through no fault of any hardworking individual involved, there will be sporadic frustrating messes for want of such a thing.</p>
<p>(and the point is not certainly that "topos should pay" but rather whatever centralizing institution is established can be a centralized conduit for funds and effort, in terms both of responsibility and synchronization, so that organizations can pay and know their funds are using in a fashion their administrators are comfortable is well accounted for)</p>

<p>2 full time salaried employees and a fair number of other people doing unpaid volunteer work in various ways including a 13 member board,  and also various committees and working groups. (which sometimes are semi-formalizing things that would have existed anyway, but now have a more cohered structure -- and also independent projects have now loosely affiliated, which again is just a modest formalization of a relationship that offers sort of the promise of coordination and help in directing resources but without much official Teeth).</p>
<p>HF looks as though it expends relatively fewer resources -- fewer employees, no physical office, and no funding of research work. It seems the visions ended up being quite different, with Topos worrying about actually centralizing and driving research, while HF is focused on "filling in gaps" and coordinating administration and infrastructure -- but you would be much better able to explain the Topos side of things than whatever my inferences are!</p>

<p>Topos is a research institute and there seems to be a misunderstand. That while Topos might be part of the community, we are not part of Topos. As any other institute it has goals of its own and researchers of its own, that draft a particular trajectory within ACT. It is not _for_ the ACT community, even if it does things to benefit us. It might be better to compare Topos to a research lab rather than HF.</p>

<p>A long time ago on the Cafe, a post (I think one of John's) started off with a link to a YouTube video, no longer available AFAIK, where the narrator complains "The monads make my head hurt!" There seems to be a kind of myth, maybe especially prominent among students of Haskell, that monads are some sort of hurdle or rite of passage that everyone has to get through, typically after a struggle. [Actually, I think maybe they mean a strong monad on a cartesian closed category, but never mind that.] </p>
<p>I would like to think of the deployment of "just" not as a sign of arrogance and therefore a negative attitude, but more a positive attitude of trying to be helpful: "look here, it's not so bad, if you remember it like this". I think I can honestly say that I never had a problem with monads, having learnt about them from Mac Lane.</p>

<p>Many years ago I recall a conversation about "category theory purity tests", that involved coming up with short statements like this that would only make sense to someone who was "sufficiently categorically impure".  I think the best one we came up with was "the center of a set is 'true'".</p>

<p>Well, the Haskellers do care about the laws --- though without either an established equational theory for the Haskell language nor an actual semantic model (e.g. some proper domain theory), it is a bit unclear what exactly is meant by these laws in the context of Haskell.</p>

<p>All: I'd rather not perpetuate memes that only serve to cement the perceived elitism of category theory and/or the nLab. I'm making nLab merch, some of which will be humorous self-deprecation, but obviously so ("A <em>moduli stack of elliptic cuvres</em> is a <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/moduli%20stack">moduli stack</a> of <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/elliptic+curve">elliptic curves</a>" is too good to pass up as a mug quote...), not generic CT meme material. Anyone who wants to sell that can do so! I'm operating my own product account, and donating the money, so I'm aware of what sort of messages I might be choosing to send.</p>

<p>Notes to self:</p>
<ol>
<li>At some point between 2015 and 2022, the nlab must have changed the default way that theorem-numbering is done, because the theorem numbers referenced on the nforum do not match up with the theorem numbers in the revision history.</li>

<p>just to throw my 2 cents on this, just one person's preference: I wear graphic tees pretty exclusively, and I don't like ones with words beyond the name of a band or similar. So I'd buy one with "nLab" but not "a monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors".</p>

<p>The permanent move to the new nLab server is happening at <time datetime="2022-10-07T13:00:00Z">2022-10-07T06:00:00-07:00</time> (UTC 13:00).  At that time the nLab and nForum will temporarily be switched to read-only.  During the move, which is projected to last "between 10 minutes and 6 hours", you will get an error message if you try to edit the nLab or post in the nForum.  At the end of the migration, the nLab and nForum will be switched to the new server and editing/posting will work again.  It may be that some things are broken afterwards; if you notice any, please report them on the <a href="https://nforum.ncatlab.org/discussion/15224/server-migration-friday-7-oct-2022/">nForum</a>.</p>
