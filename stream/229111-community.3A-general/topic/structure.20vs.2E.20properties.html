<p>I don't know a reference, but the general idea behind this distinction is that a property of a mathematical object is something that exists uniquely, when it does exist, and a structure is something extra added to the object, not generally unique. So a monoidal product is an extra structure on a category, because a category can generally have many different monoidal products, whereas the categorical product is a property, because they are unique up to isomorphism whenever they exist.</p>

<p>People in the know use "stuff" as appropriate: for example a graph of the sort category theorists like (a quiver) is a set equipped with extra stuff, while a graph of the sort graph theorists like (a simple graph) is a set equipped with extra structure.</p>

<p>I find this discussion in terms of forgetful functors difficult to get a grip on, but I think there is another viewpoint using the left adjoint functor, the one that freely constructs a new category that has the specified stuff/structure/properties. In this case, stuff corresponds to freely adjoining objects, structure freely adjoins morphisms, and properties corresponds to adjoining equations for these morphisms. Ie. stuff is 0-cells, structure is 1-cells, properties are 2-cells. This seems much more intuitive to me than using forgetful functors, because that already assumes you know what it is that you are about to forget. Also, it makes clear how this should generalize to higher dimensions. (i hope i am not too confused here...)</p>

<p>Anyone knows where the distinction "Structure vs. Properties" appears, and is explained, in print? I read something about it ages ago in some text from which I didn't understand much - I don't remember where it was, sorry - and I invented my own meaning for it... in my meaning when we express a functor F in Type Theory it becomes (F_0, F_1, respid, respcomp), where F_0 and F_1 - its actions on objects and morphisms - are "structure", and respid and respcomp, that assure that F respects identities and compositions, are "properties". Roughly, the last two components are "properties" because they mention equalities of morphisms, and the first two components are "structure" because they don't...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we had a paprer written a few years ago where we asked ourselves if compact closure is a structure or a property. The difference for us was that a structure is something that you can impose (e.g. <strong>Set</strong> can have different monoidal structures on itself) while a property is somewhat canonical. I don't know if this is the distinction you want. In any case, the paper is this one: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00708" title="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00708">https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00708</a></p>

<p>The way I think of it is that properties are unique structures.</p>

<p>Does that mean that this notion is different from the 'stuff, structure, properties' classification, because the latter has "property-like structure"?</p>

<p>Yes, so "property" here really means that it follows canonically. For instance, the cartesian product is a property of the category of sets and functions, but a monoidal structure on sets and functions is a structure because it's not unique</p>

<p>This "conflict" - being essentially injective, but not being full, probably accounts for a lot of everyone's queasiness about whether "having finite products" is a structure or a property of categories.   It's a combination that doesn't show up often in <em>set-based</em> algebraic gadgets like groups or rings.</p>

<p>Anyone knows where the distinction "Structure vs. Properties" appears, and is explained, in print? I read something about it ages ago in some text from which I didn't understand much - I don't remember where it was, sorry - and I invented my own meaning for it... in my meaning when we express a functor F in Type Theory it becomes (F_0, F_1, respid, respcomp), where F_0 and F_1 - its actions on objects and morphisms - are "structure", and respid and respcomp, that assure that F respects identities and compositions, are "properties". Roughly, the last two components are "properties" because they mention equalities of morphisms, and the first two components are "structure" because they don't...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we had a paprer written a few years ago where we asked ourselves if compact closure is a structure or a property. The difference for us was that a structure is something that you can impose (e.g. <strong>Set</strong> can have different monoidal structures on itself) while a property is somewhat canonical. I don't know if this is the distinction you want. In any case, the paper is this one: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00708" title="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00708">https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00708</a></p>

<p>There are scenarios where I think the functor formulation of stuff structure property maybe doesn't apply (yet?). For instance fractals. I think most people who work on fractals agree there's clearly no definition that captures everything we think of as fractals, and excludes things we aren't fractals. So being a fractal appears to definitely be a property, and probably a mathematical one, but we can't say that with a functor.</p>

<p>We need vague words in math because you can't be precise <em>all</em> the time, like when you're starting to come up with new ideas.  So it's good that "fractal" is vague.  There are lots of precise concepts like "metric space with nonintegral Hausdorff dimension", which capture some aspects of fractality, but  hovering over all of them is the vague concept of "fractal".</p>

<p>I'm vaguely uncomfortable about "forgetting stuff". In my little plan to organize types by canonical embedding, then, for example, Integer is canonically embedded in Rational. I make the rule that lower types inherit all structure and properties from above, so that Integer acquires the denominator structure in the obvious way. Going up seems like a sort of forgetting: the integer forgets that it had denominator 1. And as you go up, forgetting more and more properties and structure, you need more and more data. So, in my brain, forgetting is associated with having more "stuff", I guess that means I'm in the wrong section, but it seems very close.</p>

<p>That's very nice; I'd forgotten or never known they said that.  But that's just what we were stumbling intohere  in the case of the forgetful functor from the category of monoids to the category of semigroups: a faithful functor that's full on isomorphisms... but not full.   If it were faithful and full we'd say it "forgets at most properties".    If it were merely faithful we'd say it "forgets at most structure".  But this is perched halfway between.</p>

<p>The map from Integer to Rational is not a functor between categories (as far as I can tell), so the current discussion of forgetful functors and whether they forget "properties, structure or stuff" is not directly relevant.   </p>
<p>Here's a functor that "forgets stuff".  There's a category Graph where objects are graphs - a graph being a set of vertices, a set of edges and two maps assigning to each edge its "source" and "target" vertex  There's a category Set where the objects are sets.  There's a forgetful functor U: Graph <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>→</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\rightarrow</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.36687em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mrel">→</span></span></span></span> Set that sends each graph to its set of vertices.  This "forgets stuff" in the technical sense: it's not faithful.  And it "forgets stuff" in the intuitive sense: it forgets the set of edges of a graph.</p>

I think we can understand the map from integers to rationals (viewed as posets) as a functor E.  It happens to have both a left adjoint F (floor) and a right adjoint C (ceil).  It seems to me that F and C, being faithful and surjective-on-objects, forget purely structure, and that E, being full, faithful, but not surjective on objects, forgets only properties (like the property of being integral).  </p>
<p>Does this seem right?  Unlike typical "forgetful" functors, not all of these are right adjoints and not all of these are injective on objects.  So maybe the analogy isn't useful.</p>
<p>Also, the functors are not monoidal (wrt addition), so that's another flaw.</p>

<p>Thanks folks. I'm less confused. One thing I looked at when trying to understand all this was Toby Bartels polynomials.pdf. For some reason chrome's pdf reader can't handle it and the characters and spacing are slightly off. If you read it in Adobe Reader it's fine. In case anyone else has this problem.</p>

<p>I'm kind of curious what a nice HoTT characterization of this would be, if there is one. I looked more at essential k-surjectivity and came to the conclusion that it's not the same as (k-2)-connectedness. It seems more like -1-connectedness (surjectivity) of the k-th path level. But I'm not sure if focusing on the surjectivity version is ideal in that setting.</p>
<p>I guess maybe the core there is that the fibers of the map have all the information you want to know about what was thrown away, and all the characterizations are just different ways of probing pieces to talk about. So just knowing the (smallest) h-level of the fibers tells you the 'most' forgotten. And that might also give you a way of talking in terms of equipping instead of forgetting.</p>

<p>It still seems to me that it makes some sense to apply SSP to unique things. For example the natural numbers: <br>
We have some stuff (words of booleans are popular).<br>
We have some structure: Zero picks out one entity in our stuff; Every entity has a single Succ "morphism" going to another element, and each of these has a Pred morphism that is an inverse.<br>
We have some properties: (NoLoop) Zero is not the target of any Succ; (Induction) for any dependent predicate P(n), P(Zero) and forall(n)(P(n) implies P(Succ(n)) implies forall(n)(P(n)).<br>
I guess it makes a boring category since it only has one entry up to isomorphism. Still one could think about forgetting properties. If you forget NoLoop then finite loops also come in. If you forget Induction then you can have extra loops on the side of the main chain of numbers.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277270">@Dan Doel</span> Right: plain HoTT is about higher groupoids, so it doesn't see anything that distingushes between invertible and noninvertible morphisms.  But in that context, a map that forgets only $n$-stuff is equivalently an $n$-truncated map, i.e. one whose fibers are $n$-types.</p>

<p>Or, had some other uniform structure on types than paths. I was thinking, based on the recent paper on parametricity/logical relations in wider mathematics, perhaps you could characterize property/structure/stuff appropriately with that, and then perhaps one of the theories with both paths and relations could talk about it.</p>

<p>I guess the problem with the Cavallo-Harper cubical parametricity, for a mathematician, is that it refutes excluded middle. So there'd need to be some mechanism in the theory for not everything to be parametric, like multiple modes, or the cohesive inspired stuff from Nuyts-Vezzose-Devriese.</p>

<p>Well actually, I kind of wonder if it's related to the new paper you worked on. :) The paper I just linked suggests that the intuitive descriptions initially given for naturality and parametricity were the same. Naturality developed using (directed) homomorphisms, and parametricity using something more like structure-respecting relations.</p>
<p>So maybe an appropriate signature in a theory with parametricity automatically gains (something much closer to) an appropriate notion of 'indiscernibility'? Because the parts of the signature are specified in such a way that they <em>must</em> be natural, and there is no need to write all the conditions that specify what naturality means. I don't know.</p>

<p>Hmm, rereading the parametricity paper, I guess one of its arguments is that logical relations would actually not always agree with homomorphisms on properties vs. structure (I think). For instance, being a group is a property of a monoid, because every monoid homomorphism must preserve inverses if they exist, right? But logical relations between monoids needn't relate inverses (says the paper), so the inverse would appear as property-like structure.</p>
