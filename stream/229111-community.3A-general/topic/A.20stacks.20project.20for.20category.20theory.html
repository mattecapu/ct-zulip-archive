<p>Today I'm releasing the Clowder Project, which aims to essentially become a stacks project for category theory: <a href="https://www.clowderproject.com">https://www.clowderproject.com</a>.</p>
<p>It currently consists of 578 pages, with around 4000 more pages of material on category theory being slowly polished and converted into a form that works with Gerby. There are also 6000 more pages of material on other subjects which might eventually also make their way into it, as they either serve as either illustrating examples or stepping stones.</p>
<p>Here are some links:</p>
<ul>
<li>The website: <a href="https://clowderproject.com">https://clowderproject.com</a></li>
<li>The GitHub project with the source files: <a href="https://github.com/topological-modular-forms/the-clowder-project">link</a></li>
<li>Everything currently released in PDF form: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/topological-modular-forms/clowder-project-output/master/tags-book/alegreya-sans-tcb.pdf">link</a></li>

<p>hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276871">@Emily (she/her)</span> Congratulations! this is very impressive.  have you seen the project <a href="https://code4math.org/">code4math</a>? I think they would be interested in the Clowder project. I am also interested in perhaps connecting it to other math artifacts via <a href="https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/database">MathGloss</a> which is only now for undergrad maths.</p>

<p>Thanks. Indeed! I'm afraid I had seen the 1lab project before but had forgotten all about it. I think because we had decided to go for the undergrad maths domain, instead of the category theory one associated with TAC. it certainly makes sense!</p>
