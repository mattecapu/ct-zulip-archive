<p>Has anyone checked out this tool by <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45276501">leoyixing</a>?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi HN,</p>
<p>I’m the creator of Math2Tex. I was a PhD student, I spend a huge amount of my time working with LaTeX, especially when dealing with lecture notes, academic papers, and homework. I built <em>Math2Tex</em>, a lightweight tool that converts handwritten or printed academic content — especially math formulas — into LaTeX or text</p>
<p>The Problem:</p>
<p>I've always found it incredibly tedious to manually type out mathematical formulas, especially complex, multi-line equations from my handwritten notes or from a textbook. It's slow, boring, and I always make syntax errors. I tried some existing tools, but they often struggled with my handwriting or couldn't handle mixed content (text and formulas together).</p>
<p>The Solution:</p>
<p>So, I built Math2Tex to solve my own problem. It’s a straightforward, single-page web app: you upload an image (a photo of your notebook, a screenshot of a PDF, etc.), and it converts the academic content into clean LaTeX code or plain text. You get a real-time preview and can copy the result with one click. My goal was to make the workflow as fast as possible: Snap. Convert. Done.</p>
<p>You can try it here: <a href="https://math2tex.com/">https://math2tex.com</a></p>
<p>How is it different from general AI tools like GPT, Claude, etc?</p>
<p>This is a fair question. While large models can handle this, they are often slow for such a specific task. I wanted something faster and more specialized. Math2Tex uses a lightweight model fine-tuned specifically for academic content recognition.</p>
<p>In short, think of it as a specialized scalpel versus a Swiss Army knife. For this particular job, it's generally 3-5x faster and, in my experience, more reliable for complex notations.</p>
<p>Tech Stack:</p>
<p>The core OCR engine is a custom-trained model based on a transformer architecture, fine-tuned on a large dataset of both printed and handwritten academic material. It's all deployed on Vercel.</p>
<p><em>It's free to use.</em> This is still an early version, and I'm sure there are plenty of bugs and areas for improvement. The recognition might not be perfect, especially with very messy handwriting or some obscure symbols.</p>
<p>I would be incredibly grateful for your feedback. Whether you’re a student, researcher, or someone who’s fought with LaTeX input. Feedback on both the tool and the approach would be really helpful.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>If people were using ChatGPT etc for this task before I suppose I'm glad there's a more efficient solution out there for them.</p>
