<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276656">@Valeria de Paiva</span>  I mean the archive of the categories mailing list. Already the post-2009 mails are nearly lost: some of them are preserved in the Internet Archive's sporadic scrapes of the Gmane servers, but with no consistent url choice. It's not clear if all of them survived. The early ones are neatly curated, and everything from 1990–2009 is stored in big text files complete with email headers, one file per month.</p>

<p>There was <a href="https://meta.mathoverflow.net/q/4578/4177">concern at MathOverflow meta</a> over old links to the Gmane domain, since that broke (and now seems only accessible using nntp protocol, and via a different TLD address). I easily found four published books on the first page of Google search with Gmane urls in references, pointing to specific emails on the list, including one published this year.</p>

<p>There is a lot of good historical and mathematical information from pioneers in the field on there, including observations not recorded anywhere else. So I hope someone with the skills can hook up to the Gmane servers and extract the last 10 or so years worth of posts (though of late, this list is functionally dead), if they are there, and then host the whole history somewhere accessible and searchable.</p>

<p>Thanks for the explanation. I thought the back ups were ok before and never really looked. I was furious when Hypatia went offline some 20 years ago. It isn't even on Wikipedia, a shame.</p>
<p>I wish I knew someone which the ability to extract those  emails from the Gmane servers, no one comes to mind at the moment. I totally agree that the work there should be preserved.</p>

<p>It would be great having an index of <em>This Week's Finds</em>.  I'm going to start writing more polished articles on some of the recurrent themes, but that's a bit different.  I also want to put <em>This Week's Finds</em> into a PDF file on the arXiv.  Jason Erbele was starting to LaTeX them, but it's a big job and he soon gave up.  I'll probably do something less difficult.</p>
<p>I guess you know there's a <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/twfcontents.html">table of contents of the first 239 issues</a>.   I got tired at that point and quit.</p>

<p>this thread is interesting at many levels:</p>
<p>** how to preserve network content. categories mailing list is an easy early web community product: you just need to find it and save it. but some people maybe talk about thinkgs worth remembering here on zulip. there are in the meantime many versions of "proprietary email" (as whit diffie calls them). some platforms for social, scientific, dating interactions are provided for free, and they "maintain free services" by collecting data for advertising, campaigning, credit rating. (can a theorem that you mentioned on facebook be used to predict your political afiliation?)</p>
<p>** note the name of <em>hypatia</em>. libraries are sometimes murdered for a purpose. we know 5 tragedies by aeschyllus, and i think about 80 titles, but there were allegedly 200 of them in the catalog. one more godless than the other. destroying the web as the tower of babel will undoubtedly become an attractive proposition. eg to disrupt a global conspiracy of category theorists. and it might be not as hard as it used to be. the original internet was designed to survive the fragmentation in case of a nuclear war. but a network resilient to fragmentation is suboptimal for monetizing...</p>
<p>** memory is based on forgetting (cf funes the memorious). if you record all that happens, it all becomes noise. how should the web select what to remember? ants amplify shorter paths using pheromons. dropbox can drop unused links...</p>
<p>QUESTIONS:</p>
<p>1) what might be a good architecture for a community to store old archives. should everyone donate a bit of memory, and someone writes a simple private cloud module? also multiparty?</p>
<p>2) how should a network version of long term memory be managed?</p>
<p>thoughts?</p>

<p>See for instance the evaporation of Google+. For example: I'm glad Lieven le Bruyn saved his posts working through the complete details of a Frobenioid and re-hosted them on his blog, but this is merely one example among many excellent mathematical discussions that  are now either gone, or saved in a zip file on someone's personal computer, if they were diligent in saving their timeline before the end.</p>

<p>great, yes, the functions of IPFS are definitely needed. but as far as i can tell, IPFS seems distributed and anonymous, but is it really resilient? could i not seed it with malware from within that would, say, flood and overload all nodes? can it be resilient without any form of reputation or authentication? but yes, a persistent memory will have to be some sort of ledger. is that an interesting question to pursue? seems like a question thst naturally leads into categorical crypto :) as a security proof would need to be at 3 levels at least</p>

<p>very good! so i ask myself: is the problem not already solved by <a href="http://archive.org">archive.org</a>, arxiv and libgen? i use all 3 every day. why do i then ask this question? well, in theory at least, each of them could be sold to elsevier. they are not distributed. but it also gives rise to a more serious question. is there a solution that will not take into account the incentives? who has an incentive to maintain public goods. ((BTW, for that reason the projects that are concerned with privacy seem to be going in a different direction.))</p>

<p>That is the social service project I've taken upon myself, although from the comments on this thread I see I need to up my game. I help several different groups of yogis preserve their work. I live in Eugene, Oregon in the North West US. This is one of the richest bioregions in the world, and as a result it supports more endangered native languages than anywhere in the world.  Lots of potential good technical service projects.</p>

<p>IPFS is probably the most resilient way to store content right now, but I don't know how practical it is for a paper/math repo</p>
</blockquote>
<p>great, yes, the functions of IPFS are definitely needed. but as far as i can tell, IPFS seems distributed and anonymous, but is it really resilient? could i not seed it with malware from within that would, say, flood and overload all nodes? can it be resilient without any form of reputation or authentication? but yes, a persistent memory will have to be some sort of ledger. is that an interesting question to pursue? seems like a question thst naturally leads into categorical crypto <span aria-label="slight smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="slight smile">:slight_smile:</span> as a security proof would need to be at 3 levels at least</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For sure you can host malware-laced files on IPFS, exactly as you can do on bittorrent or with the PDFs you host on github. For me "resilient", in this particular case, means "decentralized". Which means that as long as at least one person seeds the files, it cannot be shut down. The issue of hosting community, "public" files on platforms as arXiv and github is that they are owned by someone, be it a university or a private company. And this someone can decide to shut everything down and leave everyone hanging.</p>

<p>You may say "well, arXiv won't shut down all of a sudden destroying all of its logs forever" and I agree, but still, I prefer to use something that can mathematically guarantee me that this does not happen instead of having to trust some institution. So for the real "public" stuff (as in "owned by the community") p2p file networks as IPFS are the only reasonable and "ethical" way to go.</p>

<p>i just said above that arxiv and archive are not a solution because they can be sold to elsevier. and i also appreciate the information that you can always store PDFs on github. but the IPFS design assumption, that there is no need for trust because there is no trusted 3rd party, is very naive. resilient could only mean decentralized if attacks had to be centralized. are you in contact with the IPFS designers?</p>

<p>Well, what I mean is that, for instance, GitHub does not really test for malware in the repos you host. So from the point of view of using a repo as a possible attack vector, I do not see IPFS as less secure than other solutions.<br>
Can you give me an example of an attack using the decentralized nature of IPFS to succeed? I'm not sure I'm really understanding what you mean by "attack" here</p>

<p>The immediate progress is that Grant's reaching out to me finally spurred me to figuratively get off my butt and get on zulip.  I'd say the first three TWFs are <em>done</em>, and two more are "basically" done, only needing ASCII graphics to be redrawn in TikZ.  So "the first 5 or so" was actually remarkably accurate.  I did a bit of Spring cleaning, so the Overleaf project I started for TWF is a little bit more organized than it was a week ago, but it'll probably be later this month when I'll have time to make another appreciable dent.</p>

I don't have any objections, per se, but I don't see what the advantage of github would be.  And a major obstacle would be that I don't know how to use github.  The project is on Overleaf, which is a collaborative platform with version control already, plus it has the LaTeX compiler built in.  I can supply a link that anyone can use to join and edit.<br>
But first, I need to get some sleep – it's already 7am here.  <span aria-label="grimacing" class="emoji emoji-1f62c" role="img" title="grimacing">:grimacing:</span></p>
