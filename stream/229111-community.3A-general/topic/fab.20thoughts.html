<p>well, you raise an interesting point: programmers expect any arbitrary object (of a certain type) to be storable as data, which basically means its countable; physicists expect an object to actually exist in the universe, somewhere (possibly inside a black hole); and mathematicians almost always work with descriptions of objects (not encodings of objects), and a large part of the trick is relating different descriptions of the same object, which requires proofs of arbitrary complexity, not just computation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is false. I don't know many physicist that believe Dirac deltas and plain waves exist in the universe. Still, they are object that they use almost all the time.</p>

<p>Ok, I managed to get to the end of this conversation. I'd like to question the most basic assumption: I don't think programmers feedback loops are better than mathematicians. I mean, maybe they are when you think about programmers as "people trying to implement research in type theory", but that's really a small subset of what's out there.</p>

<p>Usually people dig into your code and correct it only if they really need it. Github is full of repositories no one cares about. Also, the mole of code out there is really - really - humongous. If the "virtuous feedback loop" you are talking about would really exist, we would need many times the number of programmers we have to perpetuate it.</p>

<p>What we have, instead, is that code is often - even in industry - barely tested, or tested inadequately, and the result is that you have to turn a Boeing plane off every 50 days or so otherwise it crashes (in the literal sense of crashing and exploding, it appears). <span aria-label="shrug" class="emoji emoji-1f937" role="img" title="shrug">:shrug:</span></p>

<p>Also, dependent types and formal verification fix this up to a point. The typechecker will check that your code is formally correct, but not that it's conceptually correct, because it doesn't know anything about what you are trying to implement. It happened to us sometimes (even if very rarely I have to say) that we wrote some code in Idris that typechecked, but didn't work as expected. What happened in that case was that the conceptual premises we started from were actually wrong, and we ended up implementing a piece of code that did the wrong thing.</p>

<p>All in all, I believe that the idea that "programmers have a way better feedback loop" is largely a mathematician delusion. Writing code is hard, writing good tests is hard and time consuming, and everyone has already too much on their plate to really care about deeply analyzing and peer reviewing other people's code. Exactly like in maths. <span aria-label="slight smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="slight smile">:slight_smile:</span> This idea works - more or less - only if you think about stuff such as "I wanna use a typechecker to check that a mathematical proof is correct", wichi is more or less what Voevodsky wanted to do with univalent foundation.

<p>It is not a mathematician's delusion. This is speaking from extensive contact with people who work in the industry (and NOT in startups).</p>

<p>That is true only in startups and places where people believe in "move fast and break stuff". Seriously.</p>
<p>Testers exist. These positions are well advertised. I personally know a former academic whose main role in his corporate role now is to review code. These roles exist. People get paid to do this.</p>
<p>Compare that to academia, where all the emphasis is on churning out new "code", and the bare minimum lip service is paid to QA. Yes, it's exactly like maths, because maths behaves like the startup world!</p>

<p>And yes, peer review process in academia has a lot of problems because it nearly always happens on a volountary basis, so it amounts to ask people with already a lot of work to do to do even more work which, by the way, doesn't give you any form of credit.</p>

<p>Nobody pays people to "test" proofs. There's this honour system that bars people from getting paid. That's a problem, because this "testing" gets farmed off to people who're ill-equipped to do rigorous testing.</p>

<p>You started by making comparisons between programmers and mathematicians, saying that programmers have a virtuous feedback loop that mathematicians do not have. And I said that I don't think this is true, and that the case of serious code testing is actually a very small minority of what happens in the programming community. Now you say that you were talking about making review process better, which I understand, but that's a completely different thing which, imho, is totally unrelated to what happens in programming. We can talk about that, for sure</p>

<p>We brainstormed for some months about what's the best way to set up a peer review process, and it's no easy task. But of one thing i am sure, the right incentives are not economic, nor involve imposing a super formal framework for researchers to follow</p>

<p>I would agree that the right incentives are not <em>just</em> economic, but the current economic incentives are out of whack. I'd want an incentive structure that aligns with the stated goal of producing research of good quality.</p>

<p>Hi, I don't think I want to weigh in on this. What I want to say is that I think some are getting a little too comfortable on this server. There are 800 people on here that can see everything you're saying. This is not a chat room; this is a place for mathematical discussion and research. Tangents are okay, but if they don't lead somewhere productive then let them go.</p>

<p>I've not yet been nearly proactive enough yet to help the server -- we have a nice stream structure laid out waiting to be implemented, and there are guidelines we've recognized as necessary that we haven't yet made clear to the community. I apologize for being slow with this stuff. Part of the issue is being <em>overwhelmed</em> -- I think many members may have have shied away from the server because there is such a flood of messages. Online communication comes easier to some than others, and we need to respect this.</p>

<p>Everybody who has embraced this and quickly found their voice on here, that's awesome. You're having great conversations, and it's exciting to see. I only ask:   When you have a long discussion on here, please pause and make sure that it is benefiting everyone. Pause and think to write condensed paragraphs rather than stream-of-consciousness, and if you can try to limit the short "chatting" back and forth like in person. These kind of things will have to be incorporated into the guidelines, but most of all they'll have to be absorbed by each member as the best practices for everyone. Otherwise, we could lose members and this will just become dominated by those that talk the most. Just take it easy... we will likely have this server for a long time. It will become a great place as we learn to use it right.</p>

<p>There's also a private chat functionality which I haven't personally road tested. When the argument or discussion is between so few people, perhaps that might be a more suitable place for it?

<p>Finally, my own two cents: I went to a public lecture by Eugenia Cheng in Edinburgh last year. One of the most exciting take-aways from that was a hope that the kind of work which is crucial to the academic world which currently goes largely unrewarded, might be granted more respect (in the context of this conversation, I'm talking about the process of reviewing papers, but there was a broad range of examples). The networking we're doing here is actually one of those things, even if you can't put it on your CVs! So be respectful; if you're feeling the heat, come back later.</p>

<p>I know, I hate that.  <span aria-label="upside down" class="emoji emoji-1f643" role="img" title="upside down">:upside_down:</span>  I've managed to get my head working pretty well after all these years, but whenever I try to program, every ten years or so, I need to learn a new language, and I spend all my time making stupid syntax bugs.</p>

<p>(Just thought I'd present the perspective of the mathematician who doesn't enjoy programming.  In principle I have nothing against programming: I can see that it could be great, and some of my best friends do it.)</p>

<p>perhaps this should be in #meta, but just a couple thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is nice at times to feel able to chat freely and just “talk” as you would in real life, with short messages and stream-of-consciousness. However, as <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275899">@Christian Williams</span> said, that’s not necessarily conducive to actual discussions about, well, math content. If people other than myself also see the appeal of having spaces to chat, though, perhaps we could have a convention where those topics would be followed by “(chat)”, and all other streams would be assumed to be as <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275899">@Christian Williams</span> described.</li>
<li>Emoji reactions provide useful features by showing public perception without joining the fray; maybe we could take advantage of that by having conventions here that “bystanders” to indicate when they think discussions are getting either too heated, or off topic, or anything else server-y (perhaps with different emojis for different meanings). For example, someone could react with 🌨 or ❄️ to messages like those at the tail end of the argument above, and this would indicate to the participants of the discussion that perhaps they should step back and “chill out”. Idk if mods can search by recent emoji reaction, but if they can, it could also help mods identify potential places where they should step in if things progress. So, point is: designating specific conventions of meaning (and thereby function) for emoji reactions in the CoC or somewhere might help the public collectively “self-moderate” to an extent.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are good ideas, thank you. It's fun to start thinking of the emojis as signals.</p>

<p>My apologies to <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="276438">Fabrizio Genovese</span>. This whole discussion started with a grumpy misunderstanding that got grumpier as the night wore on. As <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="277473">Morgan Rogers</span> has pointed out, it should have been ended a lot earlier, and I'm sorry it didn't.</p>

<p>Maybe it would be a good idea to move such conversations to <a class="stream" data-stream-id="229451" href="/#narrow/stream/229451-off-topic">#off-topic</a> either voluntarily or by mod - even if they're technically not off topic</p>

<p>Alternatively we could have some kind of "chat" stream where you're free to talk as much as you like. The thing about <a class="stream" data-stream-id="229111" href="/#narrow/stream/229111-general">#general</a> is it's the one thing everyone's subscribed to</p>

<p>Now that all misunderstandings have been cleared we can also delete these messages altogether</p>
