<p>What I'm curious about is how this differs from the category of "open games" that <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="275901">Jules Hedges</span> defined. The most recent iteration of that is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03656" title="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03656">here</a>, which Jules has <a href="#narrow/stream/229199-learning.3A-basic.20questions/topic/Composing.20optics/near/194658321" title="#narrow/stream/229199-learning.3A-basic.20questions/topic/Composing.20optics/near/194658321">characterised</a> as generalising from lenses to optics.</p>

<p>It's <em>always</em> safe to start out assuming that something from game semantics has no relation to something from game theory. It might do, but that would be a bonus</p>

<p>Sorry, I'm confused by this statement. Could you clarify how the definition of <a href="https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo:M#mipstar" title="https://complexityzoo.uwaterloo.ca/Complexity_Zoo:M#mipstar">MIP*</a> is game-semantic but not game-theoretic in nature? Per the definitions in the Complexity Zoo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>MIP*: MIP With Quantum Provers</strong></p>
<p>Same as MIP, except that the provers can share arbitrarily many entangled qubits. The verifier is classical, as are all messages between the provers and verifier.</p>
<p><strong>MIP: Multi-Prover Interactive Proof</strong></p>
<p>Same as IP, except that now the verifier can exchange messages with many provers, not just one. The provers cannot communicate with each other during the execution of the protocol, so the verifier can "cross-check" their assertions (as with suspects in separate interrogation rooms).</p>
<p><strong>IP: Interactive Proof Systems</strong></p>
<p>The class of decision problems for which a "yes" answer can be verified by an interactive proof. Here a probabilistic polynomial-time verifier sends messages back and forth with an all-powerful prover. They can have polynomially many rounds of interaction. Given the verifier's algorithm, at the end:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If the answer is "yes," the prover must be able to behave in such a way that the verifier accepts with probability at least 2/3 (over the choice of the verifier's random bits).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the answer is "no," then however the prover behaves the verifier must reject with probability at least 2/3.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Yes, anything where you have 2 players and you break the symmetry between them by considering one the "verifier" and one the "falsifier" is game semantics</p>

<p>An example of a complexity class that is game-theoretic in nature is NASH, which contains the problem of approximating Brouwer <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>ε</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\varepsilon</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">ε</span></span></span></span>-fixpoints</p>

<p>Seems like there's a bonus.</p>
