<p>My name is Ben Sprott and I am the inventor and developer at <a href="http://www.thecanonworks.com">TheCanonworks</a>.</p>
<p>TheCanonworks is a social media website that aims at helping people to form small research communities focusing on discrete subjects that interest them, organizing their reasoning about the world, and allowing for collaborative exploration of topics.  The site provides for the highest possible quality of interaction, while remaining quite loose in its structure and ease of use.  We believe that it will appeal to everyone, from accomplished Academics, to average people.</p>
<p>The site functions by organizing interactions according to how Academics interact through familiar Journaling Systems.  Furthermore, we believe that, by structuring interactions this way, average users will have an unparalleled experience of interaction with information, ideas and other people.  In short, interactions are structured through a voting process that ensures that people respond to each other strictly in the ways that Academics respond while citing each other in their publications.</p>
<p>I am inviting Academics to start to use the site, learn how it works, and begin training subsequent echelons of users and voters.  With a large number of voters, TheCanonworks will form an engine that will help people to have the highest quality of curated interactions.  This curation, we believe, will be a solution to the problems of division, misinformation, disinformation, foreign influence, and the assault on consensus which we are seeing around the world.  By becoming members of TheCanonworks, posting, replying and especially by voting, your efforts will directly aid in the bolstering of Democracy and Reason in your country and elsewhere.</p>
