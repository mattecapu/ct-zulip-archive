<p>The CT mailing list seems to be dormant these days. I am not sure what is going on, but the situation worries me. The mailing list was used to coordinate the activities of this community and is considered by everyone to be the official source of information -- and somewhat the metronome -- of conferences deadlines.</p>
<p>The problem may be solved, hopefully soon, but the reliability of the list has been steadily decreasing in the last years. Wouldn't it be an idea to think of alternative ways to officially communicate our conferences and important dates (such as the HoTTEST seminars, or the ItaCa ones?) I was thinking of something like an editable wall on the nlab, maybe with an RSS option. This would also move the moderation duties to a more distributed approach, and hopefully speed up the process. </p>
<p>What do people think? What should people do?</p>
<p>I encourage people to resist taking any concrete action before any form of consensus is reached.</p>

<p>At least two of the messages that I have sent to it did not go through. One being the Logic Colloquium announcement, the other being the ItaCa fest announcement. Today  I had informal confirmation that the mailinglist is not operating at the moment, but this is not at all the first time in the last two years that a message that I, or the ItaCa people, have sent does not get dispatched, or gets dispatched with enormous delay.</p>
<p>Since some may have little experience with the problem, let me sum it up. As many mailinglists the categories one is moderated. This means that when I send something to it, there's someone that decides whether the message is good enough, or relevant enough, to be dispatched. A number of times the ItaCa seminar hasn't been announced, or was announced AFTER it had happened, because of this. I am sure you understand this is far from being tolerable. With the logic colloquium this time, the message simply never appeared, and the situation is getting less and less acceptable with the time.</p>
<p>While I understand the importance of moderation, and I am sure this not voluntary censorship, it ends up being...  censorship.</p>

<p>I agree, but let me make a couple of comments. (1) RS is not centered around us, nor there is a way to send a mail to a group of people that would like to receive one on the topic (I think). (2) Zulip is a lot of things, and I think could be an interesting solution, but it requires people to subscribe to it, and check it regularly. It is not as accessible as a simple, standalone webpage that gathers this information in a clean, dedicated, non-noisy, and uncluttered way.</p>

<p>Functional communities are rarely pyramidal structures. I think opening a nlab page is encouraged (I was about to tag him, but... Urs is not on this zulip?!) and in no way harms other initiatives that people might want to take in parallel.

<p>How do you think the nlab idea could work? Just a normal page with a anti-chronological list of announcements? And how about the RSS option? Is it possible to "subscribe" to an nlab page? Would you send a mail to Urs so that he sees this conversation?</p>
<p>One could even imagine a github website that self-updates when receives a specific mail-form that triggers it, and also dispatches a new mail to "the people". I guess this is something not too hard to automatise, no? Actually this is essentially what a google group already is.</p>

<p>I can look into it and email Urs later today, but I agree with you that we should give some time to more ideas to emerge from this conversation. I was just stating my opinion, that I would open the page now, even with just the title ("upcoming events in category theory") and think about the details later.</p>

<p>As such, a nlab page with a markdown table with all the technical information (venue, deadlines,...) maintained by the organization of each event, is not only completely harmless, but a huge improvement from the email format.</p>

<p>Thanks!  I <a href="https://nforum.ncatlab.org/discussion/17289/category-theory-events/#Item_1">started a conversation on the nLab</a> about both issues: is there a problem with the category theory mailing list, and is it a good idea to start an nLab page announcing events.   (Of course if one gets started, it will be up to people who care about it to actually use it: one can't expect that "they" will do anything.)</p>

<p>I hope the mailing list can be revived, much moreso than that some new solution can be constructed. A Schelling point around which a substantial proportion of the community has gathered for 30 years is unlikely to be successfully replaced.</p>

<p>Some people here might also be on the ALG-TOP list, which is also having impending technical problems, but at least the moderator let people know something was up in advance, and is keeping people informed as to the options he has. This is not to point a finger at Bob R, but he might not be so active in engaging with the list and its technical underpinnings to keep up with things that might be happening under the hood.</p>
<p>A google group mailing list (like eg HoTT people have, or constructivenews, is not at all unreasonable to my mind. Having announcements in one's inbox, and even discussion, is preferable to me than to have to navigate to yet another website to check regularly for updates.</p>

<p>The <em>reasonable</em> course of action is that the colleague at Macquarie reveal their identity, participating to this conversation, and the people who are willing to help revive the CT mailing list, also help relieve them from the burden of maintaining the mailing list alone. I can imagine the colleague at Macquarie is worried about not being able to juggle their role as maintainer of the community "official" mailing list, in addition to their teaching duties, supervision, research, role as reviewer of papers... <br>
But the solution is simple, we can help. As I said, functional social structures are rarely pyramidal.</p>
<p>As for the <em>unreasonable</em> course of action...</p>

<p>I believe this place is much better suited for the job the mailing list was trying to do, i.e. (1) announcing events and (2) discussions. I don't think there's any need to argue for (2): chats &gt;&gt; emails for that. Regarding (1), I see the value of having a low-tech, denoised way to keep track of them.<br>
An easy-to-implement solution, which would cather to both Zulip users and non-users, is to have a stream here, such as <a class="stream" data-stream-id="229141" href="/#narrow/stream/229141-general.3A-events">#general: events</a>, with writing access restricted to mods, who would take care of broadcasting (and filtering) announcements people send them, not unlike Rosebrugh used to do. Then getting emails from it would be a matter of enabling email notifications for that. One could even pipe such emails into the existing mailing list.</p>

<p>There's literally no solution to this. It's a huge problem for everyone. It won't get solved unless one of these solutions gets a state of monopoly.

<p>Concerning announcements of meetings, there is also &lt;<a href="https://mathmeetings.net/">https://mathmeetings.net/</a>&gt;.  Transitioning the mailing list to a new host and/or new maintainer may be the best option, since the proliferation of different platforms (nForum, nLab, MathOverflow, Zulip, Discord) makes it harder, not easier to keep track of everything.</p>

<p>this community has settled on Zulip, but the algebraic topology community uses Discord, and the HoTT community used to use IRC, some more FOSS-centric communities use GitHub discussions, or Gitter</p>

<p>I don't think it's accurate to say that any community defined by a mathematical subject "uses" or "has settled on" any particular communication app.  Most discussion on this Zulip takes place between a handful of regulars, and there are lots of category theorists who don't belong to it at all; and category-theoretic conversations also happen at the nForum, on blog posts, and (I gather) on twittery places.  I suspect the same is true for algebraic topology.  And as for HoTT, I think it's fair to say that I've been a member of that community essentially since its beginning, and this is the first time I've heard that that "community" used IRC.</p>

<p>One of the wonderful things about email is that it is a <em>protocol</em> rather than an <em>app</em>.  So one person can use gmail, another can use outlook, etc., and wonder-of-wonders they can still all communicate with each other.  Back in its day, IRC was a protocol too.</p>

<p>I suggest that anyone who wants an nLab page on category theory events create the page <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/category%20theory%20events">[[category theory events]]</a> and putting some information on it.  It's easy to do and it can evolve organically: e.g. if people create a mailing list this page can switch to giving instructions for joining that.</p>

<p>Seeking consensus can work when there is a clear authority who sets the rules under which that will happen and a time frame for it to happen in, and who will decide what to do if consensus is not reached.  But since no one is "in charge of category theory", I think waiting for a consensus to emerge would, as John said, probably lead to nothing ever being done.  I think this is rather the sort of situation where people who are willing to go beyond talking and take action can reasonably be allowed the resulting influence over the direction taken, as with many other community projects such as wikis and open-source software.</p>

<p>Of course this field has a Gotha (and to great extent, it's even ok). There's no point in dis-acknowledging it. As many of the hippie-like/very optimistic things that you often say, it totally sounds like "Qu'ils mangent de la brioche" to me.</p>

<p>I think it is true that the people who are willing to take action are the most likely to gain influence (essentially tautologically). However, I think it is possible to have democratic consensus without an authority, for instance if someone (i.e. one of those willing to take action) proposes a course of action before taking it, and gives (a specified period of) time for people to respond. (One might call such a person an "authority", but any person has the opportunity to propose or respond, so they are not an authority in the usual sense.)</p>
<p>There is much more that could be said on this topic, but I don't think having an argument about consensus serves any purpose now that action has been taken. While I do think this choice is likely to cause issues later down the line (albeit not in the near future), I agree it resolves the immediate problem.</p>

<p>Mike, this comment is ridicolous. Three people volunteered to address the issue; only, we avoided to take any concrete action, out of respect for what is (at least in theory) a democratic inspiration for our community. The rationale behind the inaction wasn't laziness, but avoid offending some old fart who might have thought we aren't old enough, influential enough, australian enough to be the coordinators of the official category theory mailing list. And I agree, we are none of these things.</p>

<p>Thank you all, anyway, I learned that the next time I notice something being dysfunctional and I want to fix the problem, I should just single-handedly do it, and if it appears bossy, it's your problem, not mine.</p>
<p>Also, two things to dispel any possible misunderstanding:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I am unironically glad that someone took the matter in their hands, and I am sure they will do a fantastic job. <br>
What I am not glad about is the lack of communication (who knew the mailing list was literally down and inaccessible, before this thread?) on top of another layer of lack of communication (who knew someone was addressing the issue already?). And icing on the cake, when some public discussion arises in absolute good faith, someone has the courage to say "well, if we just seek some consensus no one will ever do something concrete". Like, hello? Do you see me? I am in the room with you. <br>
...and icing-on-top-of-the-icing, "there is no one in charge of category theory"? Clearly someone is, as this situation shows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I said "old fart" because I have respect for competence, good faith and common sense. I have no respect for seniority alone, and disdain for narrow-mindedness.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>I believe this was not the problem <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276092">@Nathanael Arkor</span> was pointing at. Unexpected things happen all the time (see for instance Leicester a couple of years ago) and it just seems safer to not rely on a single university.  And just to be clear, I am not saying that in the foreseable future it is likely that category theoriests will not be at Macquarie, I just think there are better options long term. I think someone suggested something like a google group which seems like a good idea to me, but I am definitely not an expert on the topic. Finding the best option for this seems very useful to me.</p>

<p>My anger has literally nothing to do with feeling excluded. I don't feel more excluded than I usually do. What I find disturbing is that the people in the know couldn't care less about the people that are less in the know and want to lend a hand to address a dysfunctional situation. On a sociological level this is completely understandable, it's a typical mistake of older/more influential members of a community to override the natural dialectics that follows from multiple opinions in the same room. It's the dual mistake to the one made by many young people, believing that they know how things work and wanting to make the world better with energy and enthusiasm. So, I understand that everything was done in perfectly good faith, or I am totally willing to give the benefit of the doubt. What worries me is that the general issue goes completely unnoticed or even worse, that I have to avoid being gaslighted with Keanu-Reeves-esque moves by sentences like "no one would have raised a finger, if a small subgroup of the community didn't single-handedly decide to get in charge of things". That's false, and reading it is offensive, to say the least. That's why I used the word ridicolous. It's absurd, untenable, and offensive. Anyway, despite what it might seem, I have a thick skin, so I don't really care how we address the issue provided we solve it.</p>

<p>What I do care about is to raise my voice when I see that a behavior in the community I'm a part of is bossy and potentially exclusionary. The risk, otherwise, is that we legitimately try to get rid of toxic behavior in some parts of the community and we don't see others. The official mailing list of category theorists is indeed an official channel. I would like it to host healthy and useful conversations on the topic of the mathematics I love, I would like it to advertise in a timely manner events about it, and I would like it to be administered transparently, by responsive, competent and professional people. I think it's the bare minimum to ask</p>

<p>FYI I'm setting up a mirror of the mailing list here. It works one-way only, but at least it can be used to automatically broadcast announcements to this community too, and even move them to other streams like <a class="stream" data-stream-id="229141" href="/#narrow/stream/229141-general.3A-events">#general: events</a> or <a class="stream" data-stream-id="245502" href="/#narrow/stream/245502-general.3A-positions">#general: positions</a> to halve the amount of effort someone has to do to advertise their event to the CT community.</p>

<p>For those not on the CT mailing list: let me pass along Ross Street's nice little prehistory of that mailing list:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Bob [Rosebrugh]:</p>
<p>Far away in time and distance from most of your readers Max Kelly, in Australia, decided to make a mailing list of category theorists he knew from conferences; I contributed some more people. The list was typed on a golfball IBM typewriter. When we had a preprint or two (and once, a "Christmas Letter''), we would photocopy the list onto sheets of address labels, put the preprints in envelopes, and mail them using the reliable postal system of the 1970s.</p>
<p>Once we sent the list itself around too. Mike Barr wrote or said to Max: "What am I supposed to do with this!'' Max explained what we did. However, by then, word processors were around and Mike wanted an electronic version. We moved to that. The first word processor our Macquarie Mathematics Department secretaries used was called "OK editor'', not great. Of course then in came email and work stations and personal computers and TeX, . . . ; you know the story.</p>
<p>In 1990, you stepped in with prescient creations: a social medium for category theory and one of the very first electronic mathematics journals. What a debt our subject owes you!! You dedicated so much to running both magnificently. So easy to say "thank you'', and I do. However, with all the thanks flowing in, our joint appreciation should be clear.</p>
<p>It is a hard act to follow. Luckily, JS has stepped forward and already managed to have a replacement system up and running. I have full confidence that he will run it well, he is so bright and energetic. Moreover, I told the little story in the first paragraph to express my feeling of some satisfaction that the system has come to this far, distant land.</p>
<p>Surely now Bob, you will have a bit more time for research and other things. You deserve it.</p>
<p>With best regards,<br>
Ross   </p>

<p>There has been quite a high volume of discussion which I fear could degenerate into Twitter level discourse.  I hope that this is just the initial excitement of people and that it won't drown out more important announcements as so on</p>

<p>I think it might be useful to separate the mailing list into a discussion list and a anouncements list, like the TYPES list (the type theory mailing list) does. There's TYPES and TYPES-announce. Many other projects like Arch Linux also have separate lists for announcements and discussion, so for a high volume list like categories I think this is prefereable.</p>

<p>I think it would be a great exaggeration to call the categories mailing list "high volume". There have been a high number of emails recently only because the backlog of emails during the period the mailing list was down have been re-sent.</p>

<p>One of the barriers to entry for this zulip is requiring an invite link, and the invite links expire after a certain amount of time.  So if one would hope to get most of the CT mailing list community here, there would need to be a prolonged campaign to send out invite links to the CT mailing list... which would turn into spam, so I would not support this kind of action.</p>
<p>An alternative that I could get behind is a series of events that have coordinated with this zulip to have the web discussions taking place here.  The mailing list announcements for the CfP, etc. would mention that this is where the web discussions are held and include an active invite link, noting when the invite link expires and that a fresh invite link will accompany the next announcement for the event.</p>
<p>That said, I don't think it is <em>necessarily</em> a bad thing that the CT zulip and the CT mailing list serve different subsets of the CT community; the relative merits and demerits of that (present) fact would be worth considering if any effort is to be expended on "get 'em all over here".</p>

<p>Many of the regulars on the CT mailing list - e.g. the people who are busy thanking Bob Rosebrugh - will not want to come here.   Many of them are old, famous, and a bit set in their ways.  I imagine if they ever noticed this website they would regard it as a bit of an upstart, run by and for kids.   (Many of them consider me a kid too, btw.)</p>
