<p>Yes, it's a bit like his attitude to formal proofs (as I understand it) before he became enamoured of Lean. We need to do a bunch of stuff to see what happens. Formalisation is as close to experimental pure mathematics as one can get, I feel (pure numerical work in number theory notwithstanding).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I think the story is as follows.  Kevin was trying to formalize some stuff in Lean.  In doing so, he needed to prove some statements that clearly <em>are</em> theorems of Lean (and ZFC, and other non-univalent systems) but the proofs are long and inconvenient.  He asked what would be a covenient way of proving these statements.  Some HoTT enthusiasts suggested that univalence was the answer, because the proof of these statements would be trivial in HoTT.  So Kevin is asking these people to "put their money where their mouth is" by formalizing his stuff in HoTT.</p>

<p>This was arguably Voevodsky's motivation. He  didn't want to work with higher inductive types or other "synthetic" homotopy constructs until the models and their relation to standard constructions (e.g. standard model categories, etc) were fully worked out and understood (which now great progress has been made on).  So the system he worked in, iirc, was something like  MLTT + truncation + choice when warranted + univalence.</p>
<p>More generally, even in the presence of higher inductive types, I think it would be pretty shocking to get proofs of things _really_ not provable without univalence with the addition of univalence. If all it lets you do is "tighten up" equivalences into equalities, then anything you prove with it should be able to be "laxified" into something nearly the same, but with some extra equivalences lying about that can be proved without it.</p>
<p>Arguably the convenience it buys you is that once you get those equalities, then you have a straightforward way to apply transport along them.</p>

<p>Well, if your goal is to have 'generic mathematicians' jumping on the train, it's quite crucial that trivialities don't become cumbersome. Moreover univalence reflects much of the laxity the mathematical practice regularly employ, that is identifying equivalent objects</p>

<p>Maybe I'm misunderstanding what you mean, but you do need univalence to show that certain higher inductive types have the expected homotopy groups. For example, without univalence it is consistent that the circle is contractible, as the set model shows.</p>

<p>Yeah, univalence is essentially making the universe a higher inductive type, and without it, there's no accessible structure to do non-trivial 'large' elimination of other higher inductive types. So you're in a similar situation to where you can't prove disjointness of constructors without the universe.</p>

<p>You'd probably have to laxify all the HITs involved.</p>
<p>However, "someone could, in principle, write down all the structure and prove things without univalence," is a criterion that will probably always be satisfied, which I think was the point.</p>

<p>My confusion is, I suppose, that it is not clear to me that one needs univalence to rule out the set model.  My understanding, which I guess may be wrong, is that the presence of certain higher inductive types with sufficient elim rules alone (maybe ad-hoc large-elims per type) suffices. I should have thought through and specified what I meant by "HITs" in the above though.</p>

<p>Perhaps if there were a special principle for elimination into the universe that allowed you to provide equivalences for higher constructors to go to, that would technically allow you to avoid the exact univalence axiom. Although I couldn't rule out being able to prove univalence from that. It seems like that would be the same thing to a resistant mathematician, though.</p>

<p>Anyway, I shouldn't try to salvage my misstatement further :-). The point I should have stopped at is just that if one is not engaged in synthetic homotopy theory with HITs, then univalence largely just makes things "nicer". Once you have a richer univalent universe that you want to prove things regarding, then a priori one way or another you're going to be more with some set of axioms regarding that structure than otherwise.</p>

<p>I would argue that the purpose of HIT, beside synthetic homotopy theory, is to provide a non-axiomatic (and thus computable) definition of quotients and propositional truncations for instance. These were to some extend in previous systems : a strict version of propositional truncation is allowed in CiC by an inductive in Prop, and non-axiomatic quotients are available in Observational Type Theory if I understand what OTT is about. The  goal of HIT is then to generalize the theory of inductive data types to accomodate these examples. It happens that generalizing the theory of inductive gives us weird things like the Circle about which we may wonder the usefulness  <span aria-label="upside down" class="emoji emoji-1f643" role="img" title="upside down">:upside_down:</span></p>

<p>There was a pretty late paper or blog post on how you could add quotients to OTT. However, the work on the homotopy aspects of type theory leads to a more satisfying computational account of things like quotients (and funext) than might have been discovered for a very long time without it. </p>
<p>But the statement above was that Voevodsky was relatively content with MLTT+truncation+choice+univalence. And he wanted to do high dimensional mathematics that he thought was infeasible in set theory. My point is, I'm not clear how he would do that without stuff like HITs, unless it was entirely by proving things about hypothetical structures (which, maybe that was the plan, I don't know).</p>

<p>I would argue that the purpose of HIT, beside synthetic homotopy theory, is to provide a non-axiomatic (and thus computable) definition of quotients and propositional truncations for instance. These were to some extend in previous systems : a strict version of propositional truncation is allowed in CiC by an inductive in Prop, and non-axiomatic quotients are available in Observational Type Theory if I understand what OTT is about. The  goal of HIT is then to generalize the theory of inductive data types to accomodate these examples. It happens that generalizing the theory of inductive gives us weird things like the Circle about which we may wonder the usefulness  <span aria-label="upside down" class="emoji emoji-1f643" role="img" title="upside down">:upside_down:</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, that's totally backwards historically.  We invented HITs in order to construct things like the circle, and later noticed that they also gave quotients and truncations.  I guess from your emoji that you're aware of that, but I wanted to emphasize it in case anyone else wasn't.</p>

<p>My confusion is, I suppose, that it is not clear to me that one needs univalence to rule out the set model.  My understanding, which I guess may be wrong, is that the presence of certain higher inductive types with sufficient elim rules alone (maybe ad-hoc large-elims per type) suffices.</p>

<p>I don't know of any natural axiom that rules out the set model and doesn't imply some form of univalence.

<p>This is total speculation, but I could imagine not wanting to use HITs because the details hadn't been worked out. IIRC, the presentation of some of the HITs in the HoTT Book is a bit of a mess, given that some of the laws you'd expect to be definitional equalities are instead stated as mathematical equalities. I think those issues have since been fixed by moving away from globular assumptions, but I know at least <em>HIITs</em> are not really worked out yet.</p>

<p>Kevin on Lean Zulip makes some mathematical points that I cannot follow (as I am a (philosophical) engineer, not a mathematician). His argument seems to be that Undergraduate and Early Postgraduate Mathematics students don't need much more than what Lean offers. But I don't know exactly what those students learn. <br>
Could it be that as software engineers we benefit from using tools that require more advanced maths than what they learn at that level, or that we would benefit from tools using those? For example Linear Logic is entering programming through compilers such as Rust, Idris2 and modal linear logic with Granule, ... A lot of software engineers are embracing Rust for that reason, even if they never heard about Linear Logic. Is that something that the (under)graduate mathematicians come across? If not, then it may be that Cubical HoTT is very useful for programmers using Lean as a programming language (or Cubical Agda for that matter), even if not that interesting to mathematicians (at the level he is concerned about). For example if it would allow me to prove things on simple data structures and then transport those to efficient ones for the programs I want to compile, that may be a huge thing.</p>

<p>Very true!   One of the charms of category theory is its simple, direct character, and diagram-chasing is all about stringing together implications between collections of equations.  I think people who like category theory tend to love how much you can do with such simple reasoning.  Maybe people who don't like category theory find it "trivial" or "abstract nonsense".</p>

<p>The two I have seen is the introductory article <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3341691">Cubical agda: a dependently typed programming language with univalence and higher inductive types</a> which starts off with how one can transport proofs from the inefficient but simple unary representation of natural numbers to the efficient binary number representation used by computers. I can see a lot of applications of this. Eg. RDF has a simple graph structure, but there are many different encodings that have better efficiency characteristics for search, updated, etc...  <br>
Also I found his talk on <a href="https://twitter.com/bblfish/status/1317560817026535424">conatural numbers</a> very easy to follow, and there he shows how it ties in nicely with the Agda codata types.<br>
In programming the most important application of monads is for Input/Output and effects (where linear logic comes in).  So I look forward to some awesome tools emerging from  2-level type theories used for the development of Modal HoTT <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/two-level+type+theory">see nlab page</a>... But that is still in development, which should give me some time to catch up :-)</p>

<p>I'm a CS person (an engineer, I've exactly zero formal training) who did some work to generate Agda from Rust types where we did some “proofs” in Rust's type system. One of those things was to prove some impossibilities vis-á-vis carving up the bits of a 32-bit unsigned integer as it represents fields in a register. I based most of the proofs on <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="double-struck">N</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{N}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68889em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathbb">N</span></span></span></span></span> and wrote an injective proof to round trip <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="double-struck">N</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{N}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68889em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathbb">N</span></span></span></span></span> to my base-2 numbers and back, but was too lazy to add the truncation (not in the HoTT sense, but literally to drop trailing zeros in the base-2 rep). This, I think, would have been made easier with univalence / HITs thanks to quotients on the base-2 side, making trailing zeros irrelevant. </p>
<p>I'm saying this all to say, those things that we say sometimes are “just engineering” or places where we “just need to turn the crank” could be made radically easier. I'm a firm believer that Voevodsky  was right even if I lack the capacity to properly understand why!</p>

It would be very interesting to write up or give a talk where you use HoTT to transport a proof from one structure to another. Perhaps that could get the Lean4 folks to take seriously both an implementation into Rust and the development of HoTT. (I mention Lean4 as it produces C code, and so having it produce Rust may not be such a big project, and someone did produce a Cubical version of Lean2).  <br>
Agda is far more advanced as it has an implementation of Cubical HoTT of course. (I actually wonder why Idris does not get closer to Rust as it has linear types, but it does not have Cubical). It looks like each language is missing some piece...</p>

<p>Yes, but Kevin is a mathematician, and he's not trying to write code to interact with AI in cars :-) So it may be that coinduction, cubical, and all these other features are really important in these process oriented use cases in a way that they are not in number theory.</p>

<p>To give a more specific reference to applications of Cubical Agda to programming, see the recent POPL paper of Angiuli, Cavallo, Mortberg, and Zeuner: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05547">https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05547</a></p>
<p>Here they show how to apply univalence (and the structure identity principle) to programming problems. An interesting aspect of this work is the way it shows that many applications of "parametricity" (in the Reynolds sense) in programming are actually redundant in the presence of univalence.</p>
<p>This is very good, because parametricity is in essence only a statement about definability (my program does the right thing because you can't use it in a way that makes it go wrong) --- hence any program correctness lemma that follows only from parametricity could in principle be invalidated if the program is interpreted in an execution environment where more "contexts" are possible. One answer to this problem is 'internal parametricity', but this is a priori a very .... bold direction to go because there is no reason to believe that models of internal parametricity actually say anything interesting about standard mathematics (as opposed to programming).</p>
<p>So, by showing how far you can get with just univalence, the authors increase the unity of ideas between programming and ordinary mathematics in a way that finally pays off from the CS perspective.</p>
