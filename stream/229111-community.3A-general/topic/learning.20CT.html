<p>Hi, my name is Bobby Tosswill.

<p>Hi Tarun! Wow, that's a very interesting group! My PhD advisor (this was a long time ago) did some mathematical work around the quantum Hall effect, so he's worked with operator algebras, which I picked up a bit while I was doing my PhD. Some operator algebraists are now working with more advanced category theory, so there's potential there.</p>

Yeah, it's actually kind of a funny story - one of my big interests is diagrammatic reasoning, and so unrelated to linguistics or category theory, I found his work with quantum physics diagrams. I kind of put it to the side, and then months later, I was having trouble at work (AI startup) trying to find a model for natural language that we could implement alongside our vector-based approach, and suddenly there he pops up again haha. I've applied for the Masters of Logic at the ILLC at UvA in Amsterdam, and Martha Lewis, who worked with him at Oxford is there, so something tells me I'm gonna keep running into Bob Coecke's work haha.</p>

<p>Yes, traditionally category theory has been considered quite an intimidating subject, but I can assure you many people in this group are doing everything they can to disprove this. In the end category theory is about abstracting stuff, but as such, each abstraction models things you can experience and observe in "everyday life". This is especially evident in applied category theory. I hope that with time we will be able to show everyone that it's not as hard as many people think!</p>

<p>I'm very convinced a great deal of CT complexity is not really there, it's just 'cultural'. Many mathematical topics which are considered more elementary than CT are actually more sophisticated in terms of ideas and reasoning (i.e. calculus is harder than basic CT, imho). Basic CT barely has any theorems!<br>
To be fair, this could be said of many areas of mathematics, albeit few have such a gentle learning curve as CT imho. Maybe there's a big Dirac delta at the beginning because of the diagrammatic reasoning, but after then it isn't steep at all (while, e.g., graph theory starts super-easy and then blows up)</p>

<p>As someone who's come into this field with a pretty limited maths background, I think that there are probably two main reasons why category theory can get a bad rap:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Because it has so many broad applications in higher mathematics, it's often discussed using examples from a wide range of these fields. Maybe if the learner isn't as comfortable with all of them, it can be easy to get lost. As in, let's say I'm comfortable talking about group theory, but know nearly nothing about topology as such. If I'm being taught about limits and the first example is from group theory, but the second is about topological spaces, I might just not catch the pattern, and then it becomes harder to follow everything. If that happens enough, you might just throw your hands up and say "it's abstract nonsense!"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think that the flexibility of CT can make it hard to keep track of as well. You start by talking about things in 1-categories, but then to introduce new gadgets, you might need to implicitly take advantage of 2-categories, without having been told what they are. The domains and codomains of things can also be flexible, which can rattle your understanding: I was just getting used to the idea that a functor brings objects to objects and morphisms to morphisms when suddenly I hear about hom-functors, and now we're having objects mapped to sets of morphisms. Just earlier in the <a class="stream" data-stream-id="229199" href="/#narrow/stream/229199-basic-questions">#basic questions</a> chat, someone was asking about cospans, and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span> says that you can define them as the morphisms in another category - keeping track of what remains steady and what can vary in a theory as flexible as CT can make your head spin.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>But again, I'm new to all of this, so take this all with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>In my opinion category theory is genuinely difficult because abstraction is genuinely difficult, especially if you're coming through the traditional route via algebra and geometry, which are already at a pretty high level of abstraction</p>

<p>Reasoning with points is definitely partly cultural, but I have a strong feeling that it's also partly innate as well - reasoning without points and only with morphisms feels like an "unnatural" thing that needs to be learned and practiced, to me</p>

<li>Because it has so many broad applications in higher mathematics, it's often discussed using examples from a wide range of these fields. Maybe if the learner isn't as comfortable with all of them, it can be easy to get lost. As in, let's say I'm comfortable talking about group theory, but know nearly nothing about topology as such. If I'm being taught about limits and the first example is from group theory, but the second is about topological spaces, I might just not catch the pattern, and then it becomes harder to follow everything. If that happens enough, you might just throw your hands up and say "it's abstract nonsense!"</li>

<p>I think this is the main reason, books like MacLane's speak in elfic if you're not an advanced math undegrad.</p>

<p>I orbited around categories for quite some time before they clicked, and in retrospective it was because by that time I accumulated enough math knowledge to understand many examples. Then you get on the train, and goes smoothly.<br>

<p>But as <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276438">@Fabrizio Genovese</span> said before, many catsters (especially applied ones) are trying to make CT more and more accessible. Two great examples are Seven Sketches by Fong &amp; Spivak, and Notes on CT by Perrone.

<p>Not to mention, if you're into programming then there are great resources that introduce you to category theory with immediate examples or applications in programming. I can't recommend Milewski's <em>Category Theory for Programmers</em> enough. Just about halfway through that book and I'm understanding all this stuff like never before. Not without any struggle at all, of course — but unlike with resources I tried previously, it doesn't get to a point where I find that I have to go learn some other math first before I can understand the examples of these ultra-high level abstractions being discussed</p>

<p>Yeah, I think I'm moving out of the "orbiting" stage just about now, which is a great feeling! Haha, I think maybe my lack of math knowledge might have interfered with my understanding the Dirac delta bit. And "elfic" is the perfect word haha!<br>
As to the more accessible bit, I completely agree! Most of the newer books are much better about introducing things to a non-specialist audience (trust me, during my orbit, I've read a good number of them haha). I really like Seven Sketches, and I think it does a great job of showing the applications outside of pure math, but when I started it, I didn't have the math background, and unfortunately, I don't know if they do enough to cover the basic gadgets first, so I'm excited to reread it again after I feel more certain of the basics! I'll also have to check out Perrone's Notes, thanks!</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275967">@Vinay Madhusudanan</span> , Milewski has a great talent for explanation, and I can't tell you how many times I've gotten confused with a topic and then went to the section in CTfP to see how he explained it, but unfortunately, I don't know any Haskell, so that's gotten in my way.</p>
<p>So far, I've found that some of the best resources for me have been Harold Simmons' <em>An Introduction to Category Theory</em>, Tai-Danae Bradley's <em>Math3ma</em> blog, and videos on Youtube by The Catsters, and this 16yo called "Fematika". Also, Barry Mazur's <em>When is one thing equal to another?</em> was really helpful for me to understand some of the motivations behind category theory. Btw, do you think we should make a discussion in <a class="stream" data-stream-id="229199" href="/#narrow/stream/229199-basic-questions">#basic questions</a> for this one?</p>

<p>That's interesting to hear, because I was told sometime in my undergrad days that you don't refer to a function as "<span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex"> f(x) </annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault" style="margin-right:0.10764em;">f</span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathdefault">x</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span>", as that refers to its evaluation at a point <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex"> x </annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">x</span></span></span></span>.

Also, do not focus too much on the exercises. They are notoriously very difficult, if you don't know this beforehand it can be a very frustrating experience. But I find MacLane writing style increadibly terse and insightful, hence I loved the book</p>

<p>Another book that completely blew my mind is Sheaves in geometry and Logic. It's quite hard and progress for me has been slow, but it really made a lot of things click. More importantly, for people like me that do not have any geometric intuition, it gave me for the first time a sense of how geometry works. Before going through it I could deal with toposes as logical entities, but all the things people were saying about their connection with topology etc made just no sense. After I finally understood! I cannot say I'm fluent in this, but at least the general intuition is there now!</p>

<p>If you have some mathematical background, another really nice introduction to category theory is Emily Riehl's textbook. When learning a new subject, I like to see lots of examples, and she has collected many good ones from math and computer science. The selection of topics is great too.</p>

<p>As someone who came into this with very little math background and tried hitting my head against it for quite a few months, haha, I've gotta say this is a great list - I think these are the resources that have been most helpful for me (along with Simmons's <em>Introduction to Category Theory</em> and a few others I'm probably forgetting). It's an intimidating topic to jump into, but I think as someone pointed out last week, that there's been a lot of work in the last few years to make things more accessible, and I'm very grateful for that</p>

<p>It just popped into my mind that also Aluffi's "Algebra: Chapter 0" is a great start if you know some 'classical' algebra and need to pick up on the categorical thinking. One only needs to go through the first 2/3 chapters if they are only interested in CT</p>

<p>I guess a funny point is that the objects of Set really do have elements in a category-theoretic sense. For a set X, the collection of morphisms f : 1 → X is in bijection with the elements of X (in the set-theoretic sense). This is a trick that comes up again, for example, in vector spaces, where given X a vector space over a field F, its “elements” are the linear maps of type F → X (with F seen as a vector space over itself). You can recover the classical notion of element by applying such a map to 1, and noticing that its action on arbitrary elements is determined by its action on 1. (Take f : F → X. Note f(x) = f(x × 1) = xf(1).) This notion is expanded fully at <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/generalized+element">https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/generalized+element</a>. An interesting quick exercise is to take the category of sets and <em>relations</em>, and work out what its elements – relations of type 1 ⇸ X – are.</p>

<p>I've never heard of information and possibility talked about this way for category theory, but maybe it's related to the notion of <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/stuff%2C+structure%2C+property">property, structure, and stuff</a>, which indeed is a useful intuition. You could say that how a property is constructed carries no information – the only information being whether it exists at all. To characterise via universal properties is a way to have structure-like things that are actually properties (because the universal property constrains them to be unique).</p>
