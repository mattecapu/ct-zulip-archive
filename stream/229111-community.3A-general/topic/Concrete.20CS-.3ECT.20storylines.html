<p>Hi, I did a PhD in motivic homotopy theory, but have been skipping around Homotopy type theory, non-classical propositional logics, the outskirts of number theory, like quadratic forms and the field with one element.

<p>There's been a lot of category theory done in computer science, but mostly in the programming language community. I had a look at the programming language team at Düsseldorf, but it seems like they're more interested in working with Prolog, so no luck there. </p>
<p>There's actually a story that's adjacent to your interest in HoTT: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_functor_(type_theory)">container/polynomial functors</a>, defined by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304397505003373">Abbott et al.</a> using Martin-Löf type theory to support generic programming in a dependently typed language, and then brought back to category theory by <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="276625">Joachim Kock</span> and others.</p>

<p>The specification language community, which is entirely separate from the PL community (it's complicated, don't ask) has also been using category theory for a long time. Their use of cospans for doing architecture diagram wiring goes back at least 20 years, for example. Then there's a huge cottage industry of people doing rewriting via double-pushout formulations. The models people (you can blame Zinovy Diskin and Tom Maibaum there) have also started to really get categorical.</p>

<p>Good to know. I was more interested in looking at the group that's at Peter Arndt's institution, which is <a href="https://www.cs.hhu.de/en/research-groups/software-engineering-and-programming-languages.html">this one</a>. I'm not really familiar with the work of the specification language community, so I didn't know how to see if they're using category theory in their research.</p>

<p>So I had another look at the presentation of your team, and it seems they're interested in NLP. So stuff to do with string diagrams may be helpful: <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="276692">Bob Coecke</span> and others have been using "categorical quantum mechanics" (CQM) to do semantics and <a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/QNLP2019/">"QNLP"</a>. <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="276656">Valeria de Paiva</span> is also a research scientist working on NLP in the industry, as well as having developed the theory of <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Dialectica+interpretation">Dialectica categories</a>.</p>

<p>Wow, cool, a whole thread on what I am looking for. And thanks for this very specific help tailored to my situation! <br>
QNLP might really be a thing for me - I will look into it!<br>
In general, researchwise, I don't have to do what the others at the department are doing, although it would of course be nice not to sit alone on my connected component. But realistically I will mostly be teaching in the next time, and ideally I would like to teach stuff that gets me into possible research directions. I think I have quite some freedom to offer courses about anything AI-related that is sufficiently applied. And I can also come up with other CS-related courses, but I may have to justify if I want to teach courses containing CT, and concrete applications are the most convincing, I guess...<br>
Since I like topos theory:  Is domain theory still a thing that people work on? And specifically synthetic domain theory?</p>

<p>you're welcome, Peter!  I was reacting to the idea that we need to preserve the old histories because the digital ones are sometimes harder to preserve than the printed ones--like the examples of  PSSLs, Hypatia and the categories mailing list archives discussed in other channels here show. But I am sure that there are plenty of other nice examples of connections between CT and logic programming that I don't know much about.</p>

<p>i dunno if i can tell you whether "people" work on domain theory but i know that <em>i</em> think it's pretty cool <span aria-label="halo" class="emoji emoji-1f607" role="img" title="halo">:halo:</span></p>

<p>Paul Taylor, at least, moved from synthetic domain theory to "<a href="https://www.paultaylor.eu/~pt/ASD/">abstract stone duality</a>" I think. And I suppose I'm not sure if he still works on that, but I think it's newer than his work on synthetic domain theory, for people looking for 'new' stuff to look at. (I'm also not sure why he didn't call it 'synthetic stone duality.')</p>
