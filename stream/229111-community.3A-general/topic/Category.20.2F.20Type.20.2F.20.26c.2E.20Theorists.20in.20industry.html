<p>Hey all, who here is not in academia, and what do you do?! I have worked in the formal methods space in the past, though, for the last 18 months or so have been doing something else entirely (happy to say more if anyone is interested). I’m curious what companies are out there in the FM space and what they’re up to.</p>

<p>Tough to beat <a href="https://galois.com/">Galois</a> and/or <a href="https://www.sri.com/cyber-formal-methods/">SRI</a> in industrial research on FM, though of course some of the largest information tech and aero/defense shops also do top-notch FM work. </p>
<p>My shop does some FM work (but I haven't done any here). DM me if interested.</p>
<p>Re: category theory, if I demonstrate a winning value proposition for large cardinals or Langlands or conformal field theory--or category theory--for something that my shop wants me to work on, then that's that. I have accrued a fairly large bag of hammers over the years and despite being an absolute (and relative) dilettante at CT I have been able to fruitfully use it in a few ways, not always indirectly.</p>

<p>I am in Portland, and know Galois well! I Interviewed for a job there ~5 years ago, but ended up staying where I was at at the time (<a href="https://auxon.io">auxon.io</a> (where I was last involved in the FM space)). As I think about returning because I miss the intellectual itch it scratches, I find myself interested in not just the theory, but the exposition it takes to turn the theory into a product.</p>

<p>The "entirely" is a slight exaggeration, the majority of the <em>work</em> is not doing category theory... at least not in any sense that most people here would recognise it. The majority of the <em>tech</em> is explicitly category-theoretic, although there's also a few bits where it needs to just go by any means necessary</p>

<p>Well, the tech stack is built on categorical research, implemented in Haskell, which is built on categorical research, and in any talk we give we mention at least en passant the categorical foundation of everything we do (esp wrt to using compositionality in prod)...</p>

<p>If industry includes practical open source repositories i wrote a very basic framework where ai models (or anything else optimizable) are morphisms and you can optimize various diagrams.problem is,me being neurodiverse and having issues,i burnt out/blocked myself out from using it but it's my first repo having some cloning activity.it's akin to the modeling work with algebraicjulia but much more simple and in python.julia sounds like heaven to learn but like i said,burnt out.</p>
