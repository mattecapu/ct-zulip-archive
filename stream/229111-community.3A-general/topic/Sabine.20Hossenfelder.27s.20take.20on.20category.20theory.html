<p>There's a general bad taste that this video leaves me with, I see the quality of Sabine's outreach degrading over the years, probably by the month. It is saddening that even someone with a PhD in highly abstract physics can derubricate category theory to some sort of void uuh buuh abstract jargon here's a diagram; and it is worrying that someone with a PhD in physics struggles to understand the meaning of "a complex algebraic variety, plus a closed semi-algebraic region whose interior is a d-manifold"</p>

<p>I didn't find this offensive; to summarize the CT-related part, she observes there was a burst of interest in CT in physics a couple of decades ago but that "nobody" thinks it's going to revolutionize physics anymore. Of course "nobody" is not a strictly accurate descriptor, the existence of Urs disproves the strict negation, but it seems like basically the normal situation that participants in a paradigmatic science predict that any given putative paradigm-breaker won't succeed in breaking the paradigm until it actually does. And the concern that excessive generalization via CT leads to the risk creating a "theory of anything" rather than a "theory of everything" seems like a very legitimate issue we have to grapple with in category-theoretic applications. Note that Sabine didn't put CT on her bullshit-o-meter or anything, and even explicitly agrees that it's useful in certain more abstract areas, such as presumably cohesive linear homotopy type theory.</p>

<p>this is an issue that has nothing to do with physics; in general, it seems to me people might misinterpret the content of category theory and its role in the mathematics of the past century, mistaking it for "some snake oil that was supposed to solve the problems of physics but in the end didn't"</p>

<p>I think this attitude is dangerous and prejudicial --especially for someone who listens to this video superficially, in passing (=the totality of people watching youtube); plus, as I said, the bad taste I've been left with after this inclines to think she doesn't get what CT is ultimately about (or wouldn't even when explained), given that she struggles understanding the keywords defining "positive geometry". </p>
<p>Generally, it is bad to let people who ignore what your work is about, but have a stage with followers, take it and talk about your work.</p>

<p>I concede I am maybe more irked than average by this trope (category theory seen as an ancillary tool to do X, but ultimately not powerful enough to truly tackle hard problems in X). Still, I think it's a sad misrepresentation to hear.</p>

<p>Product placement aside, I don't think the video is particularly too harsh on category theory. Sure, it clearly shows she doesn't understand it, but that's about it. Her critique was mostly about how it didn't revolutionize physics despite the initial hype. (Hype thanks to which, by the way, I heard about category theory while studying gauge theory, and pretty much never left.)</p>

<p>Personally I think that the main reason why high-energy physics is so stagnant is because the majority of the community, a long time ago, stopped being interested in figuring out <em>what is really going on</em>, and started just 'calculating things'. (Not everyone is like that, thankfully, for example Urs Schreiber is not.)<br>
With this attitude, no amount of fancy math is going to help, not category theory, not positive geometry, not non-commutative geometry, and so on: you just go from 'calculating' to manipulating more abstract symbols and shapes.</p>

<p>I see the same risk all the time in my work on probability: occasionally, just moving the right shapes in a string diagram <em>does</em> solve the problem, but that's not the point of categorical probability to me. After all, also analytic calculations would solve the problem. Category theory's value is to <em>help you understand</em> what's going on by focusing on the core ideas and removing all the pesky details. It's important, while manipulating abstract ideas, not to forget what we are trying to model.</p>

<p>(That, and let's also keep in mind that just because something <em>can be expressed</em> using category theory does not mean that <em>category theory will 'solve' that field</em>.

<p>It's always frustrating to see CT dismissed as essentially irrelevant, usually because of the popping of a CT hype bubble in some domain of application. I agree with Kevin's summary that she wasn't particularly harsh. What's most frustrating to me (which aligns with fosco's assessment of the degrading quality of Sabine's work) is that it doesn't seem like she made any effort whatsoever to look into whether CT did actually produce meaningful contributions to theoretical physics (such as what David mentioned) before dismissing it...</p>

<p>I won't watch the video: I quit paying attention to Hossenfelder when in February this year she did a video called "Academia is Communism," approvingly citing Musk, Marc Andreessen and Peter Thiel saying that universities are enemies of progress - without even mentioning that at the very moment Musk's DOGE team was chopping apart the US government, including the Department of Education.   (She could have at least celebrated that fact, if she thought it was a good thing.)</p>
<p>But I wonder why she said there was a burst of interest in category theory in physics 20 years ago but nobody thinks it's going to revolutionize physics anymore.   </p>
<p>In fact there's a lot more work on categories in physics <em>right now!</em>   Look at a few of these <a href="https://arxiv.org/search/?query=%22fusion+2-category%22&amp;searchtype=all&amp;abstracts=show&amp;order=-announced_date_first&amp;size=100">recent papers on fusion 2-categories in quantum physics</a>. This is the kind of thing I was vaguely <em>dreaming</em> about back in the 1990s!    It's all come true, but it's being applied to condensed matter physics instead of pie-in-the-sky quantum gravity.  Maybe that's why she doesn't know or care about it.</p>

<li>Thibault D. Décoppet and Matthew Yu, The Classification of 3+1d Symmetry Enriched Topological Order</li>
</ul>
<p>Abstract:  We use a 2-categorical version of (de-)equivariantization to classify (3+1)d topological orders with a finite  G-symmetry. In particular, we argue that (3+1)d fermionic topological order with G-symmetry correspond to  SuperVect-enriched  G-crossed braided fusion 2-categories. We then show that the categorical data necessary to define these theories agrees with that arising from a fermionic generalization of the Wang-Wen-Witten construction of bosonic topological theories with G-symmetry saturating an anomaly.</p>

</ul>
<p>We introduce a framework to define coalgebra and bialgebra structures on two-dimensional (2D) square lattices, extending the algebraic theory of Hopf algebras and quantum groups beyond the one-dimensional (1D) setting. Our construction is based on defining 2D coproducts through horizontal and vertical maps that satisfy compatibility and associativity conditions, enabling the consistent growth of vector spaces over lattice sites. We present several examples of 2D bialgebras, including group-like and Lie algebra-inspired constructions and a quasi-1D coproduct instance that is applicable to Taft-Hopf algebras and to quantum groups.  [...] Our results establish a local and algebraically consistent method to embed quantum group symmetries into higher-dimensional lattice systems, potentially connecting to the emerging theory of fusion 2-categories and categorical symmetries in quantum many-body physics. </p>
<ul>
<li>Daniel Teixeira and Matthew Yu, Mutual Influence of Symmetries and Topological Field Theories</li>

<p>We study how the fusion 2-category symmetry of a fermionic (2+1)d QFT can be affected when one allows for stacking with TQFTs to be an equivalence relation for QFTs. Focusing on a simple kind of fermionic fusion 2-category described purely by group theoretical data, our results reveal that by allowing for stacking with <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext>Spin</mtext><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>n</mi><msub><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mn>1</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\text{Spin}(n)_1</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord text"><span class="mord">Spin</span></span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathnormal">n</span><span class="mclose"><span class="mclose">)</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.3011em;"><span style="top:-2.55em;margin-left:0em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">1</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.15em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> as an equivalence relation enables a finite set of inequivalent modifications to the original fusion 2-categorical-symmetry. To put our results in a broader context, we relate the order of the symmetry modifications to the image of a map between groups of minimal nondegenerate extensions, and to the tangential structure set by the initial categorical symmetry on the background manifold for the QFT.</p>

<p>It is really frustrating to hear people disparage things they don't understand. I have heard people talk like this about category theory, and I have also heard category theorists talk about physics, logic and computer science in similar way. Of course some research programmes are inchorent or ill-motivated, but if you don't try to understand and learn, it is usually impossible to tell.</p>
<p>It is my belief that academia incentivises specialization to the detriment of breadth, and often-times a deeper understanding.  I can not understand when people seem to be proud that they don't know something because it isn't what they do.  Of course we can't know everything, but at least in principle I would like to know as much as possible.</p>

<p>People on Mathstodon have pointed out that comparing things to Chinese is a common idiom in Germany for incomprehensibility, making it the kind of cultural racism we all (to some extent or other) partake of, rather than conscious racial disparagement/othering, and that she was probably applying this to GPT5's attempt at an explanation rather than the concept since she continued trying to understand positive geometry and ultimately gave a 1/10 on the "bullshit-o-meter" where lower is lower-in-bullshit.  I can't defend her stance on academia-in-general but it seems like some of the complaints against this video in particular are overblown.</p>
<p>(It <em>is</em> important to call out the harmful effects of elements of cultural racism like this idiom, but it's also important to take it for what it is and not what it isn't and take a measured, empathetic approach if you actually want to induce change.  Being too accusatory and acerbic causes people to focus on themselves rather than the people who may be hurt by cultural racism.)</p>

<p>One may retain humility and gratitude despite a lifetime of rejection. We can show those in pain, such as Sabine and others, grace. </p>
<p>And let me just say, in dwelling with those on the periphery of mathematics (silicon valley tech types) for a few months this summer, it's quite obvious that the LLMs will try to convince you that category theory is the answer to all your questions. </p>
<p>There's a whole huge demographic of people who just came across category theory in the last year, and definitely not through algebraic topology. This demo is prone to believe they totally understand the depth of category theory after reading 1 intro book like Maclane (again, not algebraic topology or geometry or algebra etc).</p>
<p>However, they are for the most part very eager to learn, I decided to make a big signal group chat with every one of them that I met (and some of you are in it). I feel as though outright rejection of these folks causes lasting animosity, so I urge you to have grace despite their potential rudeness, reduction of the field, and unearned hubris. Have patience for the flip side as well: their category theory idolatry, saying that every problem is category theory (which it is but the reason why is so much deeper and none of us have touched it, maybe Grothendieck glanced upon it). </p>
<p>For among this demo are several serious people who have really surprised me with their natural grasp of the field, including some who are very young.</p>

<p>It seems to me the issue of people of displaying "grace" to people just learning category theory is largely orthogonal to Hossenfelder, since she's not teaching anyone category theory and probably not learning any either.</p>
<p>(Btw, I think Hossenfelder paid more attention to me, and also to category theory, back in the 1990s - back when I was more visible and loudly touting the possible applications of category theory to quantum gravity in my series <em>This Week's Finds</em>.   I don't feel she's been following the recent dramatic applications of category theory to condensed matter physics.)</p>

<p>It's not only about her, but about people who may identify with her.  It's important to make clear that the problem with this comment is:</p>
<ul>
<li>it may make people for whom Chinese is their native or ancestral language feel like some kind of alien life form rather than part of the audience; and</li>
<li>because there is some cross-cultural identification among people of an Asian (and especially East/Southeast Asian) background even people not of a specifically Chinese background may also get swept up into this feeling; and</li>
<li>this is all potentially exacerbated by the fact that in English this isn't even a native idiom that people would at least be somewhat inured to</li>
</ul>
<p>and not:</p>

<p>A behaviour can be racist (in the ways you have explained) or stupid. Racism and stupidity are no more of less than patterns of behaviour; making a racist comment, inadvertently or not, is one of the acts that constitutes being racist. So Matteo's comment was a description of the act: in making the comment, Hossenfelder was 'being racist'; in quoting directly from ChatGPT she was 'displaying stupidity' (according to Matteo, anyway). If "a lot of people" were to extrapolate from that assessment an unrepresentative broader judgement of Sabine Hossenfelder's character, that would be on them, not on Matteo.</p>

<p>I'm sure if someone else wanted to be defensive of Sabine, as you are being defensive of Matteo, they would say that "Chinese is merely a language that Sabine does not understand; if a 'lot of people' were to extrapolate from that any sort of attitude toward Chinese people, never mind Asians in general, that's on them, not Sabine."  In a diverse community, you cannot merely declare that your preferred communication style is the objectively correct one and it is everybody else's job to divine and respond to (only) your true intentions; you must make the effort to communicate in a way that so that others will understand your intentions.</p>

<p>Hi, not to harp too much on the issue, but Geometric Computability Theory was created precisely to fill this exact "gap in the market" for the "shut up and calculate" types like Sabine. It's a kind of "Constructive Computational Gauge Theory."</p>
<p>I've already got the manuscript outlining all that's really needed being reviewed at a respected Springer journal by the way. Once it's published, the complaints about the usefulness of CT in physics by this particular crowd should more or less start to go away by the end of this decade, so please, I ask you all just be patient. Hearts and minds don't change overnight.</p>
<p>If Dr. Sabine insists that our foundations for physics be based on a deterministic, computational, 4D theory, well then, I'm more than happy to provide her with such a research program, so she won't be able to complain about lack of alternatives in the HEP-th space anymore, I can assure you all of this. (The catch is that she has to learn what a geometric bordism is).</p>

<p>People on Mathstodon have pointed out that comparing things to Chinese is a common idiom in Germany for incomprehensibility, making it the kind of cultural racism we all (to some extent or other) partake of, rather than conscious racial disparagement/othering, and that she was probably applying this to GPT5's attempt at an explanation rather than the concept since she continued trying to understand positive geometry and ultimately gave a 1/10 on the "bullshit-o-meter" where lower is lower-in-bullshit.  I can't defend her stance on academia-in-general but it seems like some of the complaints against this video in particular are overblown.</p>
<p>(It <em>is</em> important to call out the harmful effects of elements of cultural racism like this idiom, but it's also important to take it for what it is and not what it isn't and take a measured, empathetic approach if you actually want to induce change.  Being too <del>accusatory and acerbic</del> causes people to focus on themselves rather than the people who may be hurt by cultural racism.)</p>
<p>EDIT: Further discussion has made me aware that Matteo may very well not have realised that his statements would come off as "accusatory and acerbic" to members of many English-speaking cultures, so expressing my objection to his phrasing in that way was a mistake.  I have, however, left it in under strikeout markers so the further discussion below would continue to make sense.</p>

<p>I might have been a bit too strong in my judgment, I agree! The use of that idiom is the smallest problem here.</p>

<p>She has, if not stated openly, at least strongly suggested that she is ideologically centre-right, strongly pro-capitalist, and sees academic knowledge as a commodity to be judged on grounds of economic value. These are extremely mainstream positions, but not very represented in academia; I think that it is broadly <em>true</em>, at least in our fields, that the academic community does not function on strictly capitalist grounds; there is a culture of <em>helping each other out</em>, sharing our funding with a colleague at risk of losing their job, investing <em>more</em> effort on a student who is struggling...</p>

<p>I think pure theoretical research does justify itself <em>on average</em> on economic grounds - meaning that the total investment in pure theoretical research is amply repaid by the benefits of a few lucky results of this research.   It's a bit like how investors expect most startups to fail and a few to succeed tremendously.   </p>
<p>I believe pure theoretical research could be done more "efficiently" if one were trying to maximize its economic payoff.  That is, I think there's some research that one could cut, and other research that one could spend more on.   But it would be hard to do this right.</p>
<p>However, I don't believe the sole justification of scientific research should be economic.   </p>
<p>I think eventually people will realize that economic advancement should be a tool to make people happier, and that other things can also make people happier.   Also, that pouring more wealth into the pockets of billionaires does not make people happier - <a href="https://cdn.bsky.app/img/feed_fullsize/plain/did:plc:56g2xmm4lqxztygzrvelvfnz/bafkreid2igdddz34sjkcnwqkth2f6fbaerli7ypn5jjkqrguzyxwjyau5a@jpeg">not even the billionaires</a>.</p>

<p>Indeed... I'm an unapologetic research maximalist, for a very simple reason: <em>we don't know which research threads pay off in the long term</em>. We might have a pretty good guess in the very short term, it's already just an educated guess in the medium term, and we genuinely have no idea whatsoever in the long term (an easy, if naive, benchmark for this, I don't think anyone manages to predict Nobel prizes 5 years in advance). If one starts 'optimizing' research funding, they would optimize according to the short term bias, and then everything would looks great until that short time elapses and alternative research programmes are not flowering because we didn't seed me in due time.</p>

<p>her first big public venture was advocating against funding new particle accelerators... I believe that this was misunderstood as being done on scientific rigour grounds (critique of string theory in the vein of Woit) when I think she was quite open about also contesting the value of such endeavours even if backed by good science...</p>

<p>This is quite funny because she bashes academics for being 'closed to new ideas' and yet she opposes an experiment to fish for new physics, on presumably theoretical grounds ('the math is too far fetched' or something) <span aria-label="shrug" class="emoji emoji-1f937" role="img" title="shrug">:shrug:</span></p>

<p>I was against the Superconducting Supercollider back when that was being built.  My thinking was that we'd only discover the Higgs and other things we were damn sure to find.   </p>
<p>In 1993 the US Congress quit funding the SSC and filled 22 kilometers of tunnel with dirt so nobody could continue work on it.  That seemed excessive to me, even at the time: it would have been a great place to grow mushrooms.</p>
<p>By the time people built the LHC my thinking had changed a bit.  I still figured it would only find things we expected - and I was right - but I'd realized that so much money is wasted on even more stupid things - like subsidizing fossil fuels - that 2.6 billion euros for finding the Higgs boson was not so bad.    In an ideal world that money could have gone into innovative theoretical particle physics and some brilliant young physicist might have figured out why the Standard Model is the way it is.    But the realistic alternatives would be: 1) less money to science or 2) money spent on physics fantasies that could only be squelched by actually seeing that <em>yes, the Standard Model is all we will see at the energies available to us</em>.</p>
<p>By now my thinking has changed even more.    I figure that the world is so fucked up that when people do anything mildly nice, like build a particle accelerator, that should be applauded.</p>
