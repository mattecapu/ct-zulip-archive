<p>Apparently Springer has been counting citations wrong for at least 14 years: it misleadingly assings many more citations to the first paper in a volume, skewing the metrics:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01675">Incorrect Citation Association for Articles in Online-Only Springer Nature Journals
Tamás Kriváchy</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Google Scholar and Crossref seem unaffected.</p>
<p>Alas, I'm finding myself forced to participate in the circus that is the academic publishing industry, specifically the Springer circus. I hope findings like this will convince more members of our community in positions of power to (a) lobby their institutions to stop paying money and attention to these companies, and (b) boycott their publications by serving as editors and/or publishing in independent, open access journals (we have a few egregious examples of these in CT, fortunately).</p>

<p>My coauthor on this paper that I'm shepherding through the Springer publishing process (not at ACS, but a journal not unknown to people here) wrote this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have to agree that on the whole it has been a pretty unimpressive job by springer (or their conduits). </p>
<p>It’s interesting that basically every aspect of this process has been uniformly worse than any previous experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The academic editor who we know well has been fantastic. The referee was great. The publisher as an entity and their subcontractor? Terrible.</p>

<p>That's sufficient.   David Roberts can give more examples of how bad Springer is in general.  The contract they force you to sign now seems to forbid putting your paper on the arXiv unless you state that the copyright belongs to Springer.  You have to stick lots of crud on the end of your paper saying which author did which percent of the work.  Springer charges <strong>huge amounts of money for its journals</strong> and university libraries are starting to rebel.  Etc.</p>
<p>When <em>Theory and Applications of Categories</em> was founded, a lot of famous category theorists quit being editors at <em>Applied Categorical Structures</em> and became editors at <em>Theory and Applications of Categories</em>.    I support <em>TAC</em> and avoid <em>ACS</em> like the plague.</p>

<p>I see; I have sent a paper to ACS a couple of years ago, and I noticed it got worse since 2015 (when my first paper ever was accepted).</p>
<p>Well, I have several stories of badly handed submissions, one even to TAC... But I will not disclose the details, out of politeness.</p>

<p>The academic editor (and I think the EiC too) at the Springer-published journal was not aware of the publishing agreement I was being asked to sign.  He was under the impression it only forbade me from uploading the Springer-branded pdf.<br>
It goes to show people don't actually read these things too closely, and they change over time.<br>
I filled the editor in and (slightly boldly) suggested the editorial board read and discuss whether they are happy with it. The journal is in fact not owned by Springer, just published by them.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/egregious">Etymology Online</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1530s, "distinguished, eminent, excellent," from Latin <em>egregius</em> "distinguished, excellent, extraordinary," from the phrase <em>ex grege</em> "rising above the flock," from <em>ex</em> "out of" (see <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/ex-">ex-</a>) + <em>grege</em>, ablative of <em>grex</em> "a herd, flock" (from PIE root <a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/*ger-">*ger-</a> "to gather").</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Disapproving sense, now predominant, arose late 16c., originally ironic. It is not in the Latin word, which etymologically means simply "exceptional." Related: <em>Egregiously</em>; <em>egregiousness</em>.</p>
