<p>Given how involved you are, that's some relief. The 'About' section reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Topos Institute Colloquium is an expository talk series highlighting mathematical research in the sciences of connection and integration, with a particular focus on applications of category theory,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>so you can see why I was concerned! Still, more is better, if anyone's aware of anything else?</p>

<p>I don't know about conferences per se (apart from CT and the Oktoberfest, even before Corona there were not that many conferences in the first place).

<p>Well, in the pre-pandemic world, research seminars were generally held in person, so there was not much point in advertising them except to people who could attend physically.  I think even now that all seminars are online, some organizers have chosen not to "invite the whole world" explicitly (even if they do post zoom links or videos on a public web site) to keep a smaller more personal feel.  There's a place for giant seminars that the whole world attends, but there's also a place for more intimate conversations.</p>

<p>It's been almost a year since I had a face-to-face conversation with another category theorist that isn't at the same university as me, and since I apparently wasn't in range of any of these small seminar series while they were happening in person, it's no wonder I'm only hearing about them now.</p>

<p>Well, "the whole world" was of course an exaggeration.  But I was thinking of events like <a href="https://www.uwo.ca/math/faculty/kapulkin/seminars/hottest.html">HoTTEST</a> that are explicitly designed as online events that invite people from everywhere to join, versus seminars that used to be a local in-person thing but just went online because of the pandemic.</p>

<p>This is the one that's not open to the public, right? Kinda sad, the abstracts always look so cool.</p>

<p>It hasn't been announced yet, but a bunch of us at Macquarie are organising a 5-day online category theory symposium for PhD students which will happen in June.  Watch this space!</p>

<p>This may not be commonly known, but there are some good reasons why it isn't open to the public. One of these reasons is that having a closed seminar provides space for PhD and Masters students to share their progress and get feedback without having to worry about the whole world watching in :)</p>

<p>PSSL 106 was postponed indefinitely as of last March.<br>
CT 2020 has become CT 2021.<br>
The MIT Categories Seminar has become the Topos Colloquium, which seems more focussed on applied CT.<br>
Where are the 'pure CT' conferences? Is there any plan to move the above big ones online? I need an outlet for the work I'm finally coming towards finishing, and right now I can't find it! I'm hoping there are events I'm simply unaware of?</p>

<p>Squeezed between ItaCa and the Bohemian Café, I am too busy to organize such a conference, but I must say that an online PSSL106 looks like a doable thing to me. During my stay  at MUNI we have organized PSSL103, it's quite some work, but it is a relatively humble concept and thus doable. </p>

<p>Alright, time for me to get the ball rolling with my advisor. It's more likely to be a follow-up edition of <em>Toposes in Como</em>, but I'll also see what the situation is regarding the planned PSSL in Leeds.</p>

<p>Well, people are not giving zoom IDs and passwords anymore, because some decided that it's a sport to surf for conferences and disrupt them for the heck of it. We had our YouTube streaming of "Women in Logic" taken down--apparently by an anonymous member of the public. (apparently the same happen to POPL2019). The Logic SuperGroup had to resort to two levels of protection as they had too many zoom bombings. I guess, as usual, you have to weigh the worries of security vs the wish to be open to many.</p>
<p>I'm sure you'll be OK with a PSSL. (possibly not exactly how we use to do them, deciding on the Friday night who was going to talk on Sat/Sunday, but on the spirit of work in the process of being done.)</p>
