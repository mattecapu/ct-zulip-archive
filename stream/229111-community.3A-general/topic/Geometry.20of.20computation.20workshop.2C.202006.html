<p>The announcement of this workshop is here, <a href="https://lists.seas.upenn.edu/pipermail/types-list/2005/000857.html">https://lists.seas.upenn.edu/pipermail/types-list/2005/000857.html</a>, however all the links seem dead. I am curious if there is any remaining documentation of the conference (program, list of attendees, etc), or if there is a successor to this conference in spirit/theme. The title (geometry of computation) sounds interesting enough for me to want to dig more into this, and there is at least one file of a presentation/notes that I've come across that seems to originate here (I cannot find it today for some reason)</p>

<p>Hi Sofia, did you try the wayback machine? I found this for example <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20051014035810/http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/geocal06/">https://web.archive.org/web/20051014035810/http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/geocal06/</a></p>

<p>Geocal06 was epic!  As a PhD student in Luminy, I lived in student housing on campus back then, so I was able to attend the whole 5 weeks.  I have great memories of it <span aria-label="slight smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="slight smile">:slight_smile:</span></p>
<p>A couple of years ago I found a CD on a dusty book shelf in my department which might have contained some material (like the abstracts of the talks and such).  I'll see if I can find it again, but I do not guarantee anything because we are currently undergoing a major move and stuff like that is very likely to have been thrown away during clean-up and packing.</p>
<p>In any case, if you don't see what you're looking for on the website found by Valeria, I encourage you to contact <a href="https://www.i2m.univ-amu.fr/perso/laurent.regnier/">Laurent Regnier</a>, my former PhD advisor and one of the main organizers of Geocal06.  He might still have written material from the workshops.</p>
<p>So far there have been two follow-ups, called "Logic and Interactions", organized in the same place and with roughly the same format:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://li2012.univ-mrs.fr/">Logic and Interactions 2012</a></li>
<li><a href="https://conferences.cirm-math.fr/2507.html">Logic and Interactions 2022</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Both very nice events but in my opinion none of them of the caliber of Geocal06.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span> gave a long series of talks on "Diagrammatic Reasoning", he might also have some material from Geocal06 (maybe that same CD I found was given to all participants, I don't remember).</p>

<p>hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276839">@Damiano Mazza</span> nice to hear that you've enjoyed it so much! I did not know about the existence of the CD. it would be nice if one could get the CD digitalized for people who ask for it</p>

<p>I <em>think</em> it was a CD, I have a memory of what looked like a CD case with a group picture of the Geocal06 participants on it.  I am 100% sure about the picture because I remember joking about it with one of my (now former) PhD students, asking him to try and find me in it <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f604" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span>   Whether the CD is real or a fabricated memory, I am less sure, but I'll look for it tomorrow!</p>

<p>I can confirm that the CD (if it ever existed) is gone <span aria-label="pensive" class="emoji emoji-1f614" role="img" title="pensive">:pensive:</span>  All shelves have been emptied, we're supposed to move this Monday!</p>
