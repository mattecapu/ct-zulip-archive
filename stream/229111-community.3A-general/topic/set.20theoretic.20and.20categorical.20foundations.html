<p>Observing that sets are constructed from the bottom up (a set is no more and no less than its elements), one could take a top-down approach, describing basic objects in terms of their parts. One way you could set this up might bring you to Boolean algebras, for instance, but depending on what kind of informal "space" you were basing the formalism on, you might end up with something more intuitionistic or potentially something else altogether.</p>

<p>Well, I don’t personally take it that you can really define first order syntax without a fair bit of set theory, but I note that’s not the most mainstream position. But anyway, ETCS <em>is</em> a set theory; materialism versus structuralism is at least somewhat relevant to this discussion, but the objects of any well pointed topos with the axiom of choice are philosophically an awful lot like Cantorian sets, no?</p>

<p>Yes, that's a common enough position. JP Mayberry explains it as based on a modern misapprehension that it's impossible to have an axiomatic system that's not fully syntactically formalized, which is not in fact something that any mathematician working with axiomatic systems believed between 400BC and about 1920 but has since slipped into the water supply without really ever being explicitly taught. Rather, basic notions like "Any two sets have a union, whose elements are precisely those elements of one or the other set" neither depend on nor benefit from formal syntax, whereas you will find you need to already believe this notion to be able to reasonably discuss addition of natural numbers, let alone concatenation of arbitrary strings in formal syntax.</p>

<p>The second one is probably less philosophically dependent: a string is a function from a total order to its alphabet, and the concatenation of two strings is a function from the sum of those total orders, which is supported on the (disjoint) union of the supports of the starting orders, and so depends on the axiom of set union. </p>
<p>I guess many people would say something like "no, a string is an inscription on a page--or a screen--well, an inscription in principle, I can give some examples and you understand intuitively the general pattern for strings of arbitrary length--and to concatenate two strings you just stick them next to each other--well, of course in general you can't <em>really</em> do that, but you can do it 'in principle'--no, don't ask precisely what principle--" but that's really quite muddled compared to a proper, objective set-theoretic description. </p>
<p>This all boils down to the question of whether saying "you do step 1, then step 2, then go on forever, you know" is actually a satisfactory description of the induction principle to found your mathematics on. It was not for Dedekind and I'm quite convinced that it shouldn't be for anyone.</p>

<p>You can't define first-order syntax formally without some kind of sets.  But they don't have to be ZFC-sets, they could equally well be ETCS-sets.  And that observation applies equally well to the first-order syntax of ZFC as to the first-order syntax of ETCS.  Essentially it's just the observation that logic is a branch of mathematics, even though its object of study is also (an abstraction of) mathematics itself.</p>

<p>“You can’t do X formally without a foundation” is tautologous, as formalising is a game played relative to a foundation. None of what’s been said precludes  an informal first order syntax within which we axiomatise a set theory and then proceed. Indeed, Mayberry is more less or less suggesting we co-opt a fragment of natural language for this very purpose.</p>

<p>I guess I don't see how "informal first order syntax" is a meaningful phrase. You said you think you need a "fair bit of first order syntax" to set up set theory, but now you seem to be saying you can use "informal" syntax and indeed a sub-"syntax" of natural language, which sure sounds a lot like <em>not</em> needing a "fair bit of first order syntax" to me--presumably it goes without saying that you need at least as much syntax as natural language to do much of any intellectual activity!</p>

<p>In particular I don't see how we're really talking about syntax until we're talking about symbols that can be manipulated purely formally/algorithmically, without reference to their meanings, and I don't think that natural language has syntax in this sense, though of course it can be modeled to various extents with various kinds of formal syntax.</p>

<p>As an example, I don’t think the sentence: “two sets are equal if and only if each of the elements of one is an element of the other and vice versa” is meaningful without taking an extreme amount of care with regard to the logical content, far beyond that which is done in daily use of natural language. I would argue that we’re more or less co-opting this expression to denote a first order sentence, helpfully more legibly than purely in symbols, but that we’re not doing mathematics otherwise. In fact, I’d say natural language is offering rather too much syntax and we’re better off doing mathematics with a lot less.</p>

<p>Well, you haven't described any of your own thoughts about syntax, so I understand if I've been tilting at strawmen in reporting what many mathematicians seem to say. I don't really understand your first paragraph. It's not a particularly complicated sentence and people have been using such sentences very precisely, in mathematics, law, and sometimes other parts of life, for an order of magnitude longer than the notion of "first-order sentence" has existed in even inchoate form.</p>

<p>I feel compelled to note until very recently I understood the credibility of syntax to be based in interpretation of physical marks on paper somehow being more credible than other modes of thought, which I didn't like - but after thinking about stuff around it carefully I realized syntax is probably better thought of as an abstraction like any other, with very nice properties. With free monoids being the obvious basic example.</p>
<p>In any case, with respect to syntax, I ended up taking ten steps back because I realized I was still very confused about what exactly I was supposed to be frustrated with. <span aria-label="joy" class="emoji emoji-1f602" role="img" title="joy">:joy:</span></p>
<p>Regarding the primacy of Sets:</p>
<p>I think Roberts brought up ETCS not to underscore that ETCS was the point but to observe "why would someone think defining ETCS was a good idea if defining homsets was a Set motivating roadblock to category theory?"</p>
<p>That the Yoneda lemma is most naturally expressed with a Set theory, I think is probably the most plausible defense of having some Set theory as prior to category theory.</p>
<p>I appreciate you answering my questions the answers are helpful, I'll admit I'm somewhat surprised at how much controversy &amp; tension there seems to be around these ideas.</p>

<p>Yes, I didn't mean to hold ETCS vs ZFC as the solution, but rather point out that the question "what's a category? Isn't there a set, or at least a class, of arrows in between any two objects, and aren't the objects also a class?" is a known one, and has a standard answer ("no").</p>
<p>Regarding syntax, one doesn't need a full-powered set theory to define it, but rather a much weaker fragment. No one needs anything like Z[F[C]] to define syntax. Depending on how hardcore one wants to be with the coding, surely some Turing machine suffices. I don't know if I feel like I need a set theory to define what a Turing machine is (to prove its behaviour is a different matter, I think).</p>
<p>I managed to get an interlibrary loan on Mayberry (it took a while) and then I didn't get a chance to read much before I had to give it back. I appreciated his precise arguments, while simultaneously disagreeing with them quite strongly. I don't think I could recreate my reactions without getting the book again and sitting down and writing things out.</p>

<p>But this is all getting rather off topic, and perhaps the topic needs to split off. The hardcore formalist discussions based on current understanding about "what syntax really is" are, to me, not what dissecting things like how mathematical philosophy of the 18th and 19th century interrelates with dominant worldviews leading up to the present. I like this line from Minhyong Kim:</p>
<p>"the identity politics of the 18th and 19th century generated a complex collection of interests with a network of commitments that led to the story of mathematics being told in a specific way familiar to many of us now. The simplistic idea of proof was but one ingredient in a large ideological edifice, which is quite likely still an obstruction to the spread of mathematical culture and education around the world as well as of peace and understanding." <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202508/noti3124/noti3124.html">https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202508/noti3124/noti3124.html</a></p>

<p>I don't follow how you've said anything about this point. ETCS gives a different way of axiomatizing sets than ZFC, but I don't see how it gives a different way of axiomatizing categories.</p>

<p>Oh, I guess you were referring more to your first message that "the first-order definition of category" doesn't rely on axioms about sets or classes. But basically in the same way as I was saying to Nathan, I really have no idea what people mean when they talk about "the first-order definition of category" without a pre-existing intended notion of model of a first order theory (besides the need to have at least some ability to induct in your background before you can describe what it is you're doing with first-order syntax.) It doesn't seem at all to me that writing down some syntactic manipulations you say you're allowed to do for anything called "categories" at all constitutes defining what a category <em>is</em>.</p>

<p>I wasn't trying to bring up ZFC vs ETCS, but point out that the idea that you need a theory of sets to define hom-sets, to even define a category, has been raised before, in the context of people arguing against non-material set theory foundations, and claiming that categories (and hence categorical foundations like ETCS that posit a category with certain structure/properties) <em>must</em> be logically dependent on set theory <em>for this reason.</em> The people in those discussions weren't at the point of saying "to define raw syntax you need set theory, so clearly to define categories in first-order logic you need set theory". And that wasn't the point you started with.</p>

<p>I guess that's why a lot of my questions have involved trying to "synthetically" specify various physical/geometric systems with certain categories. Because if I can do it, then I can slap on a functor into Set, or whatever, to get a feeling for how it computes.</p>
<p>Just like how I can give a semantics to a simple syntax by defining a functor into Set from a free monoid. Conceiving the free monoid as "physical marks on paper" inspired the above analogy in my thought process.</p>

<p>Interesting! But what is the actual proposal here? Defining a string as "a function from a total order into an alphabet" <em>is</em> a kind of definition of syntax with some internal cohesion, arising from the total order in the domain, and I might argue that this is precisely the amount of cohesion one needs to objectify the space in which (linear) syntax lies. But you seem to be suggesting you want to do this in a way that isn't founded on sets at all, do I have you right? What is that way?</p>

<p>My understanding of the proposal is as follows. To formalise set theory, we need some syntax; and to formalise syntax, we need some set theory. (We could replace set theory with something else, like type theory.) To make any progress (to prevent an infinite regress), at some level, we appeal to informal "intellectual constructs". Then <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="438995">@James Deikun</span>'s argument is that the informal intellectual consturcts of syntax (strings, trees) and of sets/collections are equally basic. So there is no good reason to appeal to one over the other.</p>

<p>This makes me wonder if someone has thought a lot about 'syntax with cohesion', namely syntaxes where there's a <em>space</em> or <em>homotopy type</em> or <em>cohesive homotopy type</em> of well-formed expressions.   I've seen people study examples, like string diagrams thought of as submanifolds of a square or cube, but I haven't seen it studied in generality.   We often think of <em>discreteness</em> as an important way of making syntax robust: i.e. if we draw the letter A a bit differently it means the same thing; its meaning doesn't vary continuously with how we draw it, so the idealized letters form a discrete 26-element set.  But we can imagine trying to take a different attitude.</p>

<p>Maybe I'm an old fuddy-duddy, but I would tend to regard something as "less syntactic" the more cohesive it gets.  (Abstract) syntax for me is an inductively defined structure, and even in an ambient theory that includes higher homotopy types and cohesive types, inductively defined structures generally automatically turn out to be "discrete" unless you put non-discreteness into them by hand as parameters.

<p>The inductivity of the definition of syntax is a key part of why I continue to think you can found syntax on set theory more completely than the other way around. (I wouldn't say I'm talking about "formalizing set theory with a bit of syntax", which doesn't make sense to me; I would rather say you can formalize syntax using informal set theory, and then formalize set theory using formal syntax should you want to do that, so as to study models of the formal theory as mathematical objects in their own right.) </p>
<p>My claim's that you can't make any objective sense of what an inductive definition is--in particular, why an inductive definition should uniquely determine a particular result--without already having the axiom of infinity in your pocket. In particular, reasoning from formalizations of set theory for the sake of argument, in the <em>absence</em> of the axiom of infinity there can be many different proper classes which the assertion of that axiom would make into isomorphic sets of "natural numbers", so there's no longer any reason to believe that "a string is what you get from starting with a letter, concatenating a letter to any string, and going on forever" is at all well-defined. So you need to know what the natural numbers are to give a precise definition of a string, but you don't need to know what a string is to give a precise definition of (say, the von Neumann) natural numbers.</p>

<p>This makes me wonder if someone has thought a lot about 'syntax with cohesion', namely syntaxes where there's a <em>space</em> or <em>homotopy type</em> or <em>cohesive homotopy type</em> of well-formed expressions.   I've seen people study examples, like string diagrams thought of as submanifolds of a square or cube, but I haven't seen it studied in generality.   We often think of <em>discreteness</em> as an important way of making syntax robust: i.e. if we draw the letter A a bit differently it means the same thing; its meaning doesn't vary continuously with how we draw it, so the idealized letters form a discrete 26-element set.  But we can imagine trying to take a different attitude.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the case of string diagrams, it's actually the fact that things are (mostly) continuous that makes them robust, which I think shows there's something to the notion.  In fact, to the extent that things are "discrete" in string diagrams, the discreteness arises out of the continuous nature of the interpretation of the syntax because continuous maps <em>into</em> a discrete semantics must be locally constant.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="609515">@Kevin Carlson</span> What do you think about inductive definitions in Martin-Lof type theory?  For instance, here's an inductive definition in Rocq syntax of the set of strings, which doesn't refer explicitly to the natural numbers:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>Inductive string : Type :=
| nil : string
| cons : letter -&gt; string -&gt; string.
</code></pre></div>
<p>This definition and its resulting induction principle uniquely characterize the set of strings (inside MLTT).  Would you say that this is "not objective"?  Or "not precise"?  Or that when making it we "already know what the natural numbers are" in some implicit sense?</p>

<p>My claim's that you can't make any objective sense of what an inductive definition is--in particular, why an inductive definition should uniquely determine a particular result--without already having the axiom of infinity in your pocket. In particular, reasoning from formalizations of set theory for the sake of argument, in the <em>absence</em> of the axiom of infinity there can be many different proper classes which the assertion of that axiom would make into isomorphic sets of "natural numbers", so there's no longer any reason to believe that "a string is what you get from starting with a letter, concatenating a letter to any string, and going on forever" is at all well-defined. So you need to know what the natural numbers are to give a precise definition of a string, but you don't need to know what a string is to give a precise definition of (say, the von Neumann) natural numbers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How can you "have the axiom of infinity in your pocket" without being able to work with (informal) syntax?  You can't state it without syntax, so you can only have it as an intuition.  And a string doesn't need to be defined to be used informally any more than a set does, so you don't need an inductive definition of strings (or trees), only induction principles for them, for which you can appeal directly to an intuition about which kinds of properties are local in nature.</p>
<p>It's not like you get every induction principle you want for finitely-describable mathematical constructs from the axiom of infinity anyway, you need the axiom of replacement and large cardinal axioms, or else you need large countable ordinal axioms.  And the idea that these strong induction principles "should be" true is the main supporting column of set theorists' attempts to convince mainstream mathematicians (and even some of each other) that these "large number" axioms should be true of "the" mathematical sets, once you unwind the way it's couched in stuff like Ramsey theory.  (If you <em>don't</em> unwind it, then the main supporting column is the intuition that strong finitary reflection principles "should be" true of cohesive structures, which is just as far from really being based in intuitions about sets!)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276777">@Mike Shulman</span> I’d accept the first and the last one—it’s clear enough that this definition specifies something that’s unique if it exists, but I guess you just have to assert that it exists. Of course you’ll need some assumption to get anything infinite to exist, but it feels like it carves the situation more finely to construct some candidate class of natural numbers and then decide whether to assume that one of them forms a genuine set, then if so prove the theorem that your result is unique.</p>

<p>This definition (Dedekind finiteness) only leads to a satisfactory definition of string classically, and MLTT is often used for constructive or intuitionistic reasoning.</p>

<p>In fact, the equivalence of finiteness to Dedekind finiteness requires not only classical logic but some form of the axiom of choice.</p>
<p>It's also possible to define <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/finite+set#section_Finiteness_without_infinity">finite sets</a> directly without the axiom of infinity, so your definition doesn't need the natural numbers in that sense.  However, there are a proper class of finite sets, so I'm not sure how "a string is a function from a finite total order to the alphabet" leads to a definition of a <em>set</em> of strings.</p>

<p>There's an immense variety of kinds of inductive definition that are used all throughout mathematics, particularly when formulating it inside of type theory.  Coproducts, more general colimits, free monoids, free groups and other algebraic structures, factorization systems, localizations, and so on, are all instances of inductive definitions.  And when these constructions are performed in a background theory that is cohesive or homotopical, the cohesion or homotopy of the parameters carries through to them.</p>
<p>In addition, introductory texts on <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/homotopy%20type%20theory">[[homotopy type theory]]</a>, such as the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/HoTT%20Book">[[HoTT Book]]</a> or Rijke's <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Introduction%20to%20homotopy%20type%20theory">[[Introduction to homotopy type theory]]</a>, will generally discuss <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/higher%20inductive%20types">[[higher inductive types]]</a>, a kind of inductive definition that gets higher homotopy "put in by hand" rather than inherited from the parameters.  And my <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07584">single paper</a> on cohesive homotopy type theory discusses one example of a "cohesive higher inductive type", the shape modality, which "puts in cohesion by hand" -- although in that specific instance it is sort of the opposite in that the parameter may starts out nontrivially cohesive but the shape puts in new cohesion to kill off the old cohesion and ends up being cohesively discrete (though perhaps nontrivially homotopical).</p>

<p>Right.  It was a deliberately odd question because the usual answer is "no, if the meaning varies continuously as a function of your handwriting that's not math - that's something else."  </p>

<p>I agree with all this.   But sometimes mathematicians like to take crazy leaps, like imagine that -1 has a square root, before formalizing the complex numbers, or - closer to what I'm wondering about now - study '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitary_logic">infinitary logic</a>': logic with infinitely long sentences.   (Link for those who haven't looked into this yet.)</p>
<p>These weird things produce feelings of "well, you're just <em>pretending</em> to do math that way" - the feeling that made people call 'em 'imaginary' numbers, or  say "you're not really <em>using</em> infinitary logic, you're using ordinary logic to reason about an imaginary world of infinitary logic".   </p>
<p>But sidestepping that sort of debate, I'm wondering if someone has tried doing (or pretending to do) non-discrete logic, with non-discrete syntax.   Homotopy type theory could be seen as a move in that direction, generalizing sets to homotopy types, but I agree with you that it doesn't really make that leap, which would be a more crazy sort of leap.</p>

<p>You're right - good point.  The fact that string diagrams can be continuously varied is what makes a lot of mathematicians very nervous when first encountering them.   But we reassure these mathematicians by proving that the <em>meaning</em> of a string diagram varies continuously but also discretely, and is thus locally constant.   </p>

<p>This argument only makes sense if you assume ahead of time that an inductive definition is supposed to specify a set. The inductive definition of strings (in some alphabet) tells me how to build strings, and I can prove that something is a string by exhibiting a construction according to the rules set out in the induction principle. I don't need to believe in a unique, coherent collection of all strings to recognize any particular instance of a string, or argue about properties of strings that follow from the inductive definition, let alone believe that such a collection would satisfy any of the axioms (formal or informal) required of a set.</p>

<p>It goes back at least to <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hilbert-program/">Hilbert's program</a>.   All the following is about steps 1 and 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whereas the operating with abstract concepts was considered “inadequate and uncertain,” [Hilbert said that] there is a realm of</p>
<blockquote>
<p>extra-logical discrete objects, which exist intuitively as immediate experience before all thought. If logical inference is to be certain, then these objects must be capable of being completely surveyed in all their parts, and their presentation, their difference, their succession (like the objects themselves) must exist for us immediately, intuitively, as something which cannot be reduced to something else. (<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hilbert-program/#Hilbert:22a">Hilbert 1922b</a>, 202; the passage is repeated almost verbatim in <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hilbert-program/#Hilbert:26">Hilbert 1926</a>, 376, <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hilbert-program/#Hilbert:28">Hilbert 1928</a>, 464, and <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hilbert-program/#Hilbert:31b">Hilbert 1931b</a>, 267)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These objects were, for Hilbert, <em>signs</em>. The domain of contentual number theory consists in the finitary numerals, i.e., sequences of strokes. These have no meaning, i.e., they do not stand for abstract objects, but they can be operated on (e.g., concatenated) and compared. Knowledge of their properties and relations is intuitive and unmediated by logical inference. Contentual number theory developed this way is secure, according to Hilbert: no contradictions can arise simply because there is no logical structure in the propositions of contentual number theory.</p>
<p>The intuitive-contentual operations with signs forms the basis of Hilbert’s metamathematics. Just as contentual number theory operates with sequences of strokes, so metamathematics operates with sequences of symbols (formulas, proofs). Formulas and proofs can be syntactically manipulated, and the properties and relationships of formulas and proofs are similarly based in a logic-free intuitive capacity which guarantees certainty of knowledge about formulas and proofs arrived at by such syntactic operations. Mathematics itself, however, operates with abstract concepts, e.g., quantifiers, sets, functions, and uses logical inference based on principles such as mathematical induction or the principle of the excluded middle. These “concept-formations” and modes of reasoning had been criticized by Brouwer and others on grounds that they presuppose infinite totalities as given, or that they involve impredicative definitions (which were considered by the critics as viciously circular). Hilbert’s aim was to justify their use. To this end, he pointed out that they can be formalized in axiomatic systems (such as that of <em>Principia</em> or those developed by Hilbert himself), and mathematical propositions and proofs thus turn into formulas and derivations from axioms according to strictly circumscribed rules of derivation. Mathematics, so Hilbert said, “becomes an inventory of provable formulas.”</p>

<p>Of course this isn't handwriting, but I've wondered if drawings like the above could become proofs in a more modern sense.</p>
<p>I've sort of decided this wasn't something I personally could move forward, because an artist with strong visual accuracy once told me they didn't believe people could accurately draw sin curves by hand. Which means you need machines to draw those curves, and what machines do that best? Programs grounded in some constructive foundation like <a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@MartinEscardo/115226876080558927">Android's calculator</a></p>
<p>The math foundations and computer science folks really punch above their "discrete" weight class.</p>
<p>That said, I find your musings about math tied to handwriting encouraging to my interest in this stuff. When I first learned Hilbert wanted "intuitively recognized signs, or sequences of strokes" as an isolated premathematical layer, it made me wonder if I was missing the point.</p>
<p>It's just so easy to imagine obstructions. For example, you can nest function calls and variables for days. Adding continuously meaningful syntax seems like it'd break this. Sort of like how adding continuous voltages to discrete circuits makes them less reliable, but "no more expressive".</p>

<p>OK, so, I could just about see how you can sleep at night with this, but it seems like a motte to me--I'm dubious that type theorists really are thinking, when they defining the type of strings, "well, who knows what all the strings are, really," let alone "well, who knows what all the loops in the circle are, really". If so, then again, that's really interesting! But I think it's at least as radical a shift from mainstream 20th-century foundations as denying the axiom of infinity in set-theoretic foundations.</p>

<p>Let me spell out my idea of a set-theoretic foundation in a bit more detail. There are some things called sets, such as the set of items on my desk right now.  Some things, presumably, are not sets; I don't think my mug is a set, personally. For any two things you give me, I can definitely affirm there is a set whose two elements are those two things. If you give me a set whose elements are all sets, I can definitely affirm there's a set whose elements are all the elements of the first set. Two sets are the same if they have all the same elements; there's no notion of order and it doesn't matter how the elements are related to each other. For any two things, there's an <em>ordered</em> pair of those things, which you know how to define in terms of sets from college, so you don't need to imagine some new primitive notion of order. This leads to cartesian products and functions and all that in the usual way. </p>
<p>This is obviously only the very beginning, but you can go on in this way as long as you want, up to and including all of mathematics. There is at <em>no</em> point any need whatsoever to define a formal first-order theory such as ZF to "found" your mathematics on, and it seems to me to be a straightforward confusion that anyone thinks there's any relationship between formal theories and foundations. Whatever is required for formal theories, they are definitely mathematical objects, and it's <em>prima facie</em> absurd to try to found your mathematics on a mathematical object!</p>

<p>(Probably the likeliest objection to the last point is to deny that mathematics <em>needs</em> foundations, which is a reputable position though I disagree; I was responding to the proposed "foundational ladder", which seems to me not to be a reputable position at all.)</p>

<p>As for this, my main response is that this is simply not how mathematics is in fact founded. Only a miniscule percentage of all mathematics has been "formalized," and it would beg the question to assume that, once a proof has been formalized in a computer, that's somehow a faithful representation of the mathematics itself. If this were an accurate representation of how mathematics is founded, mathematics would really be a formal game of symbol-pushing, and very, very few people would care about it at all.</p>

<p>I really resonate with how modern logicians frame foundations, like the way Carlson just did, in part because it seems to me to potentially allow for quite a bit of open mindedness about how mathematics could be done. Is that true? </p>
<p>Shulman recommended the intro to "Mathematical Logic A course with exercises" by Cori and Lascar, and I really liked it. Would this be a good book to work through, or are there better intros to foundations from a modern or cs point of view?</p>
<p>I've been sort of assuming I'd absorb foundational knowledge via HoTT by osmosis, but now I'm not sure that's the most efficient approach.</p>

<p>It may be helpful to remind everyone that "foundations" is used in different ways by different people.  Sometimes it simply means a theory into which all of mathematics can be encoded, i.e. a theory that is "mathematics-complete".  A formal theory can be "foundational" in this sense without implying any formalist philosophy regarding "what mathematics is really about".  Other times a "foundation" is asked to supply some philosophical "justification" or "explanation" for mathematics.  If we're going to disagree about what is foundational, first we have to agree on what we mean by "foundational".</p>

<p>Yeah, maybe that’s what people are thinking of when they describe foundations by starting with some formal syntax—that first perspective on foundations as providing a formal theory in which all others can be encoded. I’m thinking of the second one, though I wouldn’t phrase it quite that way, mores like “foundations is the practice of finding collections of non-mathematical facts sufficient, once agreed on, to let mathematicians get started doing mathematics.” This second sense is one that probably a lot of people say they don’t think is necessary at all.</p>

<p>About Hilbert: he was certainly proven wrong about the fact that the foundational ladder could rest on provably consistent grounds, but the foundational ladder itself is still, as far as I understand, the basis of contemporary foundations (in the sense of "writing mathematics in a formal system").  People working in set theory still use systems built out of strings of symbols, accepting that those strings of symbols do not need any prior formal system to be defined on.  I guess that's the "non-mathematical" part of foundations that you (Kevin) are attached to.  I prefer to call it "primitive", in the sense of agreed upon without formal justification, but it's the same idea.</p>

<p>In fact, strictly speaking it is not even true that the foundational ladder does not rest on provably consistent grounds.  It's just that we need a bigger leap of faith than the one Hilbert was believing to be necessary.  In fact, even if Hilbert's program had succeeded (i.e., no Gödel's incompleteness), we would still have needed <em>some</em> faith, namely the faith in the "kernel" system which would have proved the consistency of, say, ZF.  It turns out that, instead, we must have faith in ZF itself, or in even bigger systems that can prove the consistency of ZF.  I guess people got used to it, and it doesn't seem such a big leap of faith to us now!</p>

<p>You seem to be just saying the same thing I'm saying now.

<p>I'm finding the analogy to musical notation rather mysterious and perhaps question-begging in the same sense as the claim that mathematics "may be written down" in a formal system.</p>
<p>Anyway, perhaps more interesting is this question of what foundations is for. It's not at all the case historically that what Cantor, Dedekind, and their successors thought they had done in founding mathematics on set theory is the discovery that you can encode many first-order theories into the first-order theory called ZFC. For my part, it would never really have occurred to me to think of calling "formalized mathematics" "foundations." They seem like almost entirely unrelated activities to me, except insofar as Hilbert's program did actually try, unsuccessfully, to give a genuine foundation on a formal system, setting mathematics free of any reason to appeal to extra-mathematical realities. That seems to me to have been a terrible goal, incidentally, which brings us back a bit to the thread this originally spun out of!</p>

<p>As I said, my understanding of these things is shaky, but I think that ZF <em>can</em> be written down so that it "pre-exists" first-order logic.  The thing is that it looks exactly like a first-order theory, so we might think we need the whole apparatus of first-order logic (including model theory), but we don't.</p>

<p>That's the thing: I don't think formulas need to be "defined" in the sense you appear to be thinking!  For me, a formula is an object that can be agreed upon much more easily than a freely written English sentence.</p>

<p>I don’t see how two people are really doing anything when they agree on a formula like the one I wrote other than translating it in their heads to a mental representation of the sentence “for any two things there’s a set whose elements are exactly those two things”, which is so obviously easier to agree on that I’m sure I’m entirely missing your point.</p>

<p>I think we both agree on this: we must agree on some objects that we both consider to be "self evident".   You consider "sets", described in plain English, to be such objects.  I (and, I think, all logicians) take formulas.</p>

<p>Of course you need to know that classes and sets are different to avoid paradoxes, but it’s not formulas that fixed that problem, but understanding the concept of class better. Frege invented both formal logic and inconsistent foundations!</p>

<p>Sorry, I had to leave for a moment (and I'll have to go soon, it's late here).</p>
<p>About an example of ambiguity : you already gave one above.  When you write "every two sets can be paired", I don't even know what you mean.  What does "pairing" mean?  How do you "pair" sets?  Sure, you add more words, you give a more accurate description.  But how do you know I won't misinterpret?  A formula cannot be misinterpreted.</p>
<p>About the usefulness of formulas: remember that the key point is formalizing proofs.  Like formulas, these are certain labelled trees (a primitive concept that needs no pre-existing formal system).  Formulas allow you to do this very nicely: introduction of connectives, elimination of connectives, etc.  Defining formal proofs using plain English sentences instead of formulas seems impossible to me.</p>
<p>Now I have the feeling that you are going to question the usefulness of formal proofs, because you've been doing fine all your life writing proofs in plain English.  So have I!  But try, without formal proofs, to prove that a certain statement written in plain English is unprovable in your system of axioms written in plain English with a proof written completely freely in plain English.  Good luck!</p>

<p>Formal proofs are, of course, great and quite necessary if you want to prove something about proofs! You need to give a definition of any object you're going to try to prove something about. And I agree that you need formal syntax for formal proofs. I haven't said anything that was intended to disagree with any of that. I just think the obvious definition of a <em>formal</em> proofs is in terms of some inductively defined set, and your induction principle is most reasonably founded on pre-formal understandings about sets. But we're not in disagreement about anything about formal proofs. I just don't see what formalization of proofs has to do with foundations, and didn't mean to be talking about it. </p>
<p>I very much disagree that a formula <em>cannot</em> be misinterpreted; indeed formulas have no interpretation, in their own right, and of course it's possible to apply some given interpretation incorrectly, and such errors comprise a substantial difficulty in mathematical education during the brief period that relies a lot on formulas. Dually I don't think it's possible in any <em>pragmatically</em> significant sense to misinterpret the sentence “for any two things there’s a set whose elements are exactly those two things”.</p>

<p>Certainly, mathematics is not whatsoever "an inventory of provable formulas", and nobody thinks it is; if you try to insist that number theory is about numerals, that's where you inevitably end up if you're as serious a thinker as Hilbert was. If you, as I think category theorists usually do, realize that a statement about "numerals" can be interpreted as a general theorem about finite sets, then you don't seem to end up saying anything quite so silly!</p>

<p>I think I agree that set-theoretic foundations explain arithmetic's connectedness to the real world much better than they explain that of geometry. Analysis is, perhaps, some intermediate case.

<p>I think James was saying that founding something like Euclidean geometry on set theory, whether in a synthetic or an analytic presentation, doesn't seem to clarify how it is that we find many physical objects approximately obeying the theorems of Euclidean geometry, in contrast with the situation where, if we found natural number arithmetic on finite set manipulations by essentially categorifying the arithmetic operations, then it's almost tautological why theorems of arithmetic reflect the behavior of real-world objects.</p>

<p>OK, I see. It's fun to see somebody defending abstract ideal objects explicitly, even if it seems to me that, historically, much of the point of giving set-theoretic definitions of mathematical objects was to avoid abstract ideals. I guess you see those set-theoretic definitions as arbitrary encodings of the "real" abstract objects?

<p>I guess that depends on how I end up deciding to feel about numerical identity of objects, which I haven't exactly decided on yet.  The way I'm leaning, though, is that fundamentally the only "the" is the categorist's "the" and other kinds of "the" are context-dependent.</p>

<p>But, you might say, "none of this shakes my belief that 2 and 2 are 4." You are quite right, except in marginal cases -- and it is only in marginal cases that you are doubtful whether a certain animal is a dog or a certain length is less than a meter. Two must be two of something, and the proposition "2 and 2 are 4" is useless unless it can be applied. Two dogs and two dogs are certainly four dogs, but cases arise in which you are doubtful whether two of them are dogs. "Well, at any rate there are four animals," you may say. But there are microorganisms concerning which it is doubtful whether they are animals or plants. "Well, then living organisms," you say. But there are things of which it is doubtful whether they are living organisms or not. You will be driven into saying: "Two entities and two entities are four entities."

<p>Let me spell out my idea of a set-theoretic foundation in a bit more detail. There are some things called sets, such as the set of items on my desk right now.  Some things, presumably, are not sets; I don't think my mug is a set, personally. For any two things you give me, I can definitely affirm there is a set whose two elements are those two things. If you give me a set whose elements are all sets, I can definitely affirm there's a set whose elements are all the elements of the first set. Two sets are the same if they have all the same elements; there's no notion of order and it doesn't matter how the elements are related to each other. For any two things, there's an <em>ordered</em> pair of those things, which you know how to define in terms of sets from college, so you don't need to imagine some new primitive notion of order. This leads to cartesian products and functions and all that in the usual way. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was thinking that one could approach concrete syntax—actual marks or signs—in the same way: there are some things called strings, made of ordered symbols, and for any two strings given to be in order, I can definitely affirm there's a string whose symbols are those that .... etc.</p>
<p>If you want, you can call the collection of glyphs "sets" of symbols and the glyphs the elements. This is of course taking a rather formalist approach to mathematics. But I don't have to say that the strings are made of the usual symbols of first-order logic. They can be the everyday usual strings of symbols working mathematicians use.</p>

<p>I used to joke, when I was a lecturer, that I was in the business of rewiring student's brains. Ultimately the mathematics they learn (to whatever level of completeness) is neural patterns in their brain that can be said to correspond to other patterns in other brains. This can be communicated by a shared language. Kevin Buzzard liked to highlight the process of transmission of mathematics in talks a few years back, via the path brain &gt; tex &gt; pdf on writer's machine &gt; pdf on reader's machine &gt; brain (roughly; his point was that one could use Lean and get better detail recorded and less scope for errors)</p>

<p>When I originally asked "Why not start with Category theory as your foundation" I think I had in mind formal systems for encoding mathematics that looked a lot like category theory, not unlike tools like CatColab.</p>
<p>I was wondering "Why not use a math proof assistant that tracked how much energy calculations used" or however you would try to model how mathematical arguments might relate to a broader ecology. And I probably left it too implicit how I imagined this might relate to category theory. I see a lot of Baez's work as ecologically inspired in a manner that seems hard to model in a straightforward way with lambda calculus or ZFC inspired systems, for example.</p>
<p>I don't see this as unrelated to how one might argue garbage collectors actually obscure information about how the cost of various data are related, as opposed to linear type systems.</p>
<p>Now, it isn't actually clear to me that foundations in the "how do we justify math" sense are actually unrelated to this. I agree that my basic conclusions about sets will agree with other mathematicians, and that I can be certain about this agreement, even if I don't know why. I interpreted the original article inspiring the thread as trying to ask something like "is this notion of a set we readily agree on - bad for the environment? If so, is it possible to replace it with something else we can be certain about that isn't?"</p>
<p>Is it "foundational" to ask "Can we think of our primitive notion of set as having a cost associated to its size?" For example? Or am I mixing levels?</p>
<p>The way I'm thinking about this is a finitest might put up front an infinite price for infinite sets, "they don't like them". Or exact representations of numbers worked out as far as you could want, have associated asymptotic costs that we would think of as "baked in".</p>
<p>But maybe this framing is confused or not really about "justifying math" foundations?</p>

<p>I think it’s essentially true that you can do that kind of thing, but that there are much bigger difficulties in doing so with strings than with sets. You will have to immediately define a much more abstruse notion of equivalence of strings than the simple notion for sets, for instance, if you want to understand when people are writing essentially the same thing. You will have questions about whether a string can break off the end of a page, or off the end of a universe, or whether it can be represented via electrical signals, and all kinds of pretty tricky stuff. This is all perfectly resolvable but it seems clear to me that what the resolution actually <em>is</em> is to say “a string in an alphabet is a function from a finite total order to that alphabet.” Why would you want your mathematical definition to start out relying on details of physics when you could have the latter definition instead?</p>

<p>The Russell quote is cute but I don’t see why I should have to define entities to say “whenever you have two things you accept as entities and two other such things, putting them together will get 4.” The idea is that mathematicians might need to agree about sets to get math off the ground, not that they need to agree about general metaphysics, which is clearly hopeless.</p>

<p>Possibly we should.  If you push a little, though, a "definite entity" like "the Eiffel Tower" is really about as fraught as a "symbol" like "A" though.  We know perfectly well how to make strings by arranging "symbols" along a "line", though "symbol" and "line" are themselves complex, nebulous concepts, similarly to how we know how to make sets by aggregating "entities" though "entity" is itself a complex, nebulous concept.</p>

<p>The physical world is probably even more mysterious than the mathematical world.   It keeps getting more removed from everyday common sense the more we learn about it, and there's no sign that we're almost done.    So the idea that math is fundamentally about the physical world is pretty terrifying to me.

<p>Mathematical fact isn’t dependent on the specific nature of the physical universe we happen to be in. I think that claim would find almost universal acceptance. If it were, it’d just be physics.</p>
<p>As James says, if you’re going to bother with foundations of math, you want to find the least controversial possible foundations that’ll let you get on with it. Many things about physics are controversial and even unknown; deep thinking about metaphysics is even worse. You want to allow people to bring their own understanding of physics and metaphysics as much as possible and end up doing the same math. It turns out, I think, that math is almost perfectly parametric in your metaphysics and doesn’t depend on physics in any way at all.</p>

<p>I'm maybe getting indirectly convinced, that practically speaking, if you found an ecologically relevant formal theory, that was really good at solving problems. Then folks would then be motivated to sort out foundational issues with it, if they seemed relevant.</p>
<p>But then again, this seems like an overly pessimistic view on my part. Because I'm understanding Bishop's constructive mathematics, for example, to be a result of carefully thinking about foundational issues with the continuum. And it has practical consequences on how people do math.</p>

<p>I think mathematics would at least be thought about very differently in a universe where you could write infinitely long strings.  First order logic as we know it and finite/recursive axiomatizations would be much less important than they are to mathematicians in our universe, and a theory like ZFC would probably be considered a super weak foundation.</p>

<p>I like that sci-fi idea.  I decided to popularize it on Mathstodon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's Sunday, time for idle speculations:</p>
<p>If spacetime had far more points than it does in our unvierse, then the way we do logic might be very different.   </p>
<p>In our universe, most logicians act like we can write down infinitely many different strings of symbols.   But this is just the smallest infinity, called ℵ₀.   There are a lot more real numbers, namely 2 to the ℵ₀.   This larger infinity sets the limits on how many points there are in space.   But since there's a limitation to the accuracy of our measurements, we can only write down ℵ₀ different symbol strings.   In <em>our</em> universe.</p>
<p>There are much larger infinities, though.  Logicians have thought about logic with infinitely long statements - even for one of these much larger infinities.  It's called 'infinitary logic'.   We can't really <em>use</em> infinitary logic, but we can prove theorems about what it would be like.</p>
<p>I don't know if physicists have imagined laws of physics that would give infinitely bigger universes, whose inhabitants could actually use infinitary logic.   For example, imagine a universe whose inhabitants use an alphabet with 2 to the ℵ₀ different symbols - and can actually recognize the difference between them!   They could talk about vastly more complex things than we can.   Their math would be much deeper.  ℵ₀ would seem small to them.</p>
<p>I think someone should give it a try, just for fun.  It could at least make for a good science fiction story.</p>
<p>Here's an easy intro to infinitary logic:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitary_logic">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitary_logic</a></p>
<p>Here's a deeper intro:</p>
<p><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-infinitary/">https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-infinitary/</a></p>
<p>I spend a lot of time talking math on the Category Theory Community Server.   When I raised the possibility of a physical universe that let us a larger infinity of symbols in our math, James Deikun wrote</p>
<p>"I think mathematics would at least be thought about very differently in a universe where you could write infinitely long strings.  First order logic as we know it and finite/recursive axiomatizations would be much less important than they are to mathematicians in our universe, and a theory like ZFC would probably be considered a super weak foundation."</p>
<p>Ordinary first-order logic is 'compact'.  This means that if you have a theory in first-order logic with infinitely many axioms, and every finite subset of these axioms has a model, then the whole set of axioms has a model.   This is extremely important in logic, and it connects logic to topology:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compactness_theorem">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compactness_theorem</a></p>
<p>Infinitary logics are usually not compact.   But there's a generalization of compactness that's pretty interesting.</p>
<p>If you give me a cardinal κ, we can talk about a logic that allows infinitely many variable names, infinitely long conjunctions, and formulae with infinitely many alternating quantifiers ∀∃∀ ... - but only if these infinities are less than κ.   This logic is called L(κ,κ).</p>
<p>Then we say κ is 'strongly compact' if whenver you have a theory in this logic with infinitely many axioms, and every subset of axioms with cardinality &lt; κ has a model, the whole theory has a model.</p>
<p>Logicians would like to live in a universe where people used the logic L(κ,κ) for a strongly compact cardinal κ.  </p>
<p>But it turns out strongly compact cardinals bigger than <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="normal">ℵ</mi><mn>0</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\aleph_0</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8444em;vertical-align:-0.15em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord">ℵ</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.3011em;"><span style="top:-2.55em;margin-left:0em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">0</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.15em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> have to be really, really, really, really, really large.  </p>

<p>I think James was saying that founding something like Euclidean geometry on set theory, whether in a synthetic or an analytic presentation, doesn't seem to clarify how it is that we find many physical objects approximately obeying the theorems of Euclidean geometry, in contrast with the situation where, if we found natural number arithmetic on finite set manipulations by essentially categorifying the arithmetic operations, then it's almost tautological why theorems of arithmetic reflect the behavior of real-world objects.</p>

<p>It just seems to me very deeply baked in to the nature of type theory that you're never saying "what a type really is"; you're just saying various things you can do with types and various things you can do with their terms and everybody agrees that that's sufficient to accomplish their common mathematical/computational goals. I don't see how type theory has any opinion about whether it's more correct to say "we all agree on what the type of natural numbers is" or "we all agree on what the functional properties of the type of natural numbers is, and beyond that we're agnostic."</p>

<p>I suppose you might say that type theory says that types that have all the same functional properties are (by the definition of "same") the same, but I'm not really convinced it necessarily does do that. Even univalent type theories, of course, have (some of) their semantics in places where univalent equality and literal equality diverge, and it seems that it's perfectly valid for me to do type theory while imagining that <em>what I'm talking about</em> is some such model.</p>

<p>Yes, that makes sense. I think I’m cavilling with the sense in which the first definition defines “one specific type.” It doesn’t seem that type theory cares what I think this thing ‘zero’ in Nat is: whether it’s a string, or a memory address, or the empty set, or whatever. Probably actually type theory would get mad at me for trying to ask the question, because of course ‘zero’ is by definition a natural number! It just cares that Nat is something that has some term which we’re willing to call ‘zero’, etc. At the next level up, it doesn’t seem to me that type theory attempts to define what, exactly a type is. It just tells you which ones you have and what you’re allowed to do with them. Insofar as I can interpret type theory into Set, it seems a type <em>could</em> be a set for me, but of course it need not be, and maybe it need not be anything sharply defined at all?</p>

<p>That's one way to look at it.  But I don't think that's the type-theoretic way to look at it.  I would say that type theory <em>does</em> care what you think the thing 'zero' is, and in fact it tells you the answer: 'zero' is by definition a natural number.</p>
<p>This is also the answer to your "next level up" question: A type is, by definition, the kind of thing that can be the answer to a question "what kind of thing is X?".  So ℕ is a type, and it is the answer to the question "what kind of thing is 'zero'?".</p>

<p>And if by "what this thing is" you mean what <em>specifically</em> rather than what <em>kind</em> of thing, then the answer is even simpler: 'zero' is 'zero'.  It doesn't have to be anything else.  The definition of the type ℕ introduces its elements as well, and they are what they are.  It's not that we don't <em>care</em> whether 'zero' is a string or a memory address; it's that it <em>isn't</em> any of them.  It's itself.</p>

<p>I mean, "zero" as a number is not a fact if you go back far enough in time (and people still quibble over whether it should be a natural number).

What formal systems do is ensure rigour, not completeness of specification of the objects they talk about.</p>

<p>So what kinds of question are sensible to ask of Raskolnikov? In case it helps, I mean to ask if the fictional character Raskolnikov has a fictional mole on his fictional left leg. Call this an "object-level" question. I wouldn't want to say that we can only ask "meta-level" questions like: "in the real world, does Dostoevsky write in Crime and Punishment that Raskolnikov has a mole on his left leg?"</p>
<p>I agree that there's something iffy about asking whether you're the protagonist. But I think what I find iffy is a different: just that the question is not well-formed. Someone can be the protagonist of a story. So if you tell me what story you mean, we should be able to say (or sensibly debate) whether you're the protagonist.</p>

<p>This particular vein of question reminds me I don't like the word "abstract". One reason I got excited about category theory was that it gave me terminology beyond "more abstract".</p>
<p>Certain "Abstract data types" become objects uniquely specified by universal properties. Or certain algorithms between containers "abstracted over the type of their data" are really natural transformations.</p>
<p>When thinking about Raskolnikov, maybe it's possible to write something like "Raskolnikov : FictionalCharacter". We always have access to the question "isProtagonist : FictionalCharacter → Bool" but not "hasMole : FictionalCharacter → Bool" because that's not well defined across all stories.

<p>So what kinds of question are sensible to ask of Raskolnikov? In case it helps, I mean to ask if the fictional character Raskolnikov has a fictional mole on his fictional left leg.

</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure this is any different than the question "Did George Washington have a mole on his left leg?" Like very many questions in our world, the answer might be yes or no, but it also might be "it's impossible for us to know this", if nobody ever happened to write down a sufficiently detailed description of Washington's left leg while it existed. I think you can ask about any question about Raskolnikov you might ask about a real person; for questions about psychology, you will generally be able to get more definitive answers than you would about most real people, while for concrete questions you'll find it easier to answer most of them for a person now living who you have direct access to, whereas the comparison to historical figures or those far away from you will be a toss-up depending on how much documentation you have of this other.</p>

<p>OK, so your intuition is what, exactly, that concrete things have a maximal possible set of questions that have determinate answers, or something like that? But I can just ask whether George Washington would have made himself king had he not chopped down the cherry tree and immediately get indeterminate questions about him as well, and it seems like this one's indeterminate in much the same way as a question about details of Raskolnikov's appearance--we could have had the answer had the, er, author made different decisions, but as it turns out it's not present in the text.</p>

<p>I think it works like this: you can ask various questions about Raskolnikov, but if Dostoevsky's <em>Crime and Punishment</em> doesn't answer that question I'll say "sorry, that's not in the book".  So yeah, if Dostoevsky said whether or not Raskolnikov had a mole on his left leg I could answer that question.  But he didn't.</p>
<p>So it's not exactly that the question is ill-formed in some way that's easily determined from the syntax or the 'type' of Raskolnikov, it's just that the question might be unanswerable because it relies on a mistaken assumption.  I imagine linguists and logicians have thought about this kind of thing, which is not merely about fictional characters: it applies to entities of many kinds.  </p>
<p>For example you're allowed to ask me "what is your uncle's oldest daughter's name?" and I'll say "Joan", and you're allowed to ask me to say "what is your uncle's oldest son's name?" and I'll say "sorry, he had no sons".</p>

<p>By the way, a really spooky feature of quantum mechanics is that quantum uncertainty applies not only to the future but to some past events.  It's possible that the answer to the question "Did George Washington have a mole on his left leg?" is not only unknown but unknowable in the same strict sense as "will this electron have spin up if I measure its spin along the z axis?" - meaning that the current state of the world is a superposition of states in which the question has different answers.</p>
<p>Some facts about the past are fixed because we have records of those facts, but most facts are not of that sort - there's just not stuff around to store all data about all past events.    So, while for some questions about the past it is merely impractical to dig through currently available data to determine what happened, for some others it is strictly impossible.   </p>
<p>(It's very hard to tell which is which: we might someday discover a journal where George Washington complained about the mole on his left leg, or carry out some sophisticated analysis of the soil in Mount Vernon, beyond the abilities of current technology, to answer this question.)</p>

<p>Makes sense. To what extent do you think answering "sorry, that's not in Crime and Punishment" to the question about the mole and answering "sorry, that's not determined by the axioms of ZF" to the question "does every epi in Set split?" are analogous?</p>

<p>Sounds similar.   Philosophers like to talk about whether there's a "fact of the matter" about this or that.  I don't think there's a "fact of the matter" about questions of whether epis split in Set, over and above the axioms we choose to define Set. </p>
<p>Maybe the axioms of set theory are less like <em>Crime and Punishment</em> than some tale that comes in many variant versions that people argue over, like a Greek myth.</p>

<p>Rather than that Raskolnikov is concrete, I'd say that George Washington is abstract.  We abstract George Washington from various material instantiations that we regard as particular points in his life, and it's not just a matter of collecting these material instantiations as we need a certain level of abstraction to even be able to <em>ask</em> counterfactual questions about George Washington.  Further, you get slightly different abstractions in case you consider George Washington as a particular human person versus an historical personage.  In the latter case, in particular, you might want to regard things he hasn't and actually definitely <em>wouldn't</em> do as part of "George Washington", or for example consider thoughts he expected to be inferred as more important than actual thoughts, because both these things impinge heavily on the historical narrative, both actually and as-told.</p>

<p>Further, I would strongly argue, when it comes to phenomenology, that is, objects, concepts, events, etc that we perceive within our minds, we don't have access to any "bottom" to the abstraction "ladder" as sensory perception is a process of abstraction from beginning to end.  It's not all that clear that there's a "bottom" to the "ladder" ontologically either, although in that case I think you could at least argue for it, but it wouldn't be anything close to what we perceive as a "thing".</p>
