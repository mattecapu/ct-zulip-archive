<p>you probably know jim jarmush' movie permanent vacation? it was after he dropped out of school. some of us took it seriously and followed suit. maybe i should consider the rest of my life as just faltering on that path. i am looking forward to hearing more about the permanence of permanent sabbaticals :)</p>

<p>Since I'm going to work for a month at the Topos Institute this summer, and I'll do lots of other stuff, I don't think of this next phase of life as a permanent vacation.   Permanent sabbatical is closer.  I actually think of it as "freedom".</p>

<p>i didn't mean to suggest that you would be on a permanent vacation. it's a jim jarmush movie. the idea it might be interpreted that way didn't cross my mind. sorry. i only mentioned it because it's about our generation when they were very young, and the idea of permanence was kind of funny. permanent freedom sounds fantastic. congratulations :)</p>

<p>The phrase "permanent vacation" instantly made me scared because I've read, and I believe, that people who treat retirement as a vacation don't do well.   Most people can't really stand a permanent vacation, it seems.</p>

<p>besides apologizing for clumsily using the phrase, i should perhaps explain that it didn't occur to me that i should be careful because the concept of "retirement" with respect to someone from my generation... not from my generation, maybe from my <em>context</em> --- the concept of retirement just  doesn't ring a bell. i would first need to identify with some job in order to be able to retire. John Baez has been a sort of a categorical concept since the times of Bob Dobbs. (i immediately said YESSS when i realized that the categorical narrative might resurrect on the web, after the unfortunate comedies and tragedies it went through. tho i confess that i didn't think that it could it work, so it was credo quia absurdum... but i guess it works.) in any case, it didn't cross my mind that some HR out there might make a difference for a categorical concept...</p>
<p>i say this with full honesty and complete conviction. thou shalt not retire. no chance. worrying about that is a waste of energy.</p>

<p>well. the <em>second</em> time i quit academia was after i had to stop being a mathematician and become a computer scientist (family reasons) so i got a job at a CS dept and they have all these conferences, so i presented one paper in a hotel above the treeline in the amazonian rain forest, and the next one in pisa, and the next one on the ile de reunion off the coast of africa, and then again in italy, with a 7-course conference dinner in the village winery... so i said i don't want to travel <em>from vacation to vacation</em> to convince people that i had a good idea yesterday, i need to <em>build stuff</em> (like i did when i was a programmer). so i quit academia for the second time. it also quadrupled the salary. and then 10 years later i took a 65% pay cut to stop <em>building stuff</em>. that year we had a conference in moscow, and then in iceland... nothing is permanent, but i think it is fair to say that many scientists love vacations.</p>

<p>Thanks!  It's true I can't quit trying to do interesting stuff, at least not yet.  But I'm filling out lots of paperwork that says "retirement", and I'll stop teaching courses, which has been my main form of work for 30 years, and also ceasing to have grad students, at least for a while, and finishing up all my half-written papers with coauthors so I can make a fresh start: there's just one left.   So it feels like a big change.</p>

<p>I don't think of conferences as vacations, but I know what you mean - they seem to be the way academics try to reward themselves.  It's bad to be zipping around the planet the way successful academics do; I realized a while back that was the biggest part of my carbon footprint, and I've tried, with partial success, to cut back.</p>

<p>To quit going to conferences it helps to "fall out of fashion" and stop caring about the latest hot topics.   The older I get, the less I care about the latest fads, mainly because I've developed my ideas of what's interesting  - and I don't need a job, so I don't need to convince anyone that I'm doing something fashionable.  It helps that nobody has ever forced me to get grants.</p>

<p>Well, we have lots of committees to do the various kinds of work the department needs done.  As you advance, the chair of the department starts wanting you to head more and more of those committees.    For example, I've been in charge of hiring visiting assistant professors... and this year I was in charge of graduate courses.  I see why this sort of work needs to be done, and the work I've done so far has not been onerous compared to what <em>some</em> people do - but I could see which way this was heading, so I'm glad to jump ship.</p>
<p>The ultimate sacrifice would be to become the chair of the department.</p>

<p>My department hasn't been able to appoint a head for the past three years or so. We tried, and the old person stayed on in an acting capacity...until he retired in February! We now have another acting head, who now has agreed to serve for a second six months, but I gather doesn't actually want the position.<br>
It doesn't help that Sydney University's maths department (much more prestigious than us) is now also advertising for a head, and louder.</p>

<p>Well, we have lots of committees to do the various kinds of work the department needs done.  As you advance, the chair of the department starts wanting you to head more and more of those committees.    For example, I've been in charge of hiring visiting assistant professors... and this year I was in charge of graduate courses.  I see why this sort of work needs to be done, and the work I've done so far has not been onerous compared to what <em>some</em> people do - but I could see which way this was heading, so I'm glad to jump ship.</p>
<p>The ultimate sacrifice would be to become the chair of the department.</p>

<p>when i become a grad student, my first salary was 1503 gulden, and my previous feelance programmer salary was 7500 gulden, so my thesis advisor was sort of stunned that i accepted it.  he thought about it and said: "i know what you mean. you want to be an academic. you don't want to be rich. you don't want to sit in meetings, to manage budgets and sort out conflicts. you don't want to play political games and hate your enemies. as your academic career advances, you will be spending more and more time in meetings, you will be managing more and more money and people. political games will catch up with you, and to prevent your enemies from doing terrible things you will be spending most of your time in meetings, on management, budgets and conflicts. the only one of your original commitments that you will fulfill will be that you won't get rich."</p>

<p>it is a surprisingly difficult question, even if restricted to a single sample.</p>
<p>that science as a social process that dwindles back to politics (just done by blundering amateurs) seems largely true. i am not happy to say this. most of my best friends are influential academics. they are good honest people. but there is no denying that most research communities behave like political parties, and many of the people wielding most power in science are those who replace their  research programs by strategic behaviors. (science as an evolutionary interaction between our species and nature seems to develop a level above. or behind our backs: the internet was developed for the case of nuclear war; the web to distribute physics preprints; CRISPR arose from classifying antiviral mechanisms...)</p>
<p>is the sinkhole of politics inescapable for individual scientists? that is where the question becomes difficult. people like grothendieck and perlman simply say no. jon beck (of monadicity theorem) said no in a different way. simon norton (of monster group and monstrous moonshine) was a bit like perlman. is it possible to do science without participating in the politics of it? grothendieck's work after he quit seems to be nowadays more read and more influential than the SGAs. but if he was happy and did not write all his desperate letters and esquisses, we would never know.</p>
<p>on the opposite end of the gamut is jh simons (of chern-simons and the simons foundation), who said no and got rich. some will say that he quit doing math. others will say that he took the notion of applied math seriously. both are right in their way. there are other examples of people who got reasonably rich applying their math, esp in the bay area, and remained happy. descartes started using his coordinates to fortify breda, to get paid. and there are surely many other people who followed their own paths, and we never heard of them.</p>
<p>i am tempted to pontificate that it is possible to escape the sinkhole by remaining honest and following the logic, not the herd. that seems to have been possible for my generation, with some luck. but everything seems harder now...</p>
<p>sorry, you got me going. its a life of brian.</p>

<p>I got lucky and found an institution where I could do what I want, earn a good living, not be pressured to get grants.   There are definitely problems with a "second-rate" institution like UCR, and problems with not getting a lot of grant money to support my grad students, but overall I think it was better to take that route than to struggle to get a job at a "first-rate" institution and get grants all the time.</p>

<p>I am still supervising students, although gonna do that mostly in Maths and Physics in the future, and in in CS department there are of course also Aleks Kissinger and Sam Staton.  In fact, we bring in some PhD money.  Some also just come work with me at CQC, rather than PhD.  It made it a bit difficult this year as what qualifies as a PhD paper.  Expanding the definition of academia is good, and necessary!  We are doing that as well.  (one floor in our new offices is Topos-Oxford btw)</p>

<p>For what is worth, my goal for the next few years is bridging Applied Category Theory with the Crypto community. There is a lot of research going on in Crypto that is not "classically" academic. But there is also a lot of money available, and they are in great need of categorical tools, even if they don't know about it. I'm involved in a big project at the moment, if everything goes according to plan I think we will be able to hire a few applied category theorists in a few months. It's not exactly "revolutionizing the space" but this is the best I'm able to do at the moment.</p>

<p>Also, politics in Crypto is very different.

<p>Zooming out, probably the real problem here is that in the last decades we had this mind-shift of "unis ran as they were companies". This is absolute garbage for a lot of reasons. Practically, you also get universities that often act like they are competing with companies. They are doomed to fail tho because all the involved bureaucracy makes them totally uncompetitive. I'm pretty sure things would be different if unis would just fullfill their real purpose: Being public institutions that do research for the common good.</p>

<p>I think most people do not need a degree to be good at the job they want. But it has become the accepted thing that many employers want to see an undergraduate degreeat least. So much so that students (or their parents, or whoever) will pay a great deal to go to university. </p>
<p>I think changing this could help universities be less like corporations, competing with each other, etc, and focus more on research (and teaching, which keeps research going from one generation to the next). Probably making other pathways is a good place to start: apprenticeships, etc.</p>
<p>There is also the "problem" that most people want the social experience of university life, but maybe alternative pathways could offer a similar experience in time.</p>
<p>Of course, the bureaucratic side of universities wouldn't like any such change, because that's their business gone.</p>

<p>But things can happen a lot faster. The point is that if you have a good research project in mind and you can shill it in the right way you can get money to work on it very quickly, whereas for many grant applications it's a process that takes months.</p>

<p>The main downside is where the money goes actually. When you get a grant, it goes through the uni and you are not receiving the money directly, so tax-wise everything is taken care of. With crypto you have two choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go through unis, that usually demand a (big) share of the money for the simple fact that you exist within them. This also means you need to already have a university affiliation.</li>
<li>The money goes directly to yourself. This can be immensely good or immensely bad depending on the juristiction you live in. The main problem is that in many country (in Italy for sure) there is no way of justifying money coming into your account in any other way than as income</li>

<p>The real problem here is that crypto is a truly global financial network, so local jurisdictions are often ill-prepared in dealing with it. For instance, Bitcoin is not a legal entity, it's more similar to a common good. If someone steals your money, who do you sue? What jurisdiction is responsible for chasing the criminals? Bitcoin being incorporated nowhere, I guess the answer would be "the country you live in", but everything is very murky</p>

<p>I like Twitter.  I use it to explain math to a bunch of people who might otherwise not bump into it.  I like to write a blog article with details, and then a tweet-series that links to that.</p>

<p>one possible interpretation is that the social media thing is not so particularly new. </p>
<p>for a better part of history, the social influencers competed for followers, converting them from the dionysian to the hadean cults, from judaism to christianity, from christianity to islam... the scope of the broadcasts was different when the influencers had to travel from village to village, or yell from a hill, but the type of communication was similar. then various factors (people with horses instead of religions, pandemics...) drew attention to the reality, so science got invented, which sort of says that the information content should be selected not by how effectively it can be compressed to influence people, but how effectively it can be expanded to influence the reality. which requires longer messages, studying, passing messages from generation to generation, avoiding testable lies. but that seems to have worked to well, so they made a hammer so big that they hit themselves on the head, and started believing in elon musk flying to mars and digging tunnels, and remembered how much fun it was to get drunk in dionysian cults, and to believe in the hadean stories. especially when you get paid real money for telling them...</p>
<p>the only thing that is new is that all the unreasonable effectiveness of the mathematics in science, and of the science in reality, are <em>behind</em> us, and that the hammer is in the process of falling on our head from roughly that direction.</p>
<p>i hope this is just another bulshit story, just slightly too long for social media.</p>

<p>DAI is completely based on fine-tuned game theory. It's a fairly complicated system that for now has held really well in the most absurd conditions, and it's completely trustless. But you shouldn't take my word for it, you should see the docs. And then it wouldn't be a matter of  "trusting this or that", but in believing that the boundary conditions of their model are or aren't appropriate, as it should be.</p>

<p>(USDT is completely against the whole ethos of crypto. There is no point in having a decentralized system that is based on a "hey, trust me, we have one dollar in our vault for every USDT we mint". At that point you can just use a bank account, the level of trust is similar and it probably comes with more protection for the clients.)</p>

<p>Sounds like google has <em>hidden</em> that meaning of "crypto".  <span aria-label="smirk" class="emoji emoji-1f60f" role="img" title="smirk">:smirk:</span></p>

<p>I hate it, but it's true that crypto now means cryptocurrency instead of cryptography.  The amount of money and attention just completely overwhelmed the previous meaning.  Cryptography doesn't even make the first two pages of Google hits for "crypto".  </p>
<p>I guess it brings up the interesting etymological question of whether there are other words that completely changed meaning over the course of just a few years.</p>

<p>I still live in a world where it definitely doesn't mean "cryptocurrency" LOL. I think a lot of people are going to feel pretty silly when that fad dies down. sorry!</p>

<p>To be honest I don't think there is any need for it to 'revert'... I have only heard gold-rushers using crypto in this sense --- so the rest of us can use it as a 'reverse shibboleth'. I think it still means the usual thing among both cryptographers and non-cryptographers.</p>

<p>But I don't want to get into a flamewar on this channel. I'm content to wait until the goldrushers have moved onto breathlessly evangelizing the next thing, once cryptocurrency is forgotten.</p>

<p>It's difficult not getting into a flamewar after you described crypto as a fraud and the countless people that work with it (many of them with the best intentions) as goldrushers. I'm curious to know if you had the same opinion with the early Internet. One should be able to separate the value of the technology with the countless endeavors to exploit it that pop up like mushrooms.</p>
<p>About Diel, he for sure despises me, but at least in my case it's fully reciprocal.</p>

<p>Fwiw, I'm working on <a href="http://radicle.xyz">radicle.xyz</a> which is attempting to create an economic ecosystem (as well as a decentralized one) for FOSS (free open source software) using a token called RAD. The first economic feature is to give patronage to others but the token also acts as a voting mechanism to deploy smart contracts that affect the token itself. I'm not deep into the cryptocurrency scene but I think this is at least a good mission to be working on <span aria-label="blush" class="emoji emoji-1f60a" role="img" title="blush">:blush:</span></p>

<p>It is, but you know, crypto has no real value and it's a Ponzi scheme, so your argument is invalid.</p>
