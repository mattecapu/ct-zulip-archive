<p>Yes, I was referring to the fact that nearly everyone believes P to be not equal to NP. The only notable exception I know of is Donald Knuth, which anyway believes that "P = NP, but an algorithm to reduce a NP-complete problem to a P one is too complicated for humans to be ever able to find it", which means, in practice, that for many things he still believes you can safely rely on what P != NP implies</p>

<p>What matters for encryption is that no feasible solution to these problems will ever be found.  And by "feasible" I mean in the ordinary woolly sense, not "polytime".  A feasible non-polytime solution would damage encryption.  An infeasible polytime solution would not.  Nor would it damage encryption if a feasible solution exists but nobody ever finds it.</p>

<p>I would argue that this is a little different to the previous discussion about models of PA, in that P vs NP is a question about our eventual ability to do efficiently things that we already know we can do, and can be restated (thanks to the existence of NP-complete problems) in terms of our ability to algorithmically solve just a single, concrete, scalable problem. Thus it's a lot more reasonable to assume it's true or false, that "the answer is out there" before it is proved either way, or even if it never is.</p>

<p>There are different degrees of belief, though, and it's completely reasonable to believe neither "P" nor "not P" if one means a sufficiently strong degree of belief.</p>

<p>A feasible non-polytime solution can be acceptable. If it depends exponentially on the size of the input, you just pick a bigger input. This is precisely what we do with, say, RSA, where every once in a while experts suggest to pick keys of bigger size</p>

<p>It may be set to stall for a while in the near future, but the exponential growth of computer power is pretty well documented. Sure, "eventually" might be very far in the future, and for some algorithms like the one in the paper you cite might never arrive or require some major optimization to avoid needing all of the atoms in the universe to perform the computation, but the point is that whenever feasibility is reached for a given polytime algorithm, there are major consequences, and you can't know before a proof exists how far from "eventually" we might be for a given problem.</p>

<p>this thread seems to be dead [bad joke removed]. </p>
<p>but while the P vs NP problem might be a dead end by the usual low-level-programming methods of complexity theory, i think there are a couple of things that might be worth young category theorists' attention :)</p>
<p>1) the P vs NP question is a popular vista point on the tip of the iceberg of the question <em>what can be feasibly computed</em>, and <em>what can be feasibly hidden</em>. there are a couple of layers on the iceberg that have been spelled out, but ground to a halt in the  low-level mess.</p>
<p>suppose that all problems in P are easy. P=NP then means that there are no hard problems: you give me a source, say a ciphertext, and i can compute any information that it contains. (such was shannon's world: if there is a statistical correlation, the cryptanalyst will find a lever to move the information.)</p>
<p>however, it may happen that P=/=NP but AP=ANP. that means that some problems have hard instances, but they are easy on average. hard instances infeasible to find. (this is what worried leonid levin, when he proceeded,  after his very elegant "cook-levin thesis", to develop the very messy average-case complexity theory.)</p>
<p>and then there is impagliazzo's thesis. suppose that we have a problem that is hard on the average, and thus ANP=/=AP. the chance that we can guess hard instances of a problem is not always correlated with the chance that we can guess <em>solved instances</em>. so it may happen that there are plenty of hard problems, but that it is unfeasible to construct one-way functions. (levin constructed his universal one-way function trying to derive it from a vanilla ANP problem, but failed.)</p>
<p>and to split the last hair, suppose there are plenty of hard problems with solutions, which allows you to construct one-way functions. to make it into a trapdoor function, you need to provide a succinct encoding of the solution. aka the KEY of the cipher. is it not possible that we can construct lots of one-way functions, but the size of their solutions for the hard direction grows intractably, and we still cannot build crypto systems with short keys? </p>
<p>well yes, we know at least one line of constructions that would make this possible. which brings us to (2).</p>
<p>but i don't want to bore you. this is already too long, and prolly too heavy. if anyone is interested, i can tell more l8r.</p>

<p>yes, it is impagliazzo's universes. the task was to prove that they are different. impagliazzo worked distinguishing two of them, levin other two, widgerson other two. impagliazzo told the story in terms of universes. it's an unusually clear vision. all of the tasks are still open, certainly not for a lack of effort, or brilliance. but some problems require method, not cleverness. i tend to think that category theory might be a good candidate for providing high level method.</p>

<p>in fact, there has been a bit of progress. we do have the robertson-seymour theory providing family of algorithms where everything is in P, but cannot be succinctly encoded. so it is possible that our current hard problems with succinct certificates are not hard, and that there are hard problems, but no succinct certificates. or that there there are no hard problems, but we will never know, because the solutions of easy problems are too big. that's knuth.</p>

<p>in any case, i am somehow thinking that category theory has been happier when it made complicated things simple than when it proceeded to make itself complicated. and complexity theory and cryptography have made themselves so complicated that they pertty much ground to a halt. so if categories helped with programming languages, they might help with algorithms.</p>

<p>Possibly quite a bit. Some thoughts:</p>

<li>Andreas Blass <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9309208" title="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9309208">observed in 1993</a> that Valeria de Paiva's work on Dialectica categories is useful in thinking about many-to-one reductions in the kind of decision problems that are considered in the theory of computational complexity.</li>

<p>yes, this paper of Andreas is very tantalizing. I've don some work with Samuel Gomes da Silva on applications of Blass' ideas to set theory (Dialectica categories, cardinalities of the continuum and combinatorics of ideals,, 2018), but I don't know of any work on complexity theory, stemming from Blass.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>That is a nice concrete technical question. I have a concrete technical answer. I hope i'll upload it to arxiv within a month or so. It's a whole textbook. I have had the "good fortune" to be tasked with teaching computability and complexity every once in a while since 1995. Since roughly 2008, the course was mostly in string diagrams. Since 2016, it's been an undergraduate course. You never say the word "category", but draw pictures. Acceptable systems of indices are a simple monoidal structure. Then complexity measures are projections of Kleene's normal form. That is the idea. But making it useful takes a while. The early versions were pretty silly, and maybe the current one still is. I am rewriting the final chapter 4th time. That's not a good sign. But that can only be my own personal silliness. There must be a way to do complexity theory categorically, just like there must be a way for objects heavier than air, and different from birds, to fly in the air. It just takes time.</p>

<p>if there is a chance that old and tired category theorists might be interested to contribute here, then i would try to spell it out in more detail.   there are aspects where that kind of investment would i think make a difference.</p>

<p>Yup, that's implicit in my question. I've seen several examples of these, so it's made me cautiously optimistic: cautious because people tend to want to shoehorn categories in without regard for the details, but optimistic because eventually a solution would present itself.</p>

Indeed, the summary there reads just like your interpretation, but to me it seems like exactly the opposite: the massive strength of relativisation is that, when done carefully, it precisely controlled the parametricity of proofs. For example, in topos theory, we have (informally speaking) that everything than can be proven constructively applies over every topos, but anything requiring excluded middle applies only over Boolean toposes, anything relying on de Morgan's law applies only over de Morgan toposes etc. If one defines oracles as "base objects" with enough structure that cases can similarly be distinguished (I'm not going to push toposes, but... they are <em>right there</em>...), it seems like a great approach to take, especially given that complexity really <em>should</em> be a relative concept, even in applications: if we find a black box that makes some algorithm really cheap to run, that necessarily changes the complexity theory landscape.</p>

<p>The main reason why it is hard to put category theory and algorithmics together is that both are branches of mathematics theorized about to a large extent in English. But people philosophize about algorithms because the actual models are too verbose because they are low level, and categories get verbose for different reasons. In any case, people seem much more likely to be impressionistic about algorithms and about categories than about, say, neural nets, or about heart diseases, where they seem to be much more likely to grab tools than to talk. That is at least my impression ;)</p>

<p>Other work by Fellows is also worth checking. A very understated guy, with some very sharp results and insights. I got most re the paremetErized project from his book with Downey. </p>
<p>(really parametErized? maybe parametErize is not the same thing as parametrize. maybe it means: "Express your measurements in metric, but vaguely: the distance from A to B is 13 pm, where pm may be mm, cm, or km." I am pretty sure that is what they mean.)</p>

<p>Parametrized complexity is very useful for connecting back to the practical success or failure of algorithms (eg why is it that many instances of SAT can be solved in practice, even though SAT is NP-hard?). But it does not "explain away" the difficulty of P vs NP. Indeed, many of the standard conjectures in parametrized complexity imply P vs NP, so the parametrized conjectures, while perhaps more relevant to practice, are in fact <em>even harder</em> than separating P from NP.</p>

<p>On a related note: if anyone has suggestions of where a mathematically inclined complexity theorist such as myself could read about linear logic in a way that might be useful for the above approach, I'd much appreciate it! The papers we were reading were interesting, but it was very slow-going (I think partly because the papers were about linear logic in general, which seemed much more general than the goal I was aiming for).</p>

Yeesh keeping track of predicativity seems exhausting. Isn't it a little ironic to be so blatantly impredicative as "The entailment relation refers here to all structures of the appropriate vocabulary," in the metalogic? I suppose you have to be impredicative eventually or you can't prove anything in any generality...</p>

<p>People have mentioned linear logic a couple of times, but I'd like to press on this a bit. Ugo dal Lago has a whole line of work (under the name "implicit complexity theory", going back to Bellantoni-Cook) more or less rephrasing complexity classes in terms of linear logic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be pedantic, the Bellantoni-Cook recursion theory approach to implicit complexity is quite different from linear logic and the first LL-based implicit complexity result is Girard, Scedrov and Scott's <em>Bounded Linear Logic</em> which came out the same year (1992) and which I assume was discovered independently. Also, this line of work was already quite active in the French-Italian linear logic community before Ugo dal Lago entered the field (but he indeed contributed a lot!).</p>

<p>my goal was to try and figure out whether the linear logic view on complexity classes (a la dal Lago (is that almost a palindrome?!)) could actually lead to new ideas for separating complexity classes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Damiano Mazza, who has a lot of experience in the field, is rather pessimistic about such prospects. See section 4.2.1 of <a href="https://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/~mazza/papers/Habilitation.pdf">https://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/~mazza/papers/Habilitation.pdf</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this respect, logical approaches have proved to be of no use so far.  Descriptive  complexity  [Imm99],  based  on  finite  model  theory,  has  been  quite successful at characterizing nearly every well-known complexity class.  However,  it  has  provided  no  workable  ideas  concerning  lower  bounds.   Implicit computational  complexity,  which  is  one  of  the  topics  we  touched  upon  in this  thesis,  is  situated  at  the  other  end  of  the  logical  spectrum,  at  the  interface  between  recursion  theory,  type  theory  and  the  theory  of  programming languages.  This approach too seems to be worthless when it comes to lower bound techniques.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think that's one of his motivations for turning to other topics at the interface of categories and complexity theory, such as the topos-theoretic viewpoint on CSPs which I mentioned earlier in this thread.</p>

<p>On a related note: if anyone has suggestions of where a mathematically inclined complexity theorist such as myself could read about linear logic in a way that might be useful for the above approach, I'd much appreciate it!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sadly I don't really have a source to recommend, I basically learned this stuff by talking with people who were working on it. One issue is that you would have to learn proof nets at some point and I don't know if there exists a good exposition of them (I mean, including exponential boxes; purely multiplicative proof nets have been used by people outside the Girard school, e.g. category theorists and deep inference proof theorists, so they are more likely to have been clearly explained somewhere).</p>

<p>Anyway, if people are interested in separating complexity classes using ideas coming from linear logic, I have to advertise Thomas Seiller's work (disclaimers: he's my PhD advisor, and there's no category theory involved). The idea is to represent various models of computation as generalized dynamical systems (think measure theory / ergodic theory), with this representation being initially inspired by semantics of linear logic (more precisely by "geometry of interaction" which is also at the heart of some of Dal Lago's results on logspace). I recommend reading his programmatic paper <a href="https://www.seiller.org/documents/articles/towards.pdf">https://www.seiller.org/documents/articles/towards.pdf</a></p>

<p>Thanks! I am not so familiar with this line of work - I mentioned dal Lago only because I had seen a bunch of papers by him on the topic. It is useful to have a quick overview of the history, such as what you wrote. Good to know.</p>
