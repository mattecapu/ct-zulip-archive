<p>During the winter vacations I wanted to code something for fun with Svelte 5, and I also reminded myself that I always wanted to have a basic visual diagram editor that generates tikzcd code and which is intuitive and easy to use*. So I made the <a href="https://tikzcd-creator.netlify.app/">tikzcd creator</a>. Please check it out and let me know what you think! The idea of the user interface is to make it <em>dead simple</em> and also enjoyable to use. Even on mobile. The diagram is generated <em>step by step</em>.</p>

<p>*Nothing against <a href="https://q.uiver.app/">quiver</a>, but for me it's a bit too complex <span aria-label="face in clouds" class="emoji emoji-1f636-200d-1f32b" role="img" title="face in clouds">:face_in_clouds:</span> . Notice that the tikzcd creator is way less advanced than quiver!</p>
<p>PS: I was not so sure if this is the correct channel to announce such projects. I saw the clowder project has been announced here. But there is also "community: our work" and "practice: software". Please let me know if it is more appropriate there. Then my next big announcement ( <span aria-label="shushing face" class="emoji emoji-1f92b" role="img" title="shushing face">:shushing_face:</span>) will be there. ;)</p>

<p>Hi!   I like your thesis!</p>
<p>If you post to "community: our work" the tradition would be for you to start a thread called "Martin Brandenburg" and occasionally tell us what you're doing.   </p>
<p>I forget what people do on "practice: software", but that might be good too.</p>

<p>(For what it's worth, if there are aspects of <strong>quiver</strong> that you find make it difficult to use, I would like to hear about them so I can improve the experience.)</p>

<p>The tikzcd creator is neat!</p>
<p>I find it a little unintuitive that (if I understand correctly) it forces you to proceed step by step, first creating all the nodes, then all the arrows, then all the labels, etc.  At first I thought it was just walking me through the  steps in the tutorial, but if so I can't find a way to get out of the tutorial.</p>

<p>Thanks for the feedback!</p>
<p>Yeah that's basically the whole idea of this application: to develop the diagram step by step. The reason is that personally (!) I am overwhelmed with a menu where I can do everything at a time (that would be kind of the alternative I guess), and I wouldn't know immediately what to use which for. So my idea was to focus just on one task. And let the UI guide you.<br>
Maybe it isn't working for everyone, though.<br>
I also noticed that this approach works best if I already have a diagram on paper and would like to TeX it.<br>
Developing a new diagram with my editor is unfortunately a mess because for these diagrams you will most certainly not do all the nodes, all the arrows, etc. but rather jump between the steps.<br>
Maybe I should add breadcrumbs or something like that so that jumping is easier.<br>
Or just ditch the whole step by step approach <span aria-label="laughing" class="emoji emoji-1f606" role="img" title="laughing">:laughing:</span></p>

<p>Or maybe both. I could keep the current "tutorial" (as you name it), and once it's finished, don't show this type of UI again, but rather a menu which makes it possible to edit everything at once. I will think about it.</p>

<p>Alright, will do that! I think I will choose the existing quiver conversation for that. But as mentioned, these might be things that aren't necessarily relevant for all users.</p>
