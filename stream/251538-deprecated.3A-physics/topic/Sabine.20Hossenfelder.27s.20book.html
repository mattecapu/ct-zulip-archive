<p>(Context: student of mathematical/theoretical physics here. Also, this accidentally turned into a bit of an essay — sorry!)</p>
<p>One of the things I took from Hossenfelder's book was her call for more serious consideration of the social structures underpinning science. This comes up also in Smolin's book in a different form (I haven't gotten hold of a copy of Woit's yet). But it was from Hossenfelder's discussion of various cognitive and social biases in play, that I got the sense that there was more to the "sociological aspects of science" than just managing the power dynamics between various camps/research programmes.</p>
<p>I recall some of Hossenfelder's arguments involving very apt historical examples of long-ago natural philosophers using their own notions of beauty/naturalness/etc. to defend theories that we now know to be false. This made me reflect that my own physics education thus far has been missing any sufficiently-in-depth learning about the history of physics.</p>
<p>The more physicists capable of individually analyzing "philosophical" arguments about naturality, multiverses, anthropic principle, beauty, etc., the more resilient physics-as-a-whole would be to some of the biases Hossenfelder talks about. Most physicists I know learn more by example/familiarity than by abstract or structural reasoning (lots of physicists prefer <em>calculations</em> over <em>theorems</em>). So I'd guess that most theoretical physicists would be better equipped to evaluate such "philosophical" arguments  by expanding their stock of historical examples of failed theories, the arguments that supported them, and how exactly they ended up failing.</p>
<p>But the physics education I've received, at least, has had an obvious focus on teaching only those theories that <em>haven't failed</em> in this way. (For good reason I suppose — getting to grips with currently accepted or proposed theories is tough enough for a student, without having to learn failed or abandoned theories as well…)</p>
<p>Of course at some point, it is up to students to learn such things themselves. However, for some of the very same "sociological" reasons these authors have discussed, most non-historian students of theoretical physics probably won't choose to spend much of their time learning history.</p>
<p>Maybe this is a bit more "meta" than what Hossenfelder was aiming for when she called for greater consideration of the sociology, but anyway this is where my thoughts ended up.</p>

<p>Kelvin had a theory that atoms were knots in the aether.... this was a cute idea and there was a bit of a flurry of work based on this.  The idea of matter as knots ended up being declared "wrong" but knot theory hibernated in mathematics for about a 100 years until spreading back over to physics again. How crazy is that?</p>

<p>Does anyone actually teach the aether theory of light?   People <em>talk</em> about it a lot in physics courses, but I don't remember them seriously <em>teaching</em> it - with equations and the like.   I couldn't do it myself.   But I'll be able to in a year, because I've just started reading Sir Edmund Whittaker's monumental 2-volume book <em>A History of the Theories of Aether and Electricity</em>.   So far it's really good.  I've only gotten to Descartes' aether theory, which was very influential but only qualitative - words more than equations - and discredited before Newton came on the scene.</p>

<p>I find Hossenfelder's book (and other writings) to be far to negative and humorless. Let's bring down the particle physicists a few notches, sure, but there is so much other interesting stuff going on in physics &amp; mathematical physics. It's really seems like a golden age of discovery to me. Not some dried up husk that Hossenfelder keeps going on about.</p>

<p>Yes.  And there were plenty of people arguing against this route all along.   I've always argued against supersymmetry and I didn't think the LHC was worthwhile, though now that it's been done I think it's had a clarifying effect: the Standard Model is very accurate up to this energy scale, and there's no hint so far supersymmetry at the electroweak symmetry breaking energy scale.</p>

<p>So (mentioned in Chapter 4) there's the example of Tycho Brahe defending a geocentric model of the solar system against heliocentrism. More-or-less, since measurements of parallax weren't so good at the time, Brahe ended up figuring that heliocentrism demanded that the stars had to be much bigger than the Sun and/or much further away than the planets, by factors that he considered unnaturally large (for the modern physics sense of naturality).</p>
<p>A review by Jeremy Butterfield (a philosopher of science) pointed out another example, but I don't think it actually came up in Hossenfelder's book: Aristotle apparently insisted that light is a "transparency of the medium" (Butterfield's words — I've never read any Aristotle) rather than a propagation (of waves, particles, anything else) because he observed that at sunrise, the whole large area gets lit up at once, and that this demands any light propagation be faster than anything else he was familiar with, by factors too large for his comfort (again, a naturalness argument).</p>
<p>One notable thing about these examples (in contrast to the aether example) is that they both predate "modern" or "empirical" science. So maybe what I'm trying to get at is this: some of the ideas up for debate in books like Hossenfelder's, Smolin's, Woit's etc. require <em>post-empirical</em> arguments (in the words of Dawid, "String Theory and the Scientific Method"). But maybe we should be learning historical examples of <em>pre-empirical</em> arguments in physics, and whether/how they failed, to make sure any attempts at <em>post-empirical</em> reasoning avoid the same pitfalls.</p>

<p>I wouldn't call geocentrism a "bogus theory", since in the hands of Ptolemy it produced results of high accuracy, better than Copernicus' crude heliocentric theory.  It turned out to be wrong, but "bogus" is an undeserved insult.</p>

<p>Anyone interested in the story of wrong turns in physics after Newton would enjoy Helge Kragh's book <em>Higher Speculations: Grand Theories and Failed Revolutions in Physics and Cosmology</em>.   I especially enjoyed the part before 1950 because I didn't know as much about those older theories.</p>
<p>For example, around 1895-1915 there were a bunch of good physicists trying to explain all physics, including the electron, using Maxwell's equations or mild variants.</p>

<p>Smolin has some interesting comments to make here in this interview <a href="https://youtu.be/WgLo4gmEraU?t=3960">https://youtu.be/WgLo4gmEraU?t=3960</a> . He seems to be saying that his "trouble with physics" was not specific to string theory, but that's just what he chose to write about at that time. It was more of a sociological critique of physics that he was wanting to write.</p>

<p>One problem is that quantum field theory, being nonrigorous and very complex, is quite hard to learn: there are a lot of different formulations, each involving some rigorous math but also some rules of thumb and some optimistic guesses.   Since physicists tend to be in a hurry, tend to rely on what they've heard from other physicists, rather than understanding everything in detail and clearly distinguishing between what's known for sure, what <em>might</em> be true, etc.   This tends to make group-think a bigger problem than in some other areas.</p>

<p>Oh yes, he's <em>very</em> sympathetic to these.    We completely disagree on the probability that these ideas will connect to real-world physics.   We fight about that all the time, and that's one reason we don't talk much anymore.    I support what he's doing just because it's mathematically beautiful.  But it's not helping us understand the patterns in the Standard Model, the puzzles concerning neutrinos, dark matter... or in short, anything we can study experimentally.</p>

<p>To briefly sum up his argument there: he says string theory is a <em>theory</em>, inasmuch as QFT is one, and theories do not make predictions. What you need to make experimental predictions are <em>models</em>, which are theories + a bunch of arbitrary choices of parameters of the theories. So the Standard <em>Model</em> is indeed this: QFT + a choice of its free parameters, namely coupling constants (and something else? idk).<br>
Then he argues that string theory does have realistic models (<a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/string%20phenomenology#SemiRealisticModels">Semi-realistic models of string theory</a>) agreeing with <em>current</em> experiments, but the experiments who would discern between quantum gravity models are not there yet.</p>

<p>I found the distinction between model and theory quite on point. That said, I don't know enough string theory to be able to say if the second part is right, especially when so many people complain about the lack of experimental predictions. Shouldn't a theory make predictions <em>despite</em> the lack of fixed free parameters? e.g. Newton's law makes a clear prediction of gravity, which one could test experimentally even without knowing G (you test that <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>F</mi><mo>∝</mo><mi>m</mi><mi>M</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><msup><mi>r</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">F \propto mM/r^2</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">F</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mrel">∝</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1.064108em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">m</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.10903em;">M</span><span class="mord">/</span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.02778em;">r</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.8141079999999999em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>)</p>

<p>Maybe what happens here (something that Urs mentions later in the page) is that string theory's free parameters are not numbers, but higher objects like the geometry of spacetime compact dimensions or whatever. This makes it hard to make a definitive prediction up to a constant.</p>

<p>On the other hand you could argue that then either (a) everything we can measure would be fittable by a string theoretic models or (b) there is some data which would falsify any string theoretic model. Then in the first case you might say string theory isn't a good physical theory, since it's not falsifiable (though this argument feels stuck in 40s maybe), while in the second case you would have a definitive experimental prediction which is not bound by a choice of parameters, so string theory would make predictions</p>

<p>I don't think the real problem with superstring theory is that it doesn't make predictions. If it would make predictions that disagreed with the current state of the art we'd disregard it as wrong and we would go on. As you say, there aren't experiments that make superstring theory discernible from other theories, but then again, that would not be a problem per se. In principle, this being the case, any possible attack to superstring theory would be valid also towards quantum gravity, for instance</p>

<p>The second, probably deeper problem, is that the philosophical foundations of superstring theory are quite shaky. In principle, it is postulated for instance that there are fundamental lenghts, times, masses, etc: Everything is fully quantized, so for instance you cannot go below the Plank length. This by definition makes it not direactly measurable. This is in open contrast with the 400~ years old principle that you should be able to devise experiments that directly falsify or confirm some hypothesis</p>

<p>So, we need to find indirect reasons to prove that things are as superstring theory predicts. Again, this is in principle doable, but in my opinion having a theory that relies on such philosophical foundations makes it all the more prone to attack and criticism: We are going for a model of physics which, in this respect, is radically different from what we had up to now. It's natural that one wants a pretty damn compelling argument before accepting it.</p>

<p>BTW, I think the philosophical implications of superstring theory have been considered "not really important" by many in the community till recent times, mitigating, maybe, the relevance of good philosophical foundations. There's been a time in the recent history of physics when "shut up and calculate" was the mantra, that is: Absolute trust in the mathematical truths behind a model, with everything else being regarded as mere speculation. I can understand how this kind of attitude becomes mainstream in a research community, but I tend to consider it a bit toxic given the current state of affairs.</p>

<p>Well, this is partly true. If string theory manages to produce a theory of quantum gravity then there should be observable difference in high-energy systems such as black holes or particle colliders. The fact that those systems are hard to measure/work is not string theorists' fault.</p>

<p>It's not that string theory hasn't produced anything useful, it's more that it's failed to fulfil the promises which it made, which were the basis of the investment in the field. If someone keeps insisting that you pay them as a columnist in your newspaper and then they just produce a comic strip every week, they haven't failed to make a usable contribution, but they have failed to do what you're supposedly paying them for.</p>

<p>Please notice that this comparison is not unfair, nor theoretical. It is happening now. Some physicists have already started saying that we need a bigger particle accelerator and as a consequence some other physicists signed a petition where they say "please do not build any more particle accelerator, and use that money in a wiser way"</p>

<p>These discourses do not exist in a vacuum. We are talking about the careers of thousands of people, and about monstrous amounts of resources (financial, intellectual) that can be allocated to solve long-standing problems. When you think about if some research effort should or should not be worth pursuiting, you should think along these lines, especially at such a scale. The theoretical value of the research in question is only one of the things to factor in.</p>

<p>The second, probably deeper problem, is that the philosophical foundations of superstring theory are quite shaky. In principle, it is postulated for instance that there are fundamental lenghts, times, masses, etc: Everything is fully quantized, so for instance you cannot go below the Plank length. This by definition makes it not direactly measurable. This is in open contrast with the 400~ years old principle that you should be able to devise experiments that directly falsify or confirm some hypothesis</p>

<p>When you introduce supersymmetry into the game, you get theories (models, whatever) that at best can match the "minimal supersymmetric extension" of the Standard Model.

<p>The Jones polynomial was invented around 1984 when Vaughan Jones and Joan Birman had a conversation at lunch at the MSRI.  Both were mathematicians.  Jones was at a conference on von Neumann algebras (a kind of algebra invented for the purposes of physics, which however Jones was exploring in a purely mathematical way: he was classifying inclusions of type II subfactors).   Birman was at a conference on knot theory (which at the time was not connected to physics at all).   So we have to credit mathematicians for the Jones polynomial, not physicists.</p>
<p>But then Witten came along and showed around 1989 that the Jones polynomial has a nice explanation in terms of a 3d topological quantum field theory called Chern-Simons theory.  This sparked an enormous industry - which is what got me interested in category theory in the first place.</p>
<p>None of this yet involves real-world <em>experimental</em> physics.  It will become real-world physics if and when people succeed in creating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anyon#Non-abelian_anyons">nonabelian anyons</a> on thin superconducting films.   People have been trying for a long time, with no definitive success yet.  I feel sure they will eventually succeed, because condensed matter physics is very flexible. </p>
<p>There are a lot of hopes and dreams of making quantum computers using nonabelian anyons.    It's a huge amount of work to go from creating nonabelian anyons to controlling them well enough to get a working quantum computer.  I am much less optimistic about this.</p>

<p>It's hard to not agree with this! Or that those billions would be better spent on 'tackling climate change'.<br>
On the other hand, doesn't it feel like a slippery slope? There's always <em>something more important</em> to tackle first. But then, as humanity, we'd stagnate. And I have the impression that all the side, unexpected discoveries and technological advances one reaps from big-scale projects such as the LHC, or the Apollo program, couldn't be achieved through surgically targeted funding, mainly because serendipity plays a major role in even noticing the possibility one could achieve them.<br>
Finally, one should mention scientific megaprojects are far from being of 'extraordinary expensive'. For example, olympic games in the last twenty years have at least twice equalled the cost of building LHC (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_the_Olympic_Games">2004 and 2012, according to Wikipedia</a>). Or, quite famously, NASA budget <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_of_NASA#/media/File:NASA-Budget-Federal.svg">never surpassed 4% of US federal budget</a>, while military budget is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget_of_the_United_States#Budget_by_year">consistently 4x that</a>.<br>
One may consider budgets a boundary condition of scientific research, and thus deem the matter outside the scope of discussion, but so is climate change and the relevance of research topics then.<br>
I'm mostly playing the devil's advocate here...  To circle back to were we started, I agree string theory is a bad physical theory, and pretending it's a good one is either ignorance or unethical. But I don't blame people studying that because is 'not effective', unless, of course, they do so by deceivingly convincing taxpayers they're studying a good physical theory, but, again, that's a different kettle of fish.</p>

<p>Also, I avidly follow Woit's and Hossenfelder's blogs so I'm very much on their side of the discussion <span aria-label="laughing" class="emoji emoji-1f606" role="img" title="laughing">:laughing:</span></p>
