<p>This is the official topic for the course's second lecture, <strong>"Essential building blocks: Categories and Functors"</strong></p>
<p>As a reminder, by the end of this week you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand the key building blocks of categories: objects, morphisms and functors.</li>
<li>Leverage these concepts to explain several standard mathematical constructs: sets, relations, and groups.</li>
<li>Get comfortable manipulating these concepts through several worked exercises.</li>
<li>Ground all of the above in relevant deep learning context, with links to functional programming.</li>
<li>Show how we can build an effective "type checker" for deep learning using the category of sets.</li>
</ul>
<p>This lecture will help explain key parts of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15544">Graph Neural Networks are Dynamic Programmers</a> (Dudzik and Veličković, NeurIPS 2022)</p>

<p>Hi, I just wanted to mention that we've updated the calendar invite for this week with the new zoom link (you should be able to find it under 'Location' in the event). Alternatively, you should be able to access it from this link: <a href="https://uva-live.zoom.us/j/82982934369">Zoom link for Monday</a></p>

<p>Hi all, </p>
<p>Another important point to note: Lecture 2 will start <strong>at the same time</strong> as Lecture 1 (Monday, 17 October), but unlike Bruno's lecture, it will last <em>for up to <strong>two</strong> hours</em> (including Q&amp;A). Hence, the event will last <strong>4--6pm UK Time</strong>.</p>
<p>This is to give us ample time to play with many interesting categorical constructs in a paced manner. If you cannot make the whole slot, this is okay -- we will again strive to record. Of course, being there for the live event is preferable, as it will allow you to ask questions on the spot. <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span></p>

<p>Viliam Vadocz 05:09 PM  <br>
Why not use the zoom chat instead of the Q&amp;A?<br>
Pim de Haan 05:10 PM <br>
I think Q&amp;A is preferable. Allows for upvotes<br>
Karthikeyan Natesan Ramamurthy 05:18 PM  <br>
If we are not allowed to peek into the objects, how do we define useful morphisms?<br>
This question has been answered live<br>
Filip Bar 05:21 PM <br>
Of  course we  first have to be aware  of what our objects are to define meaningful morphisms (and that is the crux when d efining your category). Once you have that data settled down it is the morphisms that allow you to have the bird's  eye view on your global (and also local)  structure.<br>
Yivan Zhang 05:24 PM <br>
I think this is rooted in the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Yoneda+lemma">https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Yoneda+lemma</a><br>

does g circle f need to be unique?<br>

jules tsukahara 05:21 PM  <br>
If g and f are invertible, is it a category?<br>
This question has been answered live<br>
Filip Bar 05:24 PM <br>
Categories where every arrow is invertible is called a groupoid. As the name suggests it is a generalisation of a group, and has been around before  the concept of  a category has been defined.<br>
Giacomo Aldegheri 05:22 PM  <br>
Does category theory also deal with non-categories, or is the concept general enough to be “exhaustive”?<br>
This question has been answered live<br>
Filip Bar 05:22 PM <br>
Fun fact:  you can construct a category over any graph<br>
Tali Beynon 05:23 PM <br>
@Filip aka the free category generated by a quiver<br>
jules tsukahara 05:23 PM <br>
i guess you need to add all self loops and make all arrow composable?<br>
Pim de Haan 05:24 PM <br>
For example, a semigroup lacks an identity and itself can not be seen as a category. However, you can often still define morphisms between two semi-groups, so can form a category of all semigroups.<br>
Matthew Pugh 05:24 PM <br>
is every category a subcategory of the free category on some quiver?<br>
Tali Beynon 05:26 PM <br>
@Matthew yes, with some asterisks. for example you need to define "sub" to mean a quotient operation where you declare some morphisms to be identical to others, rather than a sub-graph.<br>
Tali Beynon 05:26 PM <br>
this is similar (in fact almost identical!) to how any finite group can be seen as isomorphic to a free group quotiented by some relations<br>
Filip Bar 05:27 PM <br>
Yes, it should be. You can forget the category structure and just look at it as a graph. Then you can construct the "free" category over that graph. This doesn't make your  original category a  subcategory. But you can perform a suitable "quotient construction" as Tali says.<br>
Matthew Pugh 05:28 PM <br>
So not as a subcategory but as a 'Quotient' Category by adding relations? Awesome, thanks for the help<br>
Tali Beynon 05:28 PM <br>
@Jules it's more that the morphisms of the free category represent <em>paths</em> of any finite length in the original graph. you can compose paths when they are head to tail. for example, the morphisms between objects 𝑎 and 𝑏 in the free category on a graph is the set of paths that begin at 𝑎 and end at 𝑏<br>
Tali Beynon 05:29 PM <br>
@Jules then the "empty path", which immediately starts and ends at a vertex 𝑎, is exactly the (unique) identity morphism in the category.<br>
Tali Beynon 05:30 PM <br>
@Jules I don't refer to category theory at all but the way it works is visualized here (<a href="https://quivergeometry.net/path-groupoids/">https://quivergeometry.net/path-groupoids/</a>) and its the same idea<br>

Dobrik Georgiev 05:29 PM  <br>
What does "up to isomorphism" mean in Cat theory? (i.e. what's an Isomorphism)<br>
João Araújo 05:29 PM <br>
Petar will explain that in a couple of slides<br>
Amina Mollaysa 05:29 PM  <br>
isn’t what is in the object makes A different from B? if we ignore what is in the object then everything in a set become the smae? like a molecular graph has different atoms because what is inside atoms actually defines what type of atom it is?<br>
João Araújo 05:34 PM <br>
In our context the sets themselves are the objects, what Petar is saying is that we won’t talk about the elements of the sets, but the sets themselves differ from each other by things like cardinality<br>
Filip Bar 05:36 PM <br>
Good point. This is  why we need to carefully distinguish between being isomorphic and being equal. Isomers in Chemistry would be isomorphic (in a suitable sense), but not equal.<br>
Tali Beynon 05:53 PM <br>
@Filip makes me think that a nice illustration of the maxim that "objects are defined by their relationships" for chemistry would be that nuclear isotopes manifest almost no chemical difference (except for slight changes in diffusion and reaction rates due to mass and maybe nuclear spin). so their chemical relationships with other molecules are the same, and we can treat them as the same kind of element "most of them time" because chemistry (=category theory) won't be able to tell the difference between them.<br>

Piotr Piękos 05:30 PM  <br>
could you give an example of a non-category that doesn’t satisfy the compositionality axiom?<br>
This question has been answered live<br>
Daniel Gonzalez Cedre 05:31 PM <br>
you can imagine a category with three objects A, B, C and two morphisms A-&gt;B and B-&gt;C and all of the identities, but no morphism A-&gt;C<br>
Sebastian Thomas (dida) 05:32 PM <br>
That’s kind of the „wrong“ question as composition is considered to be part of the data.<br>
Piotr Piękos 05:33 PM <br>
but isn’t it the case that you can always easily extend the universe of morphisms to contain the compositions?<br>
Daniel Gonzalez Cedre 05:34 PM <br>
sure, but then you may be dealing with a different universe. for example, if you are trying to describe some phenomenon using categorical language and you discover that compositionality is not satisfied, you can “add it in yourself,” but you have to acknowledge that the underlying phenomenon was not actually categorical<br>
Daniel Gonzalez Cedre 05:34 PM <br>
perhaps someone else can weigh in with such a real-world example, i can’t think of any at the moment<br>
Sebastian Thomas (dida) 05:35 PM <br>
Yes, you have the right intuition. Given a graph, you can „extend“ this graph and get a category. That construction is called the „free category“ on the given graph.</p>
<p>The true problem is that this free category becomes HUGE.<br>
Piotr Piękos 05:36 PM <br>
regardless of the real world example, i think i see it now more clearly, thanks. (If anyone has a non-trivial example, then I would still appreciate it)<br>
Filip Bar 05:38 PM <br>
@Piotr. Take as objects the points in space (say a torus = doughnuts), and the arrows to be be paths between the points. This does not form  a category unless you are very careful how you model continuous paths mathematically.<br>
Brayan Escobar 05:41 PM <br>
e.g. the graph of lovers, the objects are people, and a connection between A and B means "A fells attraction to B" or "A likes B"<br>
Shivam 05:31 PM  <br>
Descreibes ‘inside of B’ in a sense?<br>
This question has been answered live<br>
Andrei Manolache 05:32 PM  <br>
Don’t you still need to have some information about the set? In this case the cardinality?<br>
Pim de Haan 05:32 PM <br>
Just the set morphisms into and out of the object encode the cardinality.<br>
Andrei Manolache 05:37 PM <br>
I see, but we still need to know something about the (unique) morphisms, isn’t that equivalent to knowing the cardinality of the set?<br>

<p>In that figure, o is surjective; every output position is populated.  But some output positions are populated by two sources, so describing such a network requires a relation, also known as a "multi-valued function".</p>

<p>If you define exponentiability in a monoidal category, then taking the dual doesn't change the monoidal product.</p>
<p>But given the way things were defined in the lecture, it's appropriate to switch product to sum since it's defined by a universal property that gets reversed when we switch the arrows.  And in any case, for a cartesian product if we don't make the switch <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/cocartesian+closed+category">we're guaranteed to get something boring</a>.</p>

On the other hand, we can also formulate the definition based on statistical independence in the category of probability measures, where <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>P</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>X</mi><mo>×</mo><mi>Y</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">P(X \times Y)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">P</span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07847em;">X</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span><span class="mbin">×</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.22222em;">Y</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span> is all joint distributions and <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>P</mi><mi>X</mi><mo>×</mo><mi>P</mi><mi>Y</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">PX \times PY</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.7667em;vertical-align:-0.0833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07847em;">PX</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span><span class="mbin">×</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">P</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.22222em;">Y</span></span></span></span> is the product of two marginal distributions (disentangled). We can see that the concept of <em>product</em> is the core of disentanglement, and I think it is promising to unify these two definitions via CT. I'm currently working on this (sorry for the self-promotion: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02011">https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02011</a>), and an initial step is to go beyond groups because the invertibility requirement can be too restrictive in some problems. You can further check the concepts of the monoidal category and monoidal natural transformation, which can be useful here.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="551665">@Aishwarya Balwani</span> Thank you for the reference! I'm actually not aware of this work. It seems they considered more structures (Lie groups), but the core is still the product (product metric here?). One thing that bothered me for a while is that the community seems to divide into two groups, algebra-based and statistics-based, and we still lack a common ground where we can talk about both. I think CT may be the solution.<br>
I'm looking forward to chatting with you more, too!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>indeed, that's arguably the right the way to remember them. the candidates for morphisms in <em>any</em> category are "structure preserving maps", maps that preserve the structure of the objects in the category. when you apply this maxim to categories themselves, you get that a map between categories must "preserve morphism composition", since morphism composition is what defines the structure of a category. this property of preserving morphism composition, F(f) ; F(g) = F(f ; g) is indeed the (essential) defining property of a functor F. you can compose morphisms and apply functor, or apply functor and compose morphisms, and you get the same thing.</p>

I think the group structure is not essential in disentanglement and can be limiting. For example, the monoid of natural numbers for size and count is also useful. If we extend the definition in this direction, we can talk about more types of operations (I mentioned some ideas in the future work section). I'm glad that you find it interesting. Thanks!</p>

Case 1: <code>A</code> is non-empty. Then <code>v : B -&gt; Void + A</code>, so we need to map every element in <code>B</code> to an element in <code>A</code>.

<p>I don't like it because it is far from being as elegant as the exponential, because it doesn't seem very useful, and because of the arbitrary choice in the definition of <code>v</code>. Are we allowed to sweep this arbitrariness under the rug by saying that different choices lead to different definitions of the coexponential which are isomorphic to each other? If it was my choice of the object <code>coexp(B, A)</code> which was arbitrary, I would be fine with the idea that the different choices are isomorphic to each other, in the sense that we can find two morphisms between those two objects which compose to the identity. But what is the appropriate notion of isomorphism between two choices of definitions for <code>v</code>, which is itself a morphism?</p>

<p>In the GNN implementations we're referencing, o would send V^2 to V by summing along one axis, and V^2 to V^2 by the identity.  So every element of V^2 is sent by o to two values.  The point is that the tensor is copied and then used in two different ways.</p>

<p>Hi guys. I am still trying to get my head around products and coproducts. I asked a question in QnA but I didn't understand the answers. If I understand correctly then the projections have to be epimorphism. For the Set category I can see it. But is it true in general? I tried to prove it but didn't get too far. Any explanation or link to further resources will be much appreciated. I also have another question related to this. How do we prove that two morphisms are same, in general? If we can show that for all f_1 we have f_1<em>g=f_1</em>h and for all f2 we have g<em>f_2=h</em>f2 then can we say g=h?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Well, yes, but not for a very good reason. It suffices to consider the case <code>f_1 = id</code>, because in that case <code>f_1∘g = f_1∘h</code> implies <code>g = h</code>, because <code>g = id∘g = id∘h = h</code>. So you're proving a lot more than you need to :)</p>
<p>For a specific category, you need to rely on the definition of morphisms for that category, e.g. for Set, it's extensional equality. For an abstract category ℂ, you have to rely on some information you have already been given about the category, e.g. if you know that it has a terminal object <code>1</code> and you have two morphisms <code>f : A -&gt; 1</code> and <code>g : A -&gt; 1</code>, then you know that <code>f = g</code> because the definition of a terminal object says that there is a <em>unique</em> morphism from <code>A</code> to <code>1</code>.</p>

<p>Hi guys. I am still trying to get my head around products and coproducts. I asked a question in QnA but I didn't understand the answers. If I understand correctly then the projections have to be epimorphism. For the Set category I can see it. But is it true in general? I tried to prove it but didn't get too far. Any explanation or link to further resources will be much appreciated. I also have another question related to this. How do we prove that two morphisms are same, in general? If we can show that for all f_1 we have f_1<em>g=f_1</em>h and for all f2 we have g<em>f_2=h</em>f2 then can we say g=h?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The projections aren't always epimorphisms, even in Set. (take one set to be empty) In general, we can expect this to fail any time a product with a non-initial object equals the initial object.  One example where this happens a lot is the category of affine schemes. (defined to be the opposite of the category of commutative rings)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="554091">@Alexey Uvarov</span>, thanks for asking! The tile function is something like <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.repeat.html#numpy.repeat">https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.repeat.html#numpy.repeat</a>.<br>
It repeats (broadcasts) an array along a new axis, a certain number of times. The snd / rcv are arguments coming from the sender / receiver nodes, respectively, by either broadcasting along axis 0 or axis 1.</p>

<p>I notice I’m still slightly confused about the claim that “o is no longer a function” — I intuitively see what’s going on, but why is the claim not “o is no longer an epimorphism”? (A possibly useful question to clarify things: what is the type of o in Haskell?)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In that figure, o is surjective; every output position is populated.  But some output positions are populated by two sources, so describing such a network requires a relation, also known as a "multi-valued function".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm slightly confused here. While I do understand why surjectivity implies o is not function, why is o a surjection to begin with?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the GNN implementations we're referencing, o would send V^2 to V by summing along one axis, and V^2 to V^2 by the identity.  So every element of V^2 is sent by o to two values.  The point is that the tensor is copied and then used in two different ways.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the clarification that really helped! It seems like I mistook the indexed union as a cartesian product when I was thinking.</p>

<p>Still struggling way back at the idea of the unit set.<br>
There is exactly one morphism from set A into unit set, which comprises one function mapping each element into the unit set, right ? But if any more than one of those mappings is applied, then isn’t it no longer reaching the unit set, because then the cardinality of the range would be greater than one ?<br>
Forgive the stupid question.</p>

There is exactly one morphism from set A into unit set, which comprises one function mapping each element into the unit set, right ? But if any more than one of those mappings is applied, then isn’t it no longer reaching the unit set, because then the cardinality of the range would be greater than one ?<br>
Forgive the stupid question.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, let's say you start with a set A with 3 elements A, B and C, and you have a function <code>f</code> which "maps each element into the unit set". Are you saying that after calling <code>f(A)</code>, the set A now has 2 elements B and C while the unit set has one element A? And if you then call <code>f(B)</code>, the set A now only has one element C while the unit set now has two elements A and B?</p>
<p>If so, please take a deep breath, because you're going to have to relearn everything you know about functions and sets! In a programming language, there are indeed data structures called "sets" to which we can add and remove elements, and there are procedures called "functions" which, when called, can add and remove elements from sets, and perform many more things. However, in math (and in functional programming), sets are <em>immutable</em>, and functions are <em>pure</em>. This means that a set's contents never changes, and that calling a function has no side effects whatsoever, so you don't have to worry about how many times the functions are called and in which order, you only have to understand what the function returns given a particular input.</p>
<p>So when we say that <code>f</code> "maps each elements into the unit set", we are definitely <em>not</em> saying that calling <code>f</code> has the side effect of removing an element from the set A and adding it to the unit set. If the set A has 3 elements, it has always had 3 elements and will always have. The unit set has and always will have one element. Let's call this element "X". Calling <code>f(A)</code> does not perform any side-effect, it just returns <code>X</code>. Calling <code>f(B)</code> also returns <code>X</code>. And so does calling <code>f(C)</code>.</p>
<p>Does that help? My apologies if I have completely misunderstood the nature of your confusion.</p>

<p>Hi Samuel,<br>
I think you have opened up a whole new area for me.<br>
Yes that was my misunderstanding, and you have explained it very clearly. Thank you so much for taking the time. <br>
I already think this course is wonderful for opening up a community of interested people to discuss basic misunderstandings with . I was also impressed with how Petar introduced category theory with specific results like this one , only after the basic definition. I had grown used to following other category theory introductions which moved through the same routine examples  - and this approach has shaken me out of complacency.</p>

<p>The categories\functors lecture was a great refresher for me. <br>
Amusingly, I found myself more confused by the GNN\message-passing part although ML theory is my main area of research (though I have no experience with neither GNNs or message-passing).<br>
Is this going to be critical for understanding the next lectures? If so, are there any good sources that can help me close the gap?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Thanks for raising this <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="553383">@Gal K</span> and for your very kind comments on the lecture!</p>
<p>I don't think it will be critical. Though it will be helpful for <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="281702">@Pim de Haan</span> 's and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="553308">@Andrew Dudzik</span>'s lectures, which will talk about GNNs also.</p>
<p>I recommend checking this lecture from me: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF53xsT7mjc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uF53xsT7mjc</a><br>
to get a better feel for GNNs, message passing, and the underlying principles (e.g. permutation equivariance) and perspectives (e.g. graph signal processing, NLP, PGMs...). Hope it helps!</p>
