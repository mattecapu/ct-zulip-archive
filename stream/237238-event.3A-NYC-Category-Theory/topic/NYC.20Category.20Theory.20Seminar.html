<p>Title:     On Chaitin's two HP's: (1) Heuristic Principle and (2) Halting Probability.</p>
<p>Abstract: Two important achievements of Chaitin will be investigated: the Omega number, which is claimed to be the halting probability of input-free programs, and the heuristic principle, which is claimed to hold for program-size complexity. Chaitin's heuristic principle says that the theories cannot prove the heavier sentences; the sentences and the theories were supposedly weighed by various computational complexities, which all turned out to be wrong or incomplete. In this talk, we will introduce a weighting that is not based on any computational complexity but on the provability power of the theories, for which Chaitin's heuristic principle holds true. Also, we will show that the Omega number is not equal to the halting probability of the input-free programs and will suggest some methods for calculating this probability, if any.</p>

<p>Title:     Hom sweet Hom: a sketch of the history of duality in category theory.</p>
<p>Abstract: Duality, in its various forms and roles, played a surprisingly important part in the development of category theory. In this talk, I will concentrate on the development of these forms and roles that lead to the categorical formulation of Stone-type dualities in the 1970s. I will emphasize the epistemological gain and loss along the way.</p>

<p>Title:     Fibred Categories in Lean.</p>
<p>Abstract: Fibred categories are one of the most important and useful concepts in category theory and its application in categorical logic. In this talk I present my recent formalization of fired categories in the interactive theorem prover Lean 4. I begin by highlighting certain technical challenges associated with handling the equality of objects and functors within the extensional dependent type system of Lean, and how they can be overcome. In this direction, I will demonstrate how we can take advantage of dependent coercion, instance synthesis, and automation tactics from of the Lean toolbox. Finally I will discuss a formalization of Homotopy Type Theory in Lean 4 using a fired categorical framework.</p>

<p>·  Title:  Pulse Diagrams and Category Theory.</p>
<p>·  Abstract: ``Pulse diagrams'' are motivated by the ubiquity of pulsation in biology, from action potentials, to heartbeat, to respiration, and at longer time-scales to circadian rhythms and even to human behavior. The syntax of the diagrams is simple, and the semantics are easy to define and simulate with Python code. They express behaviors of parts and wholes as in categorical mereology, but are missing a compositional framework, like string diagrams. Examples to discuss include cellular automata, leaky-integrate-and-fire neurons, harmonic frequency generation, Gillespie algorithm for the chemical master equation, piecewise-linear genetic regulatory networks, Lotka-Volterra systems, and if time permits, aspects of the adaptive immune system. The talk is more about questions than about answers.</p>

<li>Title:     <strong>Canonical squares in fully faithful and absolutely dense equipments.</strong></li>
<li>Abstract: Equipments are categorical structures of dimension 2 having two separate types of 1-arrows -vertical and horizontal- and supporting restriction and extension of horizontal arrows along vertical ones. Equipments were defined by Wood in [W] as 2-functors satisfying certain conditions, but can also be understood as double categories satisfying a fibrancy condition as in [Sh]. In the zoo of 2-dimensional categorical structures, equipments nicely fit in between 2-categories and double categories, and are generally considered as the 2-dimensional categorical structures where synthetic category theory is done, and in some cases, where monoidal bicategories are more naturally defined.<br>
  In a previous talk in the seminar, I discussed the problem of lifting a 2-category into a double category along a given category of vertical arrows, and how this problem allows us to define a notion of length on double categories. The length of a double category is a number that roughly measures the amount of work one needs to do to reconstruct the double category from a bicategory along its set of vertical arrows.<br>
  In this talk I will review the length of double categories, and I will discuss two recent developments in the theory: In the paper [OM] a method for constructing different double categories from a given bicategory is presented. I will explain how this construction works. One of the main ingredients of the construction are so-called canonical squares. In the preprint [O] it is proven that in certain classes of equipments -fully faithful and absolutely dense- every square that can be canonical is indeed canonical. I will explain how from this, it can be concluded that fully faithful and absolutely dense equipments are of length 1, and so they can be 'easily' reconstructed from their horizontal bicategories.<br>

<li>Title:     <strong>Uniqueness of Classical Retrodiction.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Abstract: In previous talks at this Category seminar and at the Topology, Geometry and Physics seminar, Arthur Parzygnat showed how Bayesian inversion and its generalization to quantum mechanics may be interpreted as a functor on a suitable category of states which satisfies certain axioms. Such a functor is called a retrodiction and Parzygnat and collaborators conjectured that retrodiction is unique. In this talk, I will present a proof of this conjecture for the special case of classical probability theory on finite state spaces.</p>
<p>In this special case, the category in question has non-degenerate probability distributions on finite sets as its objects and stochastic matrices as its morphisms. After preliminary definitions and lemmas, the proof proceeds in three main steps.</p>
<p>In the first step, we focus on certain groups of automorphisms of certain objects. As a consequence of the axioms, it follows that these groups are preserved under any retrodiction functor and that the restriction of the functor to such a group is a certain kind of group automorphism. Since this group is isomorphic to a Lie group, it is easy to prove that the restriction of a retrodiction to such a group must equal Bayesian inversion if we assume continuity. If we do not make that assumption, we need to work harder and derive continuity "from scratch" starting from the positivity condition in the definition of stochastic matrix.</p>
<p>In the second step, we broaden our attention to the full automorphism groups of objects of our category corresponding to uniform distributions. We show that these groups are generated by the union of the subgroup consisting of permutation matrices and the subgroup considered in the first step. From this fact, it follows that the restriction of a retrodiction to this larger group must equal Bayesian inversion.</p>
<p>In the third step, we finally consider all the objects and morphisms of our category. As a consequence of what we have shown in the first two steps and some preliminary lemmas, it follows that retrodiction is given by matrix conjugation. Furthermore, Bayesian inversion is the special case where the conjugating matrices are diagonal matrices. Because the hom sets of our category are convex polytopes and a retrodiction functor is a continuous bijection of such sets, a retodiction must map polytope faces to faces. By an algebraic argument, this fact implies that the conjugating matrices are diagonal, answering the conjecture in the affirmative.</p>
