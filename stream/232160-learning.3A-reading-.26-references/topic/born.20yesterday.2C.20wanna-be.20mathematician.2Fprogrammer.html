<p>hi all,<br>
i'm a bookworm, want to say autodidact but i learn from the authors. anyways, i have a lack of guides (more knowledgeable people than myself telling me what to do) and am here putting myself out there and calling for help/guidance from more experienced folk. suggestions for math subjects/books would be wonderful.</p>
<p>self-image: <br>
recently mind-blown by math. don't know much, but i know that category theory and logic is where i want to start.</p>
<p>long term goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>be able to make mathematical models of problems in daily life</li>
<li>solve optimization problems in such models</li>
<li>(insignificant detail?:) be able to learn math and write proofs using Lean (CIC in DTT)</li>
<li>become a great coder in Lean and be able to assess the efficiency of any code, be able to model and understand any programming language or code</li>
</ul>
<p>short term goals: to learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>math logic (more specifically, categorical logic) and computation, complexity, proof theory</li>
<li>computer science and applying algebra to learn combinatorics, other applications</li>
</ul>
<p>material i've covered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paolo Perrone's Starting Category Theory (2024)</li>
<li>part of Niles Johnson and Donald Yau's 2-Dimensional Categories (2021) </li>
</ul>
<p>material i'm learning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clive Newstead's thesis: Algebraic models of dependent type theory (2018) </li>
<li>Noson Yanofsky's Theoretical Computer Science for the Working Category Theorist (2022)<br>
for the above i'm using other papers and Niles Johnson and Donald Yau's 2-Dimensional Categories (2021) as a reference or as needed</li>
</ul>
<p>material i'd like to learn once i'm ready:</p>
<ul>
<li>Olivia Caramello's Theories, Sites, Toposes (2018)</li>
<li>
<p>Jacob Lurie's Higher Topos Theory (2009)<br>
for the above i'd like to learn requisite math subjects such as linear algebra, abstract algebra, algebraic topology via category theory for example</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>linear algebra and abstract algebra by studying the associated bicategories or tricategories or operads using Niles Johnson's and Donald Yau's books</p>
</li>
<li>topology via Monoidal Topology (2014) by Robert Lowen, Walter Tholen, Gavin Seal, Dirk Hofmann, Rory Lucyshyn-Wright, Manrian Clementino, Eva Colebunders</li>
</ul>
<p>any pointers or resource suggestions appreciated, thanks!</p>

<p>thanks for your recommendations, yes i should read those, i'll add these to my list!  <br>
also Paolo Perrone's book did recommend Riehl's and Fong and Spivak's book as a continuation. <br>
i am planning on learning physics eventually too  and your page is a goldmine for book recommendations! <br>
i'm surprised you're so active on this zulip and yet category theory represents such a small percentage of the book recommendations on your page. <br>
btw just fyi the first 2 links are broken on this line: "...available free online at <a href="http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/teaching/sp18/7Sketches.pdf">http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/teaching/sp18/7Sketches.pdf</a>. Also see their [website with videos] and my [lectures]."<br>
i've seen you referenced quite a bit in some literature btw!</p>

<p>I don't think it's actually necessary to learn calculus or linear algebra before learning set theory, logic, real analysis, or abstract algebra. </p>
<p>Calculus and linear algebra are usually taught before the other subjects in university because they are useful for physicists and engineers and many other people, and so the university usually makes it a graduation requirement for all its students and a prerequisite for the rest of its maths. </p>
<p>But one can simply jump right in to set theory and logic from the end of the basic school maths curriculum since none of the subject actually requires calculus or linear algebra. Actually in some curricula around the world the basics of set theory is taught prior to the real numbers and elementary algebra.</p>
<p>One can think of the subjects of set theory, logic, number theory, the ring theory part of abstract algebra, real analysis, and some basic complex analysis as simply formalising and abstracting the school maths curriculum up to algebra and trigonometry.</p>

<p>I certainly don't think it's necessary to study calculus or linear algebra before set theory, logic, or abstract algebra.  I hope my page didn't say it was necessary.  I think I said it was traditional.</p>
<p>I do think it's bad to study real analysis before calculus: e.g. studying measure theory before you've ever done an integral seems difficult to me, because you couldn't do the calculations that provide examples and counterexamples.   </p>
<p>(Personally I think many important theorems in real analysis, like the Dominated Convergence Theorem, only become really interesting when you use them for something, e.g. Fourier analysis, which in turn only becomes interesting when you use <em>that</em> for something, e.g. solving PDE, which in turn only becomes interesting when you use <em>those</em> for something, e.g. understanding the physical world.   Other people may have more ability to get interested in self-contained mathematical subjects, so I don't want to project my taste on everyone else.  But I only became passionate about real analysis because I saw how it was used to understand light, heat, gravity and so on.  And this is indeed a major reason it was developed.  So for me, personally, I found a mixed curriculum of logic, math and physics to be very satisfying.  I think some pure mathematicians find ODE and PDE boring because they aren't using these equations to understand something.)</p>

<p>I wasn't thinking about measure theory or some of the more advanced topics in real analysis, but rather basic stuff like formally constructing the real numbers (i.e. using Dedekind cuts, Cauchy filters, etc) and proving theorems about the real numbers (like its complete Archimedean ordered field structure); similarly formally constructing and proving theorems about transcendental functions like the exponential, logarithm, and trigonometric functions, as well as other stuff taught in algebra like the fundamental theorem of algebra. This would all lie in the realm of real analysis, and would be approachable by somebody straight out of secondary or high school who has some knowledge of set theory and logic.</p>
<p>The key here, like the case for elementary number theory, wouldn't be learning new facts about the real numbers and real-valued functions, but constructing and proving in a rigourous way the structures and theorems you had already learned previously.</p>

<p>Sure, that could be fine, for someone who has an interest in understanding what the real numbers are "really all about".</p>

<p>Yes, Madeleine’s description fits something more like Spivak’s Calculus, which treats both calculus and basic real analysis together. This is nice since indeed many people’s first real analysis course is just a retread of their calculus I course, with proofs this time, which can be boring.</p>

<p>Well, most people's first number theory course is a retread of what they had already learned about the natural numbers, the integers, and rational numbers in their schooling before university, only this time with formal definitions and rigourous proofs. </p>
<p>Compare that with something like elliptic curves or modular forms which are commonly used in more advanced number theory, but won't be taught in people's first number theory class.</p>

<p>I do have to say that I am somewhat biased by my background, since the real analysis I've studied and worked with is constructive real analysis. There is a strong connection between logic and real analysis and one can write multiple books on the various axioms one can assume in constructive mathematics, such as LPO or Brouwer's continuity principle, and the impact that would have on the properties of the real numbers and real-valued functions, such as the Heine-Borel theorem, the Bolsano-Weierstrass theorem, and the intermediate value theorem. There is also a lot of emphasis on computations and infinite digit representations in constructive real analysis and how those are affected under the various axioms, especially Markov's principle. </p>
<p>I guess from the perspective of classical mathematics this is all just reverse mathematics and thus a branch of mathematical logic rather than real analysis.</p>

<p>Yes, and I never heard about the use of constructive reasoning when taking a year-long course called "real analysis" as an undergrad.

<p>I guess something similar happened with set theory - where if you take set theory from a university most of the time it will be ZFC or a similar theory using a single membership relation <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>∈</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\in</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.5782em;vertical-align:-0.0391em;"></span><span class="mrel">∈</span></span></span></span>, whereas the first set theory I learned was ETCS and the second theory of sets I learned was dependent type theory with axiom K to make every single type in the theory a set. </p>
<p>As well as topology - the topology taught in universities is point-set topology rather than point-free approaches such as locales or formal topologies.</p>

<p>I don't think it's actually necessary to learn calculus or linear algebra before learning set theory, logic, real analysis, or abstract algebra. </p>
<p>Calculus and linear algebra are usually taught before the other subjects in university because they are useful for physicists and engineers and many other people, and so the university usually makes it a graduation requirement for all its students and a prerequisite for the rest of its maths. </p>
<p>But one can simply jump right in to set theory and logic from the end of the basic school maths curriculum since none of the subject actually requires calculus or linear algebra. Actually in some curricula around the world the basics of set theory is taught prior to the real numbers and elementary algebra.</p>
<p>One can think of the subjects of set theory, logic, number theory, the ring theory part of abstract algebra, real analysis, and some basic complex analysis as simply formalising and abstracting the school maths curriculum up to algebra and trigonometry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>yea i agree it's not necessary to learn in the traditional order, for example linear algebra first, then abstract algebra, then homological algebra and category theory. most linear algebra books teach how matrix multiplication works and have students follow the algorithms like robots whereas i liked how Birkhoff and Mac Lane's explanation made it more interesting from the get-go by showing matrix multiplication as a morphism between biproducts (products coinciding with coproducts) in a category of modules. i think it makes more sense to start with category theory. since you mentioned logic, i think the unity of math is very nice and i think it has logic at it's core. i now understand why the math majors and computer science majors are bundled together at a lot of universities, is because logic and computer science is where math really starts.</p>
<p>i agree with John Baez's point that theorems become really interesting (and i would say study motivation is generated) only when you know you're about to use them for some application or further learning closer to your interests that depends on it.</p>
<p>i like category theory because (i'm just a noobie, correct me if i'm wrong, but seems to me that) if you think of math subjects as landscapes, category theory's general approach is to occupy the mountain peak and have a good perspective.</p>
<p>for example, i wanted to learn algebra (needed for understanding a topology text for example) reading Birkhoff and Mac Lane's Algebra (1967-99) and Aluffi's Algebra: Chapter 0 (2009-16) and Anderson and Fuller's Rings and Categories of Modules (1974-92) (which I was happy to see on your page you mentioned, John Baez!), all of which are exceptional books in the fact that they teach using a categorical approach and are often mentioned to people on q&amp;a sites looking for such books. </p>
<p>i'm glad i just stuck with learning categorical algebra, reading Niles Johnson and Donald Yau's 2-Dimensional Categories (2021) and was blown away by the 'small asides' of first, Example 2.1.26 (that there's a bicategory Bimod, objects: rings, 1-cells R -&gt; S: bimodules <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mrow></mrow><mi>R</mi></msub><msub><mi>M</mi><mi>S</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex"> _{R}M_{S} </annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8333em;vertical-align:-0.15em;"></span><span class="mord"><span></span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.3283em;"><span style="top:-2.55em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mathnormal mtight" style="margin-right:0.00773em;">R</span></span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.15em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.10903em;">M</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.3283em;"><span style="top:-2.55em;margin-left:-0.109em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mathnormal mtight" style="margin-right:0.05764em;">S</span></span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.15em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> ,...), and second Section 6.3 (i say 'aside' because: "This section describes several basic examples of duality in algebra as adjunctions in the bicategory Bimod. The results in this section are not used elsewhere in this book" pg. 256). Like that's how I want to learn linear algebra! The older books above do not mention bicategories, or a monad or monoidal category either for that matter.</p>

<p>haha very cool way to put it. <br>
what would you recommend as a good introduction to philosophy which explains such things as category mistakes or that you've found to be great reads? </p>
<p>i saw that Awodey agreed with a quote of you: <br>
"I would say -- and I think Steve and Andrej would agree -- that the HoTT notion of propositional truncation is the "modern successor" of Propositions As [Types]. IIRC the rules in that paper aren't quite right in the intensional / higher-categorical case, but now in HoTT we have the correct rules and a general justification." </p>
<p>i'm interested in the understanding you have of foundational systems (ZFC, ETCS, DTT). <br>
i understand the idea of propositions as types, <br>
i've studied Avigad's Mathematical Logic and Computation (but the end of the book seemed like he was only just getting started and not sure exactly where to go from there),<br>
but other than that the quote goes over my head.<br>
for example, what is the IIRC paper? i'd like to learn the intensional / higher-categorical case.<br>
what do you recommend as next books so that i might learn these correct rules?</p>
<p>i've seen <a href="https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/">https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/</a> recommended and was planning on reading it at some point but i've been reading Clive Newstead's thesis: Algebraic models of dependent type theory (2018) to get an idea of that.<br>
i'd like to be able to understand the difficulties in proving some conjectures in a paper that came out this year by Mario Carneiro <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14064">arXiv:2403.14064v1</a></p>

<p>I'm not a good person to recommend philosophy books.  The paper I was referring to in that quote is the one called "Propositions as [Types]".  I think the HoTT Book is a good introduction to propositional truncation in the homotopical type theory case, although Egbert Rijke's book "Introduction to homotopy type theory" is also good.</p>

<p>I'm afraid I won't be able to help you here. While I am familiar with dependent type theory, I am not all that familiar with either the metatheory of dependent type theory, or the Lean project, or formal verification of programming languages. However, the author Mario Carneiro is on the Lean Zulipchat, so you might be able to ask him there what he thinks are the prerequisites to understanding his paper.</p>

<p>This is because most linear algebra books and most linear algebra courses at universities are geared towards physicists and engineers and computer scientists where the goal is to teach them to use these algorithms in helping them construct various models and solve various problems in their domain, not necessarily to help them understand the properties of vector spaces/modules and linear maps in a deeper level. </p>
<p>There is usually a separate course called "abstract linear algebra" or something similar at universities which is aimed at mathematicians and does go more deeply into the theory of vector spaces and modules and linear maps between vector spaces.</p>

<p>Yeah, the math majors at my university have to take a course on linear algebra that's not just mindless matrix manipulation.  You can see that <a href="https://mathdept.ucr.edu/sites/g/files/rcwecm1516/files/2019-11/m131.pdf">part 1</a> of this course covers the concepts of vector space, linear map, dimension, isomorphism, basis, subspace, quotient space and dual space.</p>
<p>Then <a href="https://mathdept.ucr.edu/sites/g/files/rcwecm1516/files/2019-11/m132.pdf">part 2</a> covers eigenvectors, Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization, projections, change of basis for matrices, determinants, diagonalization, and Jordan normal form.</p>
<p>This is different from the <a href="https://mathdept.ucr.edu/sites/g/files/rcwecm1516/files/2019-11/m031_2018.pdf">applied linear algebra course</a>.</p>

<p>Part 1 is a decent warmup to the theory of modules over rings that you'd learn in abstract algebra, though it exploits all the simplications of working over a field.   Part 2 involves the inner product more, so part of it is a warmup for studying Hilbert spaces.</p>

<p>Something I do not get about universities and American universities in particular is why they teach calculus with multiple variables before linear algebra.

<p>So much of a typical elementary multivariable calculus class is really just 2- and 3-variable calculus - div, grad, curl, Gauss' theorem, Stokes' theorem - in short, the stuff that people need to understand Maxwell's equations - that I believe universities prefer not to force their physicists and engineers to have studied linear algebra first, before they can study electromagnetism.   Every prerequisite costs time, and the physics and engineering departments would complain bitterly if they were increased.  They're always threatening to teach their own math courses - a threat that math departments are constantly guarding against.</p>

<p>Kind of a funny story, at my undergrad college a professor dropped a multi variable course so a grad student was asked to cover it. The grad student said they would, under the condition they were allowed to teach differential forms.</p>
<p>Their thought process was that it'll be fine provided he simply explains the calculations like any other applied course.</p>
<p>The students complained their professors wouldn't be able to grade their homework, and that the methods were incongruous with their physics notes and textbooks. But, the grad student was so passionate about differential forms, <em>they offered to grade all of their physics homework if the physics professors couldn't or wouldn't</em>.</p>

<p>forgive my exaggeration. i like how Mike above said category theory is about organization. my opinion is that  category theory should be taught before linear algebra because it's more useful regardless, as Fong and Spivak's book (which i have not yet read) i assume shows, and that one should not wait to give a breakdown from the abstract to the particular when teaching math. seems current curricula have their students blindfolded to the larger structure. they could have studied those courses knowing bicategories and tricategories beforehand, and gotten much more out of it, seems to me, but idk.</p>

<p>I disagree, it is better to begin with more specific examples and then generalise to the abstract case. For example, in ring theory, we give various examples of rings out there, such as integers, real numbers, polynomial algebras, matrix algebras, Clifford algebras, integers modulo a natural number, etc, so that people have some intuition of what a ring could be. Then we abstract away from all that and define rings. </p>
<p>It's the same with category theory. One would study set theory and Cartesian products, disjoint unions, and function sets, then one would study abelian group theory and direct sums, direct products, and tensor products of abelian groups and the abelian group of homomorphisms, then one would study linear algebra and direct sums, direct product, tensor product of vector spaces and the vector spaces of linear maps, and then one would study topological spaces and product topological spaces, disjoint union topological spaces, and function spaces. Finally, one has enough examples to then say okay in general categories these are products and coproducts and tensor products and internal homs/exponential objects, so that people can understand why these concepts in categories are so important.</p>

<p>One can teach subjects in a categorical manner, defining direct sums of abelian groups or product topological spaces in terms of its universal properties and then using the universal properties to prove theorems in the subject, without ever mentioning the word "category".

<p>There is also the issue that courses on category theory usually also teach about functors, which I do not really feel is all that useful in many areas of mathematics until one gets to much more advanced topics in that field, such as homological algebra, condensed mathematics in complex and functional analysis, or sheaves in algebraic and differential geometry.</p>

<p>Yeah, one good feature of number theory as a first "intro to proofs" course is that in number theory there are a lot of statements that are easy to understand yet surprising, which therefore seem to require proof.    I've taught a quarter-long course of that sort twice, which went up to quadratic reciprocity.  I found the proof of quadratic reciprocity in the book to be too long and complicated to be fun.   (There are nicer proofs that use Fourier theory, but I couldn't really get into that.)  If I taught the course again I'd stick to more "bite-sized" theorems.</p>

<p>When I taught it (once, at SUNY Brockport, a very modest institution), I got up to the two squares theorem, that primes congruent to 1 mod 4 are sums of two squares. This involves the arithmetic of Gaussian integers, for which there is a division lemma (or whatever it's called: the statement that <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="double-struck">Z</mi><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><mi>i</mi><mo stretchy="false">]</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{Z}[i]</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathbb">Z</span><span class="mopen">[</span><span class="mord mathnormal">i</span><span class="mclose">]</span></span></span></span> is a <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Euclidean%20domain">[[Euclidean domain]]</a>). This has some pleasant geometry underling it. </p>

<p>There's a beautiful "structural" proof of <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/quadratic%20reciprocity">[[quadratic reciprocity]]</a>, ascribed to Zolotarev and more or less explained by Conway and Fung in The Sensual (Quadratic) Form, but which unlike Fourier theory (i.e., Gauss sum) type proofs, hasn't suggested further deep number-theoretic extensions along class field theory lines.

<p>Sorry about the poor etiquette from me like no caps, I haven't presented myself very professionally, and I appreciate getting feedback from professionals.</p>
<p>The feedback unanimously seems to be that I should learn math more or less as a university would teach it, other than some exceptions mentioned, such as the multi-variable calculus before linear algebra.</p>

<p>@Madeleine Birchfield Where did you learn these subjects/approaches from? For ETCS I'm only aware of <a href="https://github.com/mattearnshaw/lawvere/blob/master/pdfs/2005-an-elementary-theory-of-the-category-of-sets-with-commentary.pdf">this</a> source to learn from, and I've seen The point of pointless topology(1983) by Peter T. Johnstone cited.</p>
<p>@John Baez I saw the first part of the talk you gave at the Oktoberfest and found the discussion very interesting.  I've been reading From Groups to Categorical Algebra by Dominique Bourne to learn about the simpler of the categories you mentioned such as linear categories and plan to learn about symmetric rig categories once I get the basics down! </p>
<p>I had some observations that I was hoping to get help putting into place where they stand in relation to one another:</p>
<ol>
<li>Theory in the vicinity of operads and generalized PROPs seems to have to do with classifying algebras. The contents of A Foundation for PROPs, Algebras, and Modules by Donald Yau and Mark W. Johnson seems to be an extensive and relatively all-encompassing way of classifying algebras.</li>
<li>Universal algebra seems to be a way of classifying algebras and using model theory for applications in algebra, from what I read of the forward by F. W. Lawvere of Algebraic Theories by Adámek, Rosický and Vitale.</li>
<li>Topos theory seems to always be mentioned in connection with logic, and in your Oktoberfest talk you mentioned topos theory is essentially the algebraic theory of rigs with products distributing over coproducts. I've seen 'algebraic theories' and signatures mentioned in this subject, so this is also about using model theory.</li>
<li>I've also heard about Quillen model categories being used. Are they also used in studying algebra? This paper: Cartesian double theories: A double-categorical framework for categorical doctrines by Michael Lambert, Evan Patterson</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm also interested in logic and model theory, which is why I'd like to study logic in connection with algebra eventually, and why I'd like an understanding of where the subjects lie in relation to each other, and the order they should be studied in.</p>
<p>Putting down category theory and instead looking for an overview of math subjects I looked at the contents of Mathematical Concepts by Jürgen Jost which seems to have taken me in a circle as I saw that the last chapter is on topos theory.</p>

<p>I think a good approach is to learn some of whatever your heart desires, while in parallel making sure you master the usual university courses expected of math majors, so that at end you can talk to mathematicians and be accepted by them (which is extremely morale-boosting and fun) while still having your own unique style.   That's more or less what I did.   And it sounds like that's what you're aiming to do.</p>

<p>This is all roughly correct; let me just say some stuff....</p>
<p>When I hear "<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/model-theory/">model theory</a>" I think of hard-core classical logic and set theory, which is quite different in flavor from universal algebra.  In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_algebra#Basic_idea">universal algebra</a> you greatly limit the expressive power of your logic, in order to get more powerful results about the structures you can still describe.  (This is always the tradeoff.)  Basically, in universal algebra you only describe structures that have a bunch of operations obeying equational laws: this leaves out a lot of math, but covers groups and rings and lots of other "algebraic" things.</p>
<p>The category theorist's approach to universal algebra involves Lawvere theories and algebraic theories.   There's also a more old-fashioned approach due to Birkhoff, which is also worth learning.</p>
<p>Operads and props are similar enough to Lawvere theories that in the long run you'll see them as different parts of a spectrum.</p>

<p>I hope I said that topoi are nice <em>examples</em> of rig categories where the multiplication is given by products, the addition is given coproducts, and the products distribute over the coproducts.  There are also lots of such rig categories that <em>aren't</em> topoi.    And it doesn't even parse to say "topos theory is the algebraic theory of rigs with products distributing over coproducts" - there are 2 separate ways this sentence fails to parse.</p>

<p>I think you're talking about too many big ideas at once here for me to say anything truly helpful about any one of them.   Each one takes quite a while to explain.  I'm almost glad I grew up before the internet, so that I didn't meet so many big ideas at the same time!   Especially before I went to college, books were precious and I would tend to get to know them very well, one at a time.  Nowadays everyone has to work harder to keep from getting hopelessly distracted by the endless sea of links.  Props, operads, Lavwere theories, algebraic theories, model categories, topoi.... <em>aargh!</em></p>

<p>As for point-free topology, I learned it piecemeal by reading research papers in that field, such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00678">Generalized spaces for constructive algebra</a> by Ingo Blechschmidt or <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00678">Uniform locales and their constructive aspects</a> by Graham Manuell, and then taking a look at the references inside the articles for more information. </p>
<p>More generally, reading new research papers, usually preprints on the arXiv, is how I learned a lot of the mathematics I know. I tend not to read textbooks or old papers from 50 years ago, since the material usually aren't available to those outside university unless they are willing to fork over a lot of money to publishers and journals. People inside universities usually have free journal subscriptions through their institution and textbooks in their university libraries.</p>
<p>Also the nLab has a good repository of information on mathematics, though some of the stuff on the nLab is incorrect so beware.</p>

<p>A lot of important math monographs and textbooks are available for free electronically from LibGen.    I often find it easier to systematically learn stuff by repeatedly reading books rather than reading papers - first skimming, then digging deeper.   But I also spend a lot of time mining the arXiv, and Wikipedia, and the nLab.</p>
