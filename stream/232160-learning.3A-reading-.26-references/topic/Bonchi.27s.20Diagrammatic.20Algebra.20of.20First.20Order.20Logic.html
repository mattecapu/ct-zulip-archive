<p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>I just recently finished watching Filippo Bonchi's Topos Institute Colloquium talk, "Diagrammatic Algebra of First Order Logic" (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6eFMEjT74w&amp;list=PLhgq-BqyZ7i7zHLNA3RAzfavdi5fZdw_P&amp;index=11">link to video</a>). It was based on a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07055">paper of the same name</a> he co-authored with Di Giorgio, Haydon, and Sobociński. I thought it was a fascinating talk as I have been slowly working through some of Bonchi's other works in rewrite theory, namely being:</p>

<p>I had a few outstanding questions from the talk that I was wondering if folks can help me with as well as thoughts that I wanted to share. Would be curious what everyone thinks!</p>

<p>My first question is that when Bonchi was talking about predicate functor logic, I was curious by how logic operators are captured by the fundamental notion of adjunction. I am still working on building my understanding of adjoints and, subsequently, adjunctions. Could someone explain how logic operator are captured within the notion of adjunctions?</p>

<p>It was found and proven by Monk in $1961$ that the calculus of relations did not have a complete axiomatisation and was therefore less expressive than first order logic. What does it mean for something to have a "complete axiomatisation"?</p>

<p>When Bonchi introduces the calculus of neo-Peircean relations, he mentions that this is accomplished by changing the syntax from Cartesian syntax to Monoidal syntax and by changing its semantics from binary relations to Monoidal relations. Seen in the following photo, what does syntax and semantics mean broadly in this case?</p>

<p>After the calculus of neo-Peircean relations is introduced, Bonchi introduces these two constants called <em>copier</em>'s and <em>discard</em>-er's. It seems like a copier simply creates a set of tuples where all values in each element are the same? Am I reading that right? Is that what is meant by "copier"? And similarly, for discards, is the big idea that they are "discarding" some information from the set? The discard constant is the more confusing of the two for me.</p>

<p>Otherwise, I just had some final thoughts on the talk overall:</p>
<ul>
<li>After I finished watching the talk, I was trying to summarize the big idea of what the calculus of neo-Peircean relations gives us. To me, it seems quite fantastic as we can stick to point free reasoning and have a perhaps simplified but equally as powerful toolkit in this calculus to reason about the composition of complex equations. To me, what I thought was quite powerful was the notion of the fact you can now write proofs in this logic as diagram rewrites. I think the big idea is that this calculus provides a fantastic place for one to combine multiple aspects of category theory, logic, and relations together</li>

<ul>
<li>Finally, it needs to be stated but the diagrammatic algebra that you get working within the calculus of neo-Peircean relations is absolutely stunning from a purely aesthetic sense. Some of the diagrams (which I copied here) are amazing to me because they both are aesthetically beautiful as well as their significance becomes clear in its diagrammatic language. Here are some of the diagrams but I encourage you to check out more of Bonchi's paper as there are several wonderful diagrams and explanations.</li>

<p>The calculus of relation originates from Peirce. He says that later Tarski falled in love with it. So if you want to know more about the origins, you could maybe try to look into resources on Peirce’s work. I only know about <a href="https://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~robin/FMCS/FMCS2022/slides/Nathan.pdf">these slides</a> by Nathan. At the end, there are two references on the history of the calculus of relations. Maybe interesting for you?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I think the two issues “no complete axiomatisation” and “less expressive than first order logic” are separate. I’m not sure what they mean exactly. In logic and computer science, it can be difficult to know what a proposition means if you don’t give the full details. For instance if I remember well you can both say “integration is decidable” (i.e. there exists an algorithm to integrate) or “integration is indecidable” (i.e. there doesn’t exist such an algorithm. Everything depends on what problem you’re exactly talking about when you say “integration”. Here, we run into the same issue. It is difficult to know what exactly he means. I would say that a complete axiomatisation of a mathematical object is a set of identities or other kinds of axioms which are verified by the object and which verifies moreover that you can deduce whatever is verified by this object with the sole use of these axioms. “less expressive than first order logic” should mean that you can translate somehow the calculus of relations into first-order logic but not the other way around.</p>

I first learned about their work on the calculus of relations in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08699">this paper</a> during the ACT adjoint school, and I wrote a blogpost with Phoebe Klett <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2022/07/relational_universal_algebra_w.html">here</a>.

<p>Wrt logic and adjunctions, I'd say the first thing to understand is why limits and colimits are adjoint to diagonals. That is a baby version of quantifiers as adjoints to pullback.</p>

<p>Hi! The "black composition" is also known in the literature as "relative sum" and I think Peirce was the first to introduce it. Pratt mentions it <a href="http://boole.stanford.edu/pub/ocbr.pdf">here</a></p>

<p>By "the calculus of relations" here, all we mean is the equational theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relation_algebra">relation algebras</a> given by Tarski (and his students). By a "theory" I just mean a set of first-order sentences closed under logical consequence.

<p>Here's where the connection with first-order logic comes in. The calculus of relations is actually equivalent to first-order logic with at most three variables. But it turns out this fragment is really powerful: within it you can already express Peano arithmetic! But by Gödel's incompleteness theorem, no consistent theory that can express Peano arithmetic can have an effective complete axiomatization.</p>

<p>Also note that Quine's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_functor_logic">predicate functor logic</a> (another attempt to algebraicize first order logic) has nothing to do with functors or adjoints, but is just an unfortunate coincidence of terminology.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="278070">@Evan Washington</span> , you write:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we want to give a finite or recursively enumerable set of sentences that have as their logical consequence the entire theory T.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alas, I find this a bit misleading. The equational theory $T$ of relation algebras _does_ admit a finite set of sentences $\Sigma$ so that $T \vdash \varphi$ precisely if $\Sigma \vdash \varphi$ - indeed it is outright <em>defined</em> using such a set of sentences by Tarski.</p>
<p>What does not admit a finite equational axiomatization is the set of equations that hold in precisely the <em>representable</em> relation algebras,  i.e. the ones where the underlying set is a family of binary relations on some set, and the operations are interpreted as the usual Boolean or relational operations. One can prove this using simple model-theoretic machinery without invoking Goedel.</p>
<p>I think  this is what the authors mean when they write that "<em>there is no finite complete axiomatisations for the whole calculus</em>". In any case, this is the only thing established in the reference they give, which is good, since the common equational theory of representable relation algebras <em>is</em> recursively enumerable.</p>

<p>After the calculus of neo-Peircean relations is introduced, Bonchi introduces these two constants called <em>copier</em>'s and <em>discard</em>-er's. It seems like a copier simply creates a set of tuples where all values in each element are the same? Am I reading that right? Is that what is meant by "copier"? And similarly, for discards, is the big idea that they are "discarding" some information from the set? The discard constant is the more confusing of the two for me.</p>

This interpretation is apparent in the case at hand: as you say, the white copy map simply relates any <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">x</span></span></span></span> to the duplicate <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo separator="true">,</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">(x,x),</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathnormal">x</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">x</span><span class="mclose">)</span><span class="mpunct">,</span></span></span></span> for instance. Categories admitting copy and discard maps for all objects are, imaginatively, called copy-discard categories. It's critical that the copy-discard maps are <em>not</em> natural transformations, or in other words not every map in a CD-category is a homomorphism of commutative comonoids. There's an important theorem of Fox that says that, in fact, a CD-category which is "homomorphic" in this sense is just a cartesian monoidal category! So the category of (white) relations is a non-homomorphic CD-category; other examples come from categorical probability theory.</p>
