<p>Hi. Does anyone know any example of an effective epi (also called of effective descent) between topoi that is not universal?</p>
<p>Well. Actually, I don't even know whether that is true, but, since all proofs of stability by base change that I've seen in the literature usually restrict to an specific class of effective epic (e.g., open surjections), I'm inclined to believe that it's indeed the case. I'm having a hard time finding such an example, though.</p>

<p>Hmm the examples available in, say, <em>Sketches of an Elephant</em> are indeed members of stable classes. It's worth noting that hyperconnected morphisms are shown to be descent morphisms (they have the stronger property that "locales descend along them"), so any counterexample will be essentially localic in nature. It is also mentioned that descent morphisms have to be surjections. So if you want to find an example that doesn't fall into those classes, you could test some simple surjections of locales which are neither open nor proper.<br>
Having said all that, is your question "are descent morphisms stable under pullback?"</p>

<p>At one point early on in Part C there is a class of locale maps called "triquotient maps" mentioned in passing which are a common generalization of open and proper maps. That's probably a good first class to check for descent properties.</p>

<p>I think triquotient implies descent by noticing that it defines a linear retract of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>O</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>Y</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">O(Y)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.02778em;">O</span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.22222em;">Y</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span>-algebras and, then, the equalisers after tensoring by modules will be split. The converse I think fails. For instance, a surjection between compact Hausdorff spaces seems to satisfy descent (not entirely sure of that last statement, though).</p>

<p>That observation alone is definitely something worth putting into the world somewhere. What's your interest in descent morphisms? I have never understood them in any depth (I just know where I could read about them if I wanted to). Is there a reason for you expecting/not expecting them to be stable?</p>

<p>Well. That observation is not very original. The same argument ist already in Joyal-Tierney's monograph on Galois Theory. And I've just noticed that my "counter example" is not a counter example: a continuous map between compacta is always proper. </p>
<p>My interest is because I'm trying to prove some generalisations of Joyal-Tierney's theorem and I want to get a feel of what kind of effective epis (if any) I should be careful of. </p>
<p>I don't really have any good reason to not expect they are not stable besides the one I've already mentioned:in the literature, people usually restrict to a subcollection when they need stability by base change.</p>
<p>But regarding your previous conjecture: effective descent implies triquotient. Maybe a frame morphism defining a faithfully flat module that doesn't have a linear retract might do the job (as a counter example). The problem is finding one (in case it exists).</p>

<p>Nah. That won't work. All suplattices are dualisable. With that, one can prove pure morphisms have retracts. Since any morphism of effective descent must be pure, my suggestion is wrong. So I think triquotient is really the same as effective descent. And therefore effective descent is really stable by base change. </p>
<p>I keep forgetting that suplattices are not like usual modules over rings since they are always dualisable.</p>

<p>Yes, suplattices are dualisable in the compact closed sense if and only if they are (constructively) completely distributive.</p>

<p>I will restrict my attention to effective descent morphisms of locales, since I understand those better and it should be no weaker a condition than the topos-theoretic one.

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="557567">@Fernando Yamauti</span>  What makes you think that every effective descent morphism is a triquotient map? It is definitely false for topological spaces, for example. It is also false for finite locales.<br>
On the other hand I think it might be true that no one has given an example of an effective descent morphism in the category of locales that is not a triquotient, though I would be surprised if one doesn't exit. I have been thinking about this myself recently.</p>

<p>I will restrict my attention to effective descent morphisms of locales, since I understand those better and it should be no weaker a condition than the topos-theoretic one. Certainly in this setting it is true that effective descent morphisms are stable under pullback by a general theorem about morphisms that are effective descent with respect to the codomain fibration.</p>

<p>Nice. What's the statement of that general theorem? Where can I read about that?</p>

<p>It's on the nlab page: <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/descent+morphism#properties">https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/descent+morphism#properties</a></p>

<p><span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="557567">Fernando Yamauti</span>  What makes you think that every effective descent morphism is a triquotient map? It is definitely false for topological spaces, for example. It is also false for finite locales.<br>
On the other hand I think it might be true that no one has given an example of an effective descent morphism in the category of locales that is not a triquotient, though I would be surprised if one doesn't exit. I have been thinking about this myself recently.</p>

<p>You are using a different definition of effective descent morphism compared to what people usually talk about. You are considering descent with respect to modules over the frames instead of with respect to the codomain fibration. I think your version is also stable under pullback though. You can probably prove it directly without much difficultly.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I don't think triquotients or proper surjections will be effective descent in this sense.</p>

<p>Even for modules over a frame the category is not *-autonomous with respect to this functor, so this isn't really a disanalogy.

<p>These are definitely different. The category of suplattices behaves differently to the category of abelian groups, so I don't know how reasonable it is to expect categories of the corresponding modules to behave similarly in every respect.</p>

<p>You are using a different definition of effective descent morphism compared to what people usually talk about. You are considering descent with respect to modules over the frames instead of with respect to the codomain fibration. I think your version is also stable under pullback though.

<p>On the other hand, I don't think triquotients or proper surjections will be effective descent in this sense.</p>

<p>Hmm. Okay. This is indeed the usual notion for toposes that I was trying to avoid above because I understand it less well than notion usually considered for locales.

I think it is good to have a name for this and this name is reasonable, though I haven't heard of this being used before.)</p>

<p>I don't see why an effective descent morphism in your sense gives a retraction in this way and I feel like it should not be true. Where did you get this result from?</p>
<p>(But also, the triquotient assignment doesn't preserve joins, so unless I misunderstand what you mean it doesn't give a 'linear' retract.)</p>

<p>Hmm. Okay. This is indeed the usual notion for toposes that I was trying to avoid above because I understand it less well than notion usually considered for locales. (By the way, where did you get the terminology <em>effective 2-epimorphism</em>? I think it is good to have a name for this and this name is reasonable, though I haven't heard of this being used before.)</p>

<p>I don't see why an effective descent morphism in your sense gives a retraction in this way and I feel like it should not be true. Where did you get this result from?</p>
<p>(But also, the triquotient assignment doesn't preserve joins, so unless I misunderstand what you mean it doesn't give a 'linear' retract.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's Prop.3 at p.12 (pure morphisms have linear retracts) and Thm. 1 at p.18 (descent iff pure) in Joyal-Tierney's AMS memoirs on Galois theory.  In that case, the triquotient assignment will preserve all small joins, so, in particular, also the directed ones.</p>

Pure morphisms are not the same as the effective descent morphisms you are talking about, they are effective descent for modules, not for sheaves.

<p>I think you have your second sentence backwards, triquotient assignments preserve directed joins, not all small joins, but you need them to preserve all joins.</p>

<p>Hmm...I see. So a morphism of locales that is of effective descent for modules also is of effective descent. However, a morphism of locales that is of effective descent might not be always enlarged to a morphism of effective descent for modules (since it, a priori, just descends specific modules). Thanks. That seems helpful.</p>
<p>Now. Regarding my argument, I didn't get anything backwards. What I'm saying is that if <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8889em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.10764em;">f</span></span></span></span> is of effective descent for modules, then the respective linear retract defines a triquotient assignment. That assignment preserves all joins because it was already chosen to do so.</p>
<p>What doesn't work is the converse. A triquotient assignment might not preserve arbitrary joins, so I cannot deduce that it is of effective descent for modules. But, by Plewe's result, it is of effective descent (in the usual sense). The proof seems very non-trivial, though.</p>
<p>That's clarifies a lot of things. Still, the reduction from topoi to locales for claiming the stability under base change requires that the argument should be valid for any base topos (first, use the hyperconnected-localic factorisation as <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277473">@Morgan Rogers (he/him)</span>  suggested and, then, claim the result for the respective internal locales). That I'm not very comfortable with. Maybe there's a more direct argument... But, even for <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6444em;"></span><span class="mord">1</span></span></span></span>-cats, effective epimorphisms shouldn't always be stable by base change, right? I wonder if I there's a higher version of that theorem for codomain fibrations you've mentioned and, then, I can work directly with the <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">2</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6444em;"></span><span class="mord">2</span></span></span></span>-cat of topoi.</p>

<p>Effective epimorphisms don't need to be stable under pullback, but effective descent morphisms (with respect the codomain fibration) do. If you use a different notion of effective descent morphism or an effective 2-epimorphism in a general 2-category, it might not be stable under base change. What is probably is true is that the 2-dimensional version of effective descent morphism is stable under base change, but this isn't exactly what you are talking about.</p>
<p>Effective descent morphisms of locales are not the same as effective 2-epimorphisms of the corresponding localic toposes. Effective decent morphisms of locales are a stronger condition since they allow descent of all localic bundles instead of just sheaves. Probably the notion you want is also pullback stable, but that would require it's own proof.</p>

<p>Nice, I'm glad someone who has more actively worked with descent morphisms stepped in, thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="386922">@Graham Manuell</span> . The fact that we can characterize descent morphisms via the Čech complex makes them a lot clearer to me; this discussion is about whether the 2-category of topoi is "regular" (for one of the 2-categorical generalizations of that concept). This reminds me of a discussion I listened in on between Mattieu Anel and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277180">@Simon Henry</span> years ago where they were trying to figure out a characterization of the 2-category of (1-)topoi... fun!</p>

<p>Yes, I agree this is a nice way to think about descent. For whatever reason, the version of regular 2-categories people usually study involves what I think amounts to lax descent rather than descent, but yes, this would be the analogue that uses bipullbacks / iso-comma objects instead of comma objects for the kernel pairs.</p>
