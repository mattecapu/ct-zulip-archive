<p>Is there an established name for a compact closed category in which every object is self-dual?  (I suspect that unlike ordinary compact closedness this is additional structure on a symmetric monoidal category.)</p>

<p>In the literature this is often called a "self dual compact closed category".</p>
<p>I think this terminology is justified as opposed to merely saying a compact closed category with self dual objects because the transpose becomes a dagger functor, thus it is actually isomorphic to its opposite category. However, I don't know if a self dual category which happens to be compact closed is automatically "self dual compact closed" in this sense.</p>

<p>The category of dualizable (i.e. finitely-generated and projective) modules over a ring is equivalent to its own opposite category, but it's not always the case that the dual of a module is isomorphic to itself (although I don't have any good examples of this in my head).</p>

<p>Any compact closed category is equivalent to its opposite by the dualization functor, and by fattening up the category you can make that equivalence into an isomorphism.  So I don't think "self dual compact closed category" is a good name.  I had thought of "locally-self-dual compact closed category".</p>

<p>(By analogy with "locally presentable category", whose objects are presentable.)</p>

<p>"Locally" is one of the most egregiously overloaded terms in category theory. That said, I don't have an alternative suggestion for the moment :)</p>
