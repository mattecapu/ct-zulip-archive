<p>Can anyone recommend an introduction to category theory that emphasizes the perspective of categories as a kind of algebraic structure, generalizing groups, monoids, and posets?  This perspective is of course present to varying degrees in all introductions; but I'm looking for something that would be maximally accessible to a student with limited background in abstract mathematics, so that many of the "usual" examples of large categories would not be familiar.</p>

<p>As someone with a limited background in abstract mathematics, I've found parts of these two fairly accessible:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Notes on Category Theory with examples from basic mathematics" by Perrone</li>
<li>"Seven Sketches in Compositionality: An Invitation to Applied Category Theory" by Fong and Spivak</li>
</ul>
<p>Parts of these books talk about categories in the way you are describing.</p>
<p>Also, the very first book on categories I looked at was "Category Theory for Scientists" by Spivak. This book did a great job at making category theory interesting to me, although the emphasis on "ologs" isn't to my preference.</p>
<p>I haven't looked carefully at this book, but "The Joy of Abstraction" by Cheng I think has a few sections focused on examples along the lines you describe above.</p>
<p>I should also mention "Algebra: Chapter Zero" by Aluffi. I find it hard reading, but very rewarding. I'm not sure I would call it "maximally accessible", but it does talk a bit about categories in the context of algebra.</p>

<p>My <a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/qg-winter2016/">category theory lecture notes</a> has a section called "Categories as mathematical objects" on page 6, which is about algebraic gadgets like posets and monoids as categories.

<p>I like Part 0 of Lambek--Scott. It's a very efficient 40-page summary of basic category theory, organized by "slogans". Slogan II says that many mathematical objects -- such as sets, monoids, and preordered sets -- can be viewed as categories.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277503">@David Egolf</span> As far as I know, the idea of associating to a space its category of sheaves also played a crucial role in the construction of étale cohomology, because it allowed one to use the formalism of derived functors. This in turn was used in the proof of the Weil conjectures. I don't know much about it, but it feels like this is the perfect example of category theory being used in mathematics to prove concrete statements about the number of solutions of polynomial equations (over finite fields).</p>

<p>That's what "categories as mathematical objects" was supposed to be about, actually.   Maybe I should say it the other way.   My idea, anyway, was to get people used to thinking of categories not only as "universes" like "the category of all groups" or "the category of all posets", but also as small manageable things just like individual groups and posets and equivalence relations... in part by noticing that groups and posets and equivalence relations <em>are categories!</em></p>

<p>These things are great, but some of them don't belong in a basic introduction to category theory, because they have significant prerequisites from pure math, which tends to intimidate a lot of people, while attracting others.</p>
<p>It would, however, be great to write a <em>series</em> of books teaching math with categories, starting with basic stuff and leading up to these fancier examples.</p>

<p>I have gotten in the habit of saying "category theory in the small" vs "category theory in the large" to mark this distinction, especially in cases where both are going on at the same time.

<p>I have seen several introductory books that talk about modelling a preorder, group, or monoid as a category (as mentioned above). However, I don't remember seeing an introductory book that talks about a ring as a category, or a topological space as a category. In a hypothetical book that talks about how certain mathematical structures can be easily modelled as categories, it might be nice to also give some non-examples: mathematical objects that take a bit more work (or more fancy notions) to describe as categories (or perhaps are not productive to try and view as categories). To the beginning reader (like me!), it would be instructive to learn why some mathemtical objects are not as easily modelled as categories.</p>

<p>I think the examples of algebraic structures like posets, groups, and monoids that can literally be viewed as categories are very special.  In general, there's no reason an arbitrary mathematical structure should be modelable as a category.  To me the viewpoint of "category theory in the small" is just that categories are an algebraic structure <em>like</em> groups, monoids, rings, etc.</p>

When introducing category theory, I don't want my readers to think at all about size issues in the set-theoretic sense.   But I do want to point out the difference between using a category as a context in which you study objects of some sort, versus treating a category itself as the object of study.    This distinction is psychologically important to beginners.   Too many introductions to category theory focus on the first kind of example, not enough on the second.  As a result, they tend to visualize a category as a misty sort of "background" in which objects sit.  I want them to also be able to see a category as something like a tiny ant.</p>

<p>Yes, these examples are a bit more sophisticated. But they're really important!  So I think a good modern intro to categories has got to talk about enriched categories at some point, so readers can see a ring as a one-object Ab-enriched category.  And I think it's got to talk a bit about locales, so readers can learn to think of topology not in terms of a set of points with a topology has slapped on, but rather a poset of "opens".</p>

<p>Part of why I want to encourage beginners to think a lot about "small, manageable" categories is that they can then transfer the some of the intuitions they build that way to large categories like Set and Grp, or at least lose some of their fear of these these categories.</p>

<p>My dream book would teach kids lots of pure math using category theory; they wouldn't need to know this math ahead of time, and everything would be a lot faster and easier and clearer and more unified and more fun than in a traditional treatment.   So I wouldn't be focused on people who say "I already know math, how can category theory help me prove things I can't already prove?"   It would be focused on people who say "I want to learn lots of math.  Can you teach me?"</p>

Rather, I think he was just curious if there <em>are</em> cases in mathematics in which one studies a mathematical object by assigning to it a category. But we'll let him talk for himself. <span aria-label="grinning face with smiling eyes" class="emoji emoji-1f601" role="img" title="grinning face with smiling eyes">:grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:</span></p>

<p>Well, all the stuff being discussed in this thread is quite interesting!</p>
<p>But here's what I had in mind:</p>
<p>Assume we have some mathematical object of interest. I'm interested in the process of generating categories that are helpful for studying it. This might look like viewing the mathematical object itself as a category, but it could instead involve viewing the mathematical object as an object in some category, or as a functor between categories. This could also involve studying the relationships between similar mathematical objects, when each is modelled as an object in some category. Broadly, I'm interested in the process of producing statements in the language of category theory that tell us things about a mathematical object.</p>
<p>One reason why I think this can be difficult is that a lot of flexibility is available. For each category we deem useful to studying a mathematical object of interest, we can produce many new categories and functors - each of which potentially provide a slightly different angle of study. Learning about examples of how people have navigated this flexibility to produce categories useful for studying the original mathematical objects would be interesting to me.</p>
<p>Closely related to this, I'm also interested in studying the process of mathematical study, using the language of category theory. It's awesome how category theory can help us draw parallels between theorems in different categories about mathematical objects, but - for example - it would also be exciting to use it to draw parallels between strategies used for constructing or defining interesting objects. To take a particular example, there are quite a few concepts that come together to define a smooth manifold - could one tease apart the process of reasoning that puts all these concepts together, and then state it in more general category  theoretic language that could be applied in other settings?</p>

<p>Okay, thanks!  Those are very broad goals, and it would be nice if some mathematician thought about them and tried to discuss them at this level of breadth.  I haven't seen anything except dozens of special cases.</p>

<p>There's an interesting problem with all these kinds of manifolds.  Each kind of manifold is a kind of space where <em>locally</em> you have a clear picture of what that space is like.   This makes it fairly easy to work <em>locally</em> on manifolds, so a lot of the deeper questions involve the <em>global</em> study of manifolds.</p>

<p>But the presence of this clear and quite restrictive <em>local</em> description of manifolds means that the category of manifolds of any particular kind is quite lacking in limits and colimits.

<p>Thanks to both of you for your interesting responses! It's always fun to hear about concepts completely new to me - I had never heard of "diffeological spaces" before, for example.</p>
<p>However, to appreciate these fancier concepts, I suspect I would need to learn a lot more about the historical concepts they emerged from. There is so much to learn!</p>

<p>Diffeological spaces are less fancy than manifolds, by the way.   That's why they form a nicer category.   But they are newer, for sure.</p>

<p>the naming is very unfortunate though, esp. when you consider that this is an instance of "every X is a colimit of free X" which generally doesn't have a name. I'm a partisan of talking about the Yoneda "principle" instead, and then all other results are corollaries of this principle.</p>

<p>A lot of people who encounter this theorem view it as a magical hammer rather than something very intuitive, and I think the name contributes to that feeling. Also, the "co" in co-Yoneda doesn't make much sense to me. It just feels like an attempt to bend the Yoneda name to encompass every fact related to presheaves. Just give it a different name!</p>
