<p>In category theory, when teaching the naturality condition for a natural transformation we often say that naturality captures the fact that it is somehow made without reference to any specific properties of the elements involved,  in an ad-hoc way that depends somehow on the set or the elements of the set.<br>
However, it is difficult to make this intuition precise and rigorous, it is not obvious how to make it a precise mathematical statement that "no ad hoc choices are involved, it is uniform." I do not think that it should be considered a rigorous proof to say "We have made no ad hoc choices, so it is obviously natural".<br>
Using the axiom of choice we can easily prove the existence of non-natural transformations.<br>
But in type theory, we can actually express the concept of "abstraction" in a way that we cannot in set theory, we can express that a construction is <em>polymorphic</em> in its input type, which is a kind of abstraction away from the details of the type that cannot be expressed in set theory.<br>
I was somewhat shocked to come across the following paper by Wadler where he opens with the following theorem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every un-natural endo-transformation of the List functor (free monoid monad) in polymorphic type theory (i.e., prima facie not necessarily having to be coherent with the action on morphisms) is automatically natural.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then goes on to prove a general class of theorems of this form about polymorphic type constructors. I thought this was incredible, it's insane that I was not aware of it.<br>

<p>Yeah, parametricity is mind-blowing!</p>

<p>I also just discovered this in yesterday's stream of <a href="#narrow/stream/229141-community.3A-events/topic/Binary.20Operation">Binary Operation</a>. I found some interesting complementary discussion <a href="https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/136359/rigorous-proof-that-parametric-polymorphism-implies-naturality-using-parametrici">here</a>.</p>

<p>Oh, I'm sure I must have seen that post and forgotten it but the paper title stuck in my head.</p>
