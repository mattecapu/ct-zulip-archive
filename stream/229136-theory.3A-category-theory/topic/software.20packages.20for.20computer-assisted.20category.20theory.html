<p>A lot of category theory is categorized by a lot of difficult and time consuming combinatorics. Recently I have been computing a lot of Kan extensions, adjoints, coends and so on between presheaf categories, and I am doing a lot of counting. Do any of you use software packages to help you explicitly describe a left adjoint, or a left Kan extension, or anything like that? I am thinking of something like SAGE or Macaulay2 or GAP but i have no idea whether these are useful for enriched category theory,  monoidal category theory, or things like this. I have no experience with these tools.</p>

<p>I guess in the cases where I can more explicitly describe what is to be counted I can rephrase the problem using standard combinatorics with the categorical language taken away. So for example, it's well known that the simplex category is the free monoidal category with distinguished monoid, aka the "Walking monoid." right now I'm working out simple cases of the other free monoidal categories. A general question we could ask is like, suppose I am interested in the free monoidal category (or free symmetric monoidal category) generated by objects m1,... mk together with these morphisms between them and their tensor products and modulo certain relations on morphisms. I can always describe this category in a very broad and vague way by generators and relations but like, for the simplex category we have a very short list of generators and relations and we can explicitly count the morphisms between objects in this category. To expand in the same direction I'd want to be able to do the same thing for categories enriched over pointed sets or Abelian groups, so that I could talk about relations on additive combinations of morphisms, i.e. talk about Lie algebras, derivations, things like that, and ask what the free category is generated by a Lie algebra in an Ab-enriched monoidal category, and explicitly count morphisms between objects.</p>
<p>One more example: if I have two small categories A and B, let's say indexed by the natural numbers, and a functor F : A -&gt; B, and a presheaf P on A, there are standard formulas for how to compute the left/right Kan extension of P along F. In many cases we can very explicitly describe this in terms of P. I should be able to program a computer to compute this Kan extension much the same way I do it in practice: I figure out some generators and relations presentation of the morphisms in the categories and then the left Kan extension is given by all formal pairs (f,x) with f : c -&gt; d and x\in P(d), modded out by certain equivalence relations. I want to describe what this set looks like in a way that isn't just the naive/abstract presentation.</p>

<p>Perhaps you might be interested in Anne Heyworth's thesis from Bangor many years ago (we were way ahead of our time!)  Some idea of what it contains can be gleaned from Ronald Brown, Anne Heyworth:<br>
Using Rewriting Systems to Compute Left Kan Extensions and Induced Actions of Categories. J. Symb. Comput. 29(1): 5-31 (2000)<br>
One of the points is that sometimes rewriting theory is well adapted for calculations. Another point in the thesis is the use of Grobner Bases  in such calculations.  The thesis is at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9812097">https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9812097</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks for sharing these interesting problems. I am also interested in computational category theory. In <a href="https://github.com/AlgebraicJulia/Catlab.jl">Catlab</a>, we have a fairly mature implementation of presheaves over finitely presented categories. For example, we can compute limits and colimits in presheaf categories and we can enumerate the homomorphisms between two presheaves (with the caveat that homomorphism finding is generally NP-hard).</p>
<p>So far we have been more focused on combinatorial data structures and algorithms than symbolic computer algebra, and we certainly can't do all of the things you described. However, I'd like to make some forays in this direction. For instance, besides its theoretical interest, computing left and right Kan extensions in presheaf categories has very practical applications (Spivak's "functorial data migration"). There is a small literature on computing Kan extensions, but I haven't yet delved into it. I'd be willing to try coding something up as long as it doesn't seem <em>too</em> hard and complicated.</p>

<p>The papers are now about 15 years old, so some of the ideas may have been given other names since.</p>
<p>Other people to look at as being interested in the rewriting aspect  are [Philippe Malbos (<a href="http://math.univ-lyon1.fr/homes-www/malbos/">http://math.univ-lyon1.fr/homes-www/malbos/</a>)  and Yves Guiraud) (<a href="https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~yves.guiraud/">https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~yves.guiraud/</a>).

<p>This is a really interesting thread to me. I've played with trying to encode categorical problems to some of the systems out there, in particular SMT solvers and Automated Theorem Provers with very mixed success and failure <a href="https://www.philipzucker.com/theorem-proving-for-catlab-2-lets-try-z3-this-time-nope/">https://www.philipzucker.com/theorem-proving-for-catlab-2-lets-try-z3-this-time-nope/</a> <a href="https://www.philipzucker.com/category-theory-in-the-e-automated-theorem-prover/">https://www.philipzucker.com/category-theory-in-the-e-automated-theorem-prover/</a> . I don't have a system ready to use. I do think it sounds interesting and doable to take truly finite category theory problems and encode them to SAT, but such a problem is more the exception than the rule <a href="https://www.philipzucker.com/z3-and-the-word-problem/">https://www.philipzucker.com/z3-and-the-word-problem/</a> . I'm currently on a kick of trying to use egraphs to encode category theory. It gives you a notion of equality and quantification to play with that seems useful <a href="https://www.philipzucker.com/rust-category/">https://www.philipzucker.com/rust-category/</a> <a href="https://www.philipzucker.com/egglog-checkpoint/">https://www.philipzucker.com/egglog-checkpoint/</a> None of these really would ever have the flavor of GAP or Macaulay, which are big systems.</p>

<p>I don't know how "automated" it is exactly but the full proof looks to be around 3,000 lines and i doubt they wrote the bulk of that by hand.</p>
