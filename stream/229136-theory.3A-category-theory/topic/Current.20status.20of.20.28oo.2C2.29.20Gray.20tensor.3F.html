<p>Theorems about this higher Gray tensor product were stated by Gaitsgory and Rozenblyum in (volume 1 of) their book published in 2017, but which is more or less the 'foundational' document setting out a bunch of ground theory for the recent proof of the geometric Langlands conjecture(s). However they openly stated they don't give proofs, and they don't know of any in the literature. I'd be grateful to know the current status of these statements and pointers to places where they have been proved, if at all:</p>

<p>Oh, that's interesting.   Maybe there's work left to be done in the current proof of the geometric Langlands conjecture, just as there was in Lurie's proof of the cobordism hypothesis.   (Lurie, of course, called it a "proof sketch".)</p>

<p>The commenter was me! I am finding myself a tad annoyed at how hard it is to get a clear sense of the status of these statements. I think Abellán in particular seems to be writing a bit defensively or something, like he's nervous about making clear claims about whether he's resolving something by such eminences as G&amp;R. I wish we had a nice clear Schelling point somewhere to simply clear this up, and I guess your post will be it now, David, so thanks for thinking to do this! It's been intermittently bugging me for 8 years.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="609515">@Kevin Carlson</span>  yes, sorry! I haven't even had breakfast yet, I forgot to say.</p>
<p>I'm very much reminded of what Clark Barwick said about the state of homotopy theory as a field, whereby people claim things and the proofs don't appear (or appear in print) and so young people who could make a reputation by resolving an open-stated conjecture by a well-known mathematician cannot get credit, for merely writing up a proof by someone else. (This is a subtly different problem to the folklore disease in category theory, I think, but not unrelated)</p>

<p>I certainly pulled my punches at the MO question, and the disclaimer is to ward off irrelevant arguments, but I honestly don't think people should claim big proofs without specifying clearly there are open problems. I haven't read the big papers on GLC, but if they had a warning in the introduction specifying that the authors left to others the establishment of certain technical facts that aren't expected to be false, then I would be impressed by the honesty.

<p>I find it entirely misleading (even deceitful) to state something in the form of a proposition or theorem when it doesn't have a proof, and I find it frustrating that referees permit it. It would be easy for a reader to cite such a "theorem" without even realising it hasn't been proven elsewhere.</p>

<p>However, down that road lies claims like those made by the team that spelled out hastily-sketched technical details in Perelman's proof of the Poincaré conjecture, and then kinda claimed they 'finished' the proof.</p>

<p>I believe the mathematical community would discourage such claims. (I don't see why those that "finish" a proof should be credited more highly than those who have contributed most to the proof.) Certainly this appears to have happened in the case you mention (as you point out <a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@highergeometer/114300373293486691">later in the thread</a>).</p>

Maybe this should be moved to another thread, but I wonder why this is the case:</p>
<ul>
<li>is it because there is more theory available to backup their constructions,</li>
<li>or that the objects they define exists more naturally in those iterated simplicial sets,</li>
<li>or that it's just what people are used to work with,</li>
<li>... ?</li>
<li>(or am I just wrong in thinking that, and please give me counterexamples)  </li>
</ul>
<p>I also don't think this is too much the case for <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex"> n = 1 </annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">n</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">=</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6444em;"></span><span class="mord">1</span></span></span></span>, so why is that that people are not working with, say, variations on complicial sets, which are just fancy quasicategories with some marking anyway?</p>

</ul>
<p>For those of the second sort, presumably it is quite convenient to work with Segal models which are founded on iterated weak enrichment, whereas for the first sort shaped models (and in particularly the diagrammatic one for being the most "uniform") would have an edge.</p>
<p>The Gray tensor product, on the other hand, is paradigmatic of the first sort, even in the strict setting, so it is not surprising that Segal models struggle with it.</p>

<p>I didn't mean to write defensive in the paper though... I guess it is important to make clear that it was not a theorem as stated in GR book.</p>
<p>In any case, I'm soon posting a new version of the paper where the theory is built from scratch. I prove directly that the Gray tensor product satisfies all the desired properties without resorting to models or comparisons (colimit preservation, associativity and that it defines a monoidal structure on the (infinity )2-category of 2-categories and icons )  </p>
<p>I will also show that all versions (that I know of) in the literature of the Gray tensor product (of 2-cats) agree.</p>
<p>Happy to answer any questions! :)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276422">@David Michael Roberts</span> , I think those claims are already resolved in the current version of my preprint.  The main claims I am referring to are: The Gray tensor product is  associative and commutes with colimits separately in each variable. (There are some other unproven formulas for the Gray tensor product in terms of the square functor that I didn't work out last time but I will include this time.)</p>
<p>In the current version this  is proven as follows: We know these properties hold for the Gagna-Harpaz-Lanari version in terms of scaled simplicial sets, so my approach is to compare this version with the GR approach.</p>
<p>The new approach is not so different, the key difference is that everything is built up from scratch without ever mentioning model categories. So I construct a Gray tensor product (equivalent to that of GR almost by definition), show that it has the expected properties (hence GR's version does) and further compare this tensor product with the other existing approaches.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>

<p>I’m a bit surprised you say you *think * the claims are already resolved. Those claims were left open in a book that’s been the foundation of a program to resolve geometric Langlands that hundreds of people have been working on. If I were you working on this, I’d be sure to have an extremely crisp section right in my introductions listing exactly where and how to use my work to resolve each open statement in R-G, because I’d be assuming finding out about the open questions from R-G was a major source of readers.</p>

<p>I guess I was intending to say " I am not sure if I am forgetting about some claims" I probably rushed my answer. I think in the current version it is clearly stated the conjectures I solve. See Theorem 2, Corollary 1 and Corollary 3 in the introduction.</p>

<p>If I were you working on this, I’d be sure to have an extremely crisp section right in my introductions listing exactly where and how to use my work to resolve each open statement in R-G, because I’d be assuming finding out about the open questions from R-G was a major source of readers.</p>

<p>Yes, that would make the paper much more useful - and also more popular, which will be good if Fernando wants to get a permanent job.   (Just some unsolicited advice from an old mathematician who has been on many hiring committees.)</p>

<p>For reference, here's the passage from G&amp;R where they spell out what they say are the questions left open:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>0.4. Status of the assertions.</strong>  <br>
0.4.1. Unfortunately, the existing literature on (∞, 2)-categories does not contain<br>
the proofs of all the statements that we need. We decided to leave some of the<br>
statements unproved, and supply the corresponding proofs elsewhere (including<br>
the proofs here would have altered the order of the exposition, and would have<br>
come at the expense of clarity).  <br>
0.4.2. Here is the list of the unproved statements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proposition 3.2.6 says that the formation of Gray product commutes with colimits in each variable.</li>
<li>Proposition 3.2.9 asserts the associativity of the Gray product.</li>
<li>Theorems 4.1.3, Theorem 4.3.5, Theorem 4.6.3 and Theorem 5.2.3 are all generalizations of the assertion that the functor $\mathrm{Seq}^{\mathrm{ext}}_{\bullet}$ (or, rather, its variant $\mathrm{Sq}^{\mathrm{Pair}}_{\bullet,\bullet}$)<br>
is fully faithful with specified essential image.</li>
<li>Proposition 4.5.4  gives an explicit description of the Gray product in terms of<br>
the functor $\mathrm{Sq}^{\mathrm{Pair}}_{\bullet,\bullet}$.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is quite possible that references for (some of) the above statements do exist, and we would be grateful if the reader could point them out to us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can't say definitively that this is in fact the entire list of things they don't prove, but I would suggest, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="898412">@Fernando Abellán</span> that you refer to this 10.0.4.2 (i.e. chapter 10, section 0.4.2 above) and be extremely explicit what you have completed from this list.</p>
<p>On page 3 of the linked document, you write in item 6.:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"...thus answering another question in [GR17]."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which is underselling the result. You mention earlier in item 3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We show in Corollary 1 that the Gray tensor product of complete Segal objects (or 2-<br>
fold complete Segal spaces) in (∞, 1)-categories given in [GR17] defines a closed monoidal<br>
structure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which doesn't say that this was an open problem in GR17 and a property (or corollaries of this) that they crucially rely on.</p>
<p>Even in the appendix, the statement</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"As a corollary, we derive that the Gray tensor product of (∞, 2)-categories as defined by Gaitsgory-Rozenblyum is equivalent to that of Gagna-Harpaz-Lanari."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>absolutely buries the lede that you are filling unproved steps from the foundations of Gaitsgory's program.</p>
<p>I myself would say <em>in the abstract</em> that you resolve all (or some) of the claims in GR17 about (oo,2)-categories, because most people would have no idea that what you claim does this, or its importance.</p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I wanted to give a bit of an overview of the progress on the unproven claims of the Gaitsgory-Rozenblyum  book. To summarize, it seems to me that they are all proven except for one (but which should be soon).</p>
<p>In what follows, I will refer to works that use a priori other definitions of the Gray tensor product that the one of Gaitsgory-Rozenblyum. However, as was mentioned earlier, Fernando proved that the Gray product in the Gaitsgory-Rozenblyum version is the same as in the Gagna-Harpaz-Lanari version. Moreover, even though I don’t think it’s clearly written in the literature (which is unfortunate, I admit), the Gagna-Harpaz-Lanari product is equivalent to all the other definitions I know.</p>
<p>There were 8 claims for which the proofs were missing.</p>
<p>• Propositions 3.2.6 and 3.3.9 concern the Gray tensor product (commutation with colimits and associativity). They should therefore follow from the comparison between the definition by Gaitsgory-Rozenblyum and the one by Gagna-Harpaz-Lanari, since Gagna-Harpaz-Lanari demonstrate that their version satisfies these properties (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14495">https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14495</a>)</p>
<p>• Proposition 3.3.5 discusses the fact that the iterated Gray product of simplices is an (strict) 2-category. To my knowledge, this result is not stated as such in the literature. However, I think one can deduce it quite directly from the results of Campion and Maehara presented in their article <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05965">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05965</a></p>
<p>• Then there are Theorems 4.1.3, 4.3.5, 4.3.8, and 5.2.3 which discuss the square functor and its variants. The first was proven by Fernando (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12746">https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12746</a>), and the last three in my latest preprint (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19242">https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19242</a>)</p>
<p>• Finally, there is Proposition 4.5.4 which gives yet another definition of the Gray tensor product.<br>
It should appear in a forthcoming article written with Jaco Ruit, but also in the new version of Fernando’s paper.</p>
<p>It is very possible that I forgot to cite some works, and I apologize in advance. Let me know if this is the case !</p>

<p>After looking more closely, I think that once we admit that all these Gray tensor products coincide, Corollary 7.11 of Maehara’s article <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.11757">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.11757</a> implies Proposition 3.3.5 of Gaitsgory-Rozenblyum.</p>

<p>Short answer: Yes, I think Proposition 3.3.5 can be proved using the 2-quasi-categorical Gray tensor product assuming Fernando's result.<br>
Details: I don't know exactly what Fernando proves, so I'll start with the minimal assumption: the 2-quasi-categorical Gray tensor product computes the "correct" object at least in the binary case. (It is a left Quillen bifunctor with respect to Ara's model structure, and the induced oo-bifunctor agrees with the one defined by Day extension in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05965">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05965</a>; please see Remark 3.4 of that paper.) Although this tensor product is not associative up to isomorphism, it is associative up to homotopy in the best possible sense I can think of. (This is Corollary 7.11 of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.11757">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.11757</a> that Félix mentioned; "cell(...)" there is a subclass of the trivial cofibrations.) In particular, [n_1,...,n_k] in Proposition 3.3.5 of Gaitsgory-Rozenblyum can be computed by simply applying the k-ary Gray tensor product (Definition 3.1 of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.11757">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.11757</a>) to the representable Theta_2-sets corresponding to [n_i]'s, but this is <em>defined</em> to be the nerve of the corresponding 2-categorical Gray tensor product.</p>

<p>Just to be clear. In the current version, there is no comparison with the 2-quasi-categorical Gray tensor. </p>
<p>This is not hard to prove and will be included in the new version.  </p>

<p>Thank you to everyone who chimed in! Can someone post an answer over on MathOverflow that explains the above status of the various claims? Of course, it can wait until after the new version of the paper by Fernando is out, and/or the Loubaton–Ruit paper lands. There's no real rush, I just want to get this all on the public record.</p>
<p>Also, I strongly suggest <em>someone</em> include in their paper a proof of Proposition 3.3.5 using all the tech mentioned by Félix and Yuki, rather than it being left for experts to know because they read the technical literature and can see how the pieces make it fit together. What we have here is a chance to set a good example and stamp out the emergence of a new piece of folklore.</p>
