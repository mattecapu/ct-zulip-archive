<p>I'm trying to start streaming/vtubering mathematics (there are already some people on twitch teaching analysis lol). I want to find an open source (real-time) collaborative whiteboard (one similar to microsoft's whiteboard, say) that supports LaTeX and preferably HTML iframe/embedding. Do anyone have any previous experience with these or have any recommendations?</p>

<p>I thought I might ask this question here, as someone might have come across a similar problem:</p>
<p>I currently work with my supervisor remotely, which in general works fine, but after having tried out numerous online whiteboards, we still haven't found one that satisfies all our needs. <br>
The use case is basically the same as a physical whiteboard / blackboard would be, if we would meet physically: Writing equations, drawing diagrams, erasing stuff and redrawing... An additional nice advantage of a digital whiteboard  over a physical one is that you can copy and past stuff on the board (which comes in very handy if you are doing a lot of string diagram rewriting).<br>
The problem is that all the whiteboard apps we came across so far either don't work well on one of our devices (for example, <a href="http://www.excalidraw.com">excalidraw</a> works great on my windows laptop / tablet, but not so well on his iPad) or the performance of the synchronization is poor  (<a href="https://www.goodnotes.com/">goodnotes</a>, for example, works well on both our devices, but when one party writes / draws something, it takes up to several seconds for the other party to see it).</p>
<p>Does anyone know a whiteboard app which works well on both Windows and iOS devices and allows actual real-time synchronization? It would be preferable if it also recognized pen buttons for erasing / selecting content on both devices.</p>

<p>Since you don't seem to need LaTeX integration, I can suggest looking for barebones web-based solutions. I used <a href="https://r8.whiteboardfox.com/">Whiteboard Fox</a> during the peak of the COVID pandemic, and it was pleasant to use. The exporting options worked badly iirc.</p>

But the problem with both Whiteboard Fox and miro, as with most web-based solutions, is that they don't recognize pen buttons, which is a bit disruptive when you need to erase a lot. Excalidraw is the only web-bases solution i know which recognizes buttons on Windows, but not on IOS, and Its performance  seems to be quite bad on the iPad in general.</p>

<p>By the way, MS Whiteboard seems to do the job, but sadly, both our universities' MS 365 subscriptions only allow sharing with people within your university...  <br>
I would prefer an open source solution if there is one that works really well, but at this point, I would go with anything that has the desired features.</p>

<p>I know Xournal++ and used it for my own notes in the past. (Now I switched to <a href="https://www.styluslabs.com/">Stylus Labs Write</a> for that purpose) The problem is that, as far as I know, Xournal++ doesn't have a real-time collaboration feature. Write does have one, but it is very unstable.</p>

<p>No, I haven't tried yet. It seemed to be quite a bit of an effort as it uses ports which are blocked by my universty's VPN I'm normally working behind, so i can't just run the server on my laptop. I might try running it on a separate computer, however.</p>

<p>Scribble together was the best solution I tried before: <a href="https://scribbletogether.com/">https://scribbletogether.com/</a>.</p>
<p>Possible drawbacks: the tools are rather basic especially compared to say Goodnotes, I’m not sure if they still have a way to test it without paying, and I don’t know what the support for windows look like (on the iPad side I thought it was quite good).</p>

<p>OK, I checked miro again, and there also is an app that I overlooked when I checked it the first time (I only tested the web version). The app seems to work quite fine on Windows, and although I find the UI a bit strange, I guess I can get used to it.</p>

But the problem with both Whiteboard Fox and miro, as with most web-based solutions, is that they don't recognize pen buttons, which is a bit disruptive when you need to erase a lot. </p>

<p>I implemented a <a href="https://amblafont.github.io/graph-editor/index.html">diagram editor</a> with collaborative features that I use with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="383799">@Tom Hirschowitz</span> when we meet online. There is a test server running if you want to give it a try: see <a href="https://github.com/amblafont/yade-server/blob/main/README.md">here</a> for some instructions</p>

<p>I have never been a power user, so I am really sad that your editor is not based on the interface of quiver, in terms of UX I mean. It was easy to switch from <a href="https://tikzcd.yichuanshen.de/">https://tikzcd.yichuanshen.de/</a> to <a href="https://q.uiver.app/">https://q.uiver.app/</a> because both used similar interfaces. Unfortunately, I don't see myself learning to use your editor even for this amazing feature (or the   built-in automatic prover).</p>

<p>There are other really nice features (covered by the tutorial), which ease the incremental construction of diagrams considerably. E.g., if you find yourself missing some space in some part of the diagram, you can ‘stretch’ it.</p>

<p>One other thing I like (in Ambroise's editor) is the ability to copy-paste diagrams.</p>
