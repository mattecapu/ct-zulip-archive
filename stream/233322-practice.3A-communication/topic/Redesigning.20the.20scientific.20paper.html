<p>I've actually seen this <a href="http://worrydream.com/ScientificCommunicationAsSequentialArt/" title="http://worrydream.com/ScientificCommunicationAsSequentialArt/">"graphic novel" version</a> of <em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/30918" title="https://www.nature.com/articles/30918">Collective dynamics of ‘small-world’ networks</a></em> by Watts and Strogatz. Here's Strogatz's reaction to the re-design:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Strogatz admired Victor’s design. He later told me that it was a shame that in mathematics it’s been a tradition for hundreds of years to make papers as formal and austere as possible, often suppressing the very visual aids that mathematicians use to make their discoveries.</p>

<p>I think it's a shame this paper rolls away on a total biographical tangent. The conclusion is just "we should use computational notebooks", which I guess is an upgrade on pdf in some respects but it's hardly a massive leap of creativity away from the format the writer is claiming is obsolete.</p>

<p>Suppression of images is not just laziness, it's also page limit (esp. in conference submission). I guess a limit of 12 pages is fine for people working with "standard" mathematics, but try to let a paper about string diagrams fit within that limit...</p>

<p>Okay, but a page limit is not really a problem with the medium, which is what is being denounced as obsolete, it's a problem with the system for publication. Which, based on the other topic in this stream, is a much bigger problem!</p>

<p>This seems like a good opportunity to put forward my own idea of how this could work, at least for mathematics as a highly structured subject of research. The "traditional internet format" suffers from many the same restrictions that pdfs do. There's greater scope for interaction, but most pages about scientific subject matter largely consist of text blocks with static pictures or diagrams. If one is lucky the page author will have the facilities to format equations nicely. In a well-maintained online project (such as a community wiki) content may be well-connected in the sense that technical terms and names link to relevant other pages, and if one is really lucky the contents will be searchable...<br>
The most glaring thing that's absent from this format (imo) is the visibility of structure. Text and pictures will, for the foreseeable future, be the most convenient final delivery method of detailed information, but there are things about a subject I should be able to understand without having to comb through these details. I imagine a network structure, a virtual map of a subject, with nodes linking to, say, entries in a wiki. At a finer level, one could construct networks based on the results presented in a given textbooks, <em>expanding them with results that have been discovered since the book's publication</em>.</p>

<p>If implemented in a serious way, this could give:</p>
<ol>
<li>A visual way to understand the structure of a subject, which immediately makes visible the cutting edge and open questions which normally are only known to specialised researchers. (it wouldn't give immediate comprehension of the statements of these problems; just where they lie in the grand scheme of things)</li>
<li>A direct visual link between abstraction and concreteness.</li>
<li>Connections between researchers who didn't realise that they were working in parallel on the same thing due to different naming conventions etc. (this is sort of a Yoneda ideology: if two areas of research connect to the same things they should be related)</li>
<li>A way to keep track of updates to older publications, and see how they connect to more recent research.</li>
<li>Eventually, a breakdown of long, intimidating publications into pieces made manageable by their connections to other resources. </li>
<li>Potential to gain credit for regular small contributions to a project. Being part of a community wiki is great, but actually being able to <em>see</em> how much someone has contributed to a network visually could be a lot more persuasive than a number like reputation.</li>

<p>A lot of research goes into visualisation of knowledge every year (I should put a source here but I need to get back to "real work"). The problem is that it's specialised: one has to learn to use the tools that are being constructed, and that's a big enough obstacle that only a tiny fraction of it reaches mainstream. As soon as the sharing of ideas in a visually structured way becomes as easy as contributing to a community wiki or a stackexchange page, what I've described will become the next generation of those, I'm confident of it.</p>

<p>At this point, I find this kind of discussion a bit useless. I do not say acrimoniously, but from a personal experience point of view. All of us have ideas about what could be improved or not, and we could talk endlessly about this. For a time, Statebox wanted to really collaborate on creating a journal which would improve the current workflow in many ways. We discussed about this endlessly, how it should or should not look. We also got the endorsement of Mathematica so that we could naively support jupiter and mathematica computational notebooks to make the publication format more expressive. We even travelled all the way to London to meet other researchers (<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277670">@Philipp Zahn</span>  and Andrew Lewis-Pye) in person to discuss this further, and get backed up by the LSE in the process. Well, guess what? It went nowhere. And the reason for this is that, all things considered, no one among anyone of us had the time you'd need to put into such a project. This kind of stuff, done the right way, is a thousands man hours project. So if we really want to change how the academic workflows are implemented, the first thing would be making sure we have people on board that can literally work on this fulltime. <span aria-label="slight smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="slight smile">:slight_smile:</span></p>

<p>I mean, I see a similar pattern with Compositionality. I submitted there ages ago, got reviews, made the requested edits, and never heard from them again. But I don't blame them. Managing a journal is an extremely difficult and time consuming project, especially if it happens on a volountary basis. It''s literally people giving away their time to read your stuff and evaluate it. We were just getting started with bootstrapping a journal and gave up.

<p>This is actually quite meaningful in CS, because you can <em>run code</em> from within your document. When we eventually gain the ability to run proofs on our computers, the notebook would probably become more compelling as a format.

<p>This is actually quite doable. I've mentioned something like a Github equivalent for maths. What the arXiv is, currently, is a repository system with version control, which is also what Github has. What arXiv is missing, however, is precisely what you're asking for here. </p>
<p>Github has all these:</p>
<ul>
<li>It allows you to raise "Issues", which are basically complaints about things not working. </li>
<li>It has "pull requests", which is a way for people to contribute amendments to the code in a repository.  You, the owner(s) of the repository, then review the submissions, and approve ("merge") changes accordingly.</li>
<li>Users have a dashboard on their profile that shows visually their contributions throughout time.</li>
</ul>
<p>So all you need to do is to add these Github features onto the arXiv. Simples. <span aria-label="sweat smile" class="emoji emoji-1f605" role="img" title="sweat smile">:sweat_smile:</span></p>

<p>You need better NLP and more code-like or modular mathematical writing. However, modularity isn't well supported under the current system, because you want to bundle results together to form a "publishable" and "substantial" paper. It may work once you have arXiv+Github in place.</p>

<p>Right, this is the "content ignorant" version of that feature.

<p>That's a connection between two fields. Elliptic curves and modular forms were previously separate fields, but then people found some connectivity between the two. It's not really a generalisation, more the realisation that there's a bridge. Passing from Taylor-Wiles to the full modularity theorem is a generalisation, but it wouldn't appear as an emergent connectivity.</p>

<p>You need NLP for that "structural scaffolding". </p>
<p>It's not as bad as it sounds, really. That's something that the NLP side of ACT can work on, if they're keen. There is prior art: I'll elaborate in another comment.</p>

<p>You'd be surprised at how often people independently come up with the same thing. <em>And</em> sometimes they use the <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2020/03/31/structured-cospans-and-double-categories/" title="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2020/03/31/structured-cospans-and-double-categories/">same naming convention</a>! It's crazy, I know.</p>
<p>Story time: I encountered this very problem with my thesis, and it was a really <em>fun</em> time.</p>
<p>So I had come up with this really weird gadget that my advisor had an idea for, based on something that someone had told him about in a conference. Now I was pretty sure I wasn't <em>that</em> smart to have been the first one to come up with it, so I took to the Googles and search the heck out of it. No dice. </p>
<p>There was a tiny problem: the name that I had come up with had a Greek letter in it, and for the life of me, I couldn't figure out how to get Google to accept the Greek letter as a keyword, which I was absolutely positive that anyone who came up with the same thing would have used.</p>
<p>Long story short, I didn't manage to figure out that someone else had already come up with the same thing before I submitted. Thankfully, nobody else knew about it because it was in a completely different field, but it took me a few years before I discovered the probable source of the notion that my advisor had heard. </p>
<p>As it turned out, <em>two</em> other people had come up with the same thing, using the same naming convention, but in wildly different fields! So yeah, point 3 here is a major problem.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>So I promised I'd talk about the prior art I know of in this problem.</p>
<p>The problem is being able to process the natural-language material found in maths papers into some sort of network of concepts. One prerequisite for that is to be able to parse mathematics written in a natural language. Some of it has been done before.</p>
<p>Back in 2013 --- 2012/13 was pretty hectic in maths --- Tim Gowers ran a curious experiment on his blog and posted the results <a href="https://gowers.wordpress.com/2013/04/14/answers-results-of-polls-and-a-brief-description-of-the-program/" title="https://gowers.wordpress.com/2013/04/14/answers-results-of-polls-and-a-brief-description-of-the-program/">here</a>. It turned out to be a demo of some software written by Mohan Ganesalingam to test that his grammar of mathematics, which he developed in his <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783642370113" title="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783642370113">thesis</a>, actually works. They eventually published the results <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10817-016-9377-1" title="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10817-016-9377-1">here</a>.</p>
<p>The point isn't that we can now look forward to automated theorem provers writing really convincing natural-language proofs. Rather, it's that there has been a prototype that can generate natural-language proofs, which <em>presumably</em> means it may also "understand" natural-language proofs, in such a way that it may be possible to extract concepts and do something useful with them.</p>

<p>All of this requires natural language processing (NLP). Unless your system is going to be manual, which is then the status quo, it will require more NLP than what we can currently do at the moment, as far as I'm aware.</p>
<p>The description was very clear... to a human. It's also very clear that you can't have a non-manual system to do that without better NLP. </p>
<p>I mean, I'm not trying to be pessimistic here. I'm actually excited. This is a lot of work that ACT can do. And if you can push NLP to this point, it's likely you can have commercial spin-offs.</p>

<p>No, very much not! I can't currently see the structure I've described, and it certainly isn't central to the system. The automated aspect is just to get the system up to speed with existing research, so that people don't have to manually reproduce work they've done before.

<p>This requires NLP. It seems I cannot reiterate that enough. </p>

<p>There's some tension between us here, and I think this might be the source of it. The purpose of research papers is to communicate research <strong>to humans</strong>. The system I described above aims to do exactly this: make the structure of research more visible to people. I frankly don't care how able a computer is to read my research papers, or whether it can analyse the resulting network in order to identify the open problems; I care about helping people to do these things and avoiding exactly the kind of anecdote you shared above, for example.<br>
As you've pointed out, the technology already exists to produce citation trees; it's not perfect, but that's a sufficient level of NLP to produce the initial scaffolding that we've been talking about. Anything further is a bonus, for the same reasons that improved NLP gives better search engine results, but it's not essential to get the system up and running.</p>

<p>I wouldn't define it "limbo". They asked me to resubmit with corrections, so I guess they more or less liked the paper. They gave me a very long and detailed list of things to revise/change, which I appreciated, clearly reviews were well-done. This happened last august I believe. I managed to implement the corrections in December, and resubmitted including a file where I said, for each correction, if I had implemented it and, if I didn't, why I chose to do that. I didn't hear back from them ever since. Then today, exactly because of this conversation, I sent a mail to them asking for news. Dan Ghica almost instantly replied to me that reviewers are reviewing the corrections, and that the process "should be swift" ...I hope he's right!</p>

<p>I was sketching my vision of what I would like an alternative to scientific papers to look like, and we just happen to disagree about what that would involve to implement <span aria-label="shrug" class="emoji emoji-1f937" role="img" title="shrug">:shrug:</span>. In order to upload a preprint, you go to arXiv and upload it. In the most basic version of the system I was trying to describe you add a node to a network instead; this idea, as stated, does not require computer-implemented NLP.<br>
I agreed that some automation would be needed to set up the initial network, but the reason I would be satisfied with the existing NLP models for this task is that it wouldn't be the final network; this would just provide an initial geometry for the network, to be subsequently modified by the users of said network. Perhaps it was optimistic to hope that my suggestion 5 would ever be feasible manually, but otherwise the mere existence of a visible network of this kind with active users seems to me to achieve all of the points I gave.</p>

<p>Again, I really do not want to sound hostile, I am not and I appreciate this idea. But it's just enriching a bucket full of resources of which we already have plenty. This kind of discussion is a bit of a trap: It's very interesting for everyone on a superficial level, but it's really very difficult to let it take off from there. This is why I said above that I find this discussions not useful anymore. In the end, it all runs down to wanting to do something and not having resources to do it, and hence, sadly, it ends up being more whishful thinking than anything else <span aria-label="frown" class="emoji emoji-1f641" role="img" title="frown">:frown:</span></p>

<p>github as a model has a big problem: issues, pull requests, and forks are not part of the git repository, but proprietary to the service. gitlab and other git hosting services have their own implementations of these features, and while i believe there is decent transport between these services (developers would riot otherwise), ideally you would want issues and prs to be versioned and stored alongside a repository (i bet there are extensions for this, but they might not interface natively with a hosting service).</p>
<p>i wouldn't be surprised if these were implemented as either separate repositories or extensions to the hosted repository on the backend, that are nevertheless not sent when you clone a github repo. i imagine communication and coordination workflow was not included in the repository because it didn't fit into the use of git as versioning a specific directory, and git does not support partial checkouts/fetches very well.</p>

<p>To build a decentralized version of Github with decentralized bug features you'd need all the data behind the issue databases to be published as LinkedData and to write Apps that can read those too.

<p>The idea I'd proposed was to layer the non-git features of git hosting services onto arXiv, which has some version control built in. Unfortunately, what you've brought up seems to suggest that this idea would suffer from the same problems as the existing git hosting services, unless this extension is developed as an integral part of arXiv.</p>

<p>I was thinking with this there's broadly 2 different approaches that are at risk of talking across each other [why is it always me that recognises that kind of situation?]. Broadly they are about human-readable vs machine-readable metadata. Both reasonable, but different. (The second one is hard, on the basis that semantic web is hard)</p>

But Rongmin made me conscious of the fact that the sheer volume of existing research is such that automated machine-readability is necessary in order for the revolution to happen. Without it, the foundation off which people are supposed to build would need to be produced manually, which is not only a mammoth task but one which any person or community would struggle to handle in a systematic, reliable way.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>As you've said, creating machine-readable metadata is hard like the semantic web is hard. It requires quite a bit of hand-crafting and a lot of manual labelling. </p>
<p>So my point was basically that we should learn to process the human-readable data we already have directly and automatically, i.e. develop better natural language processing (NLP) technology. The state of the art in NLP now is better than when Ganesalingam wrote his thesis, and there have been steps taken towards processing mathematical text as well.</p>
<p>Where I think ACT can come in is to provide a better framework for the engineers to design better. Right now, to use an analogy with engineering and physics, people know how to build bridges that wouldn't collapse when someone walks on it, but there's no theory of mechanics yet to guide the engineers on how to build better bridges. </p>
<p>There are embryonic theories, like Bob Coecke's DisCoCats(Circs) and the work sparked by <em>Backprop as Functor</em>. My hope is that these could blossom into some coherent theory that would help guide future work in ML/NLP.</p>

<p>What I don't liked is that the author seemingly oversees that if you were to turn papers into computing notebooks, that would mean scientists would have to decide on a language. The "what programming language is the best" does not have an answer, as we know from 80 years of computing.<br>
And I don't see "too formal" as an issue. It depends on the subject.<br>
And I agree with Morgan Rogers point that I was hoping for something more radical going in. <br>
In fact, the article leaves me with a discouraged feel in this regard, since the presentation and biographical details makes one conclude that to change something, it needs a highjacking of ones own career and a tangent of 20 years. Probably what Fabrizio is also getting at later.<br>

<p>However, we already have the arXiv as a document repository. The thing is, we'd like it to do more. Much more.</p>

<p>This doesn’t count as a ”redesign of the scientific paper” but nonetheless seems relevant here: I’m thinking about document creation/structure, and the interface we use to do it. One thing I’ve been surprised at is how far behind being a “good, intuitive text editor for math” most LaTeX editors are. For a while I’ve used TeXmacs ( <a href="https://www.texmacs.org">https://www.texmacs.org</a> ), which, while it allows LaTeX-like input of math symbols, is a different document structure built (at least in large part) on a Scheme base. It’s a what-you-see-is-what-you-get, it’s got (mostly) easily learnable keyboard shortcuts (hit tab a couple times from similar symbols, for instance), it has plugins for CAS and interactive in-document coding sessions, has a graphical interface for diagram drawing, and best of all, it’s GNU-licensed/open-source. It’s not perfect, but I like to characterize it as the closest thing I’ve seen to a modern mathematical text editor.</p>

<p>? TeXmacs lets you input mathematical text much more easily and reliably than writing raw LaTeX; there’s a lot of user-interface ground to cover between writing LaTeX and just scribbling on our devices. (Unless I’ve misunderstood the point you were trying to make?)</p>

<p>Yeah, I'm actually saying I want that. TeXmacs, as good as it is, is still old-school stuff, like Word. And you're right that there's a lot of UI stuff to cover as well. NLP stuff too, plus the use of symbols in mathematical writing is highly... "creative".</p>

<p>Just popped back in to say: we already have that. It's called an <em>abstract</em>, and I can't tell you how many times I've seen an abstract that bears only a passing resemblance to the paper it's supposed to summarise. This is one reason why I'm not in favour of authors hand-coding metadata: I don't trust them to give me clean data.</p>

<p>ah, I see! (I thought you were just being sarcastic :P )</p>
<p>a random thought about document creation, btw: I think the formats in which we write papers and read documents ought to be interchangeable. Maybe not exactly the same; maybe you want some more stuff exposed while you’re editing, and you want to present a cleaner version to an audience. But a reader ought to be able to choose to edit your document and expose all that stuff if they want—maybe by changing the extension or changing something in the document’s metadata, or simply by opening it differently.</p>
<p>I feel like this gives the structure of the document greater relevance, and so greater possible use (or something)—and makes our tools coincide, so we don’t have to build one thing and convert to another. It might make adding custom functionalities easier and more widespread...in an imaginary document format where adding functionalities to the document (like interactive sessions/visualizations) is already doable and easy, ofc. :) (You can write stuff like this for TeXmacs, but afaik it’s not exactly easy!)</p>
<p>In general, I think some of the different things being talked about in this topic might “coevolve” and help each other along, and that it would be harder to instead add them piecemeal or in sequence to the current state of affairs. Idk—just a speculation.</p>

<p>Just popped back in to say: we already have that. It's called an <em>abstract</em>, and I can't tell you how many times I've seen an abstract that bears only a passing resemblance to the paper it's supposed to summarise. This is one reason why I'm not in favour of authors hand-coding metadata: I don't trust them to give me clean data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I feel what you're saying... but taking things to that level of cynicism undermines the entire edifice of scientific discourse.</p>
<p>My opinion is that scientific papers are––on the whole––credible. It's just that they conceal too much of their logic and rhetoric. All of modern science is based on the same adversarial learning system that analytic philosophy and western law is also based on––a defeasible mode of inquiry unlike mathematics. However, many bodies of literature make it hard to process and recombine arguments from different sources because scientists aspire to be like mathematicians who conceal their problem-solving-based arguments in favor of neatly packaged results (theorems, corollaries, etc.). Unfortunately, this just leads to a mess in science because scientific results are defeasible rather than (contingently) immutable.</p>
<p>Whenever possible, I already code papers of interest using the schemes I know (though I'm working on expanding my repertoire into statistical arguments––which would be a lot more useful). It works pretty well as a knowledge management strategy. It's not perfect, but nothing is.</p>

<p>Yes. Walton's schemes are geared towards old school rhetoric and law right now, but I think the overall idea has a lot of potential. In particular, I think schematizing (1) statistical tests (2) common causal arguments (3) common arguments by constraint / other scientific arguments a la Walton could be useful.</p>

<p>Have you not heard of citations?</p>
<p>Granted, most citations are justifiable, but appeals to authority need not always be fallacies. They are just defeasible arguments, and the point of Walton's work was to point out how these arguments can be defeated. </p>
<p>The same goes for citations. We've all seen spurious citations, or citations to three volumes of a work without specifying the page numbers or the volume being referred to, etc, etc. Sometimes Referee 2 will demand that you cite the (sometimes spurious) references they've supplied in their report before they would concede to the publication of your manuscript.  And I've actually seen (recent!) maths stuff in which references to "a famous theorem" are made without actual citations!</p>

<p>You're right, it does read like I was being sarcastic, but I was merely being playful. This thread is for blue-sky ideas, not incremental ones, so I'm trying to push the envelope by proposing lofty goals like this.</p>

<p>You can do wikis, and I think the <a href="https://asone.ai/polymath/index.php?title=Main_Page">polymath project</a> is an example of this. However, the academic system rewards individualistic efforts, at least in mathematics, so most people doing maths academically are rather attached to the idea that their work is their own for this idea to take off. </p>
<p>(NB: I'm not saying collaborations don't exist. It's just that even in those massive polymath projects, the people writing up the results and, hence, being credited for it are few in number.)</p>

<p>I feel what you're saying... but taking things to that level of cynicism undermines the entire edifice of scientific discourse. My opinion is that scientific papers are––on the whole––credible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the contrary, scientific discourse is being undermined because people are not being critical enough. You've surely heard of the replication crisis. Peer review is also broken because many professors farm out the work to their students, who are usually not in the best position to evaluate the manuscript confronting them. Yes, it's a convenient way to train students, who'd surely benefit from the work. However, it also shows how, when you don't have adequate incentives (peer review is generally unpaid work), people give peer review work a much lower priority than appropriate.</p>
<p>As for abstracts, people have all sorts of reasons for producing abstracts that are inaccurate, ranging from innocent misunderstandings of their own work through to bad faith. The point is, it's hard to tell <em>what</em> led to that inaccuracy, and I want to take the guesswork out of it. I would rather we have an open-source algorithm producing the abstract and metadata, because I can at least interrogate the algorithm without a lot of hassle.</p>

<p>All of modern science is based on the same adversarial learning system that analytic philosophy and western law is also based on––a defeasible mode of inquiry unlike mathematics. [...] scientific results are defeasible rather than (contingently) immutable.</p>

<p>Oh boy! You'd love <a href="#narrow/stream/229111-general/topic/CS.20and.20Math%28s%29/near/192924143">this comment</a>. Settle down with a nice beverage and brace yourself. I can wait.</p>
<p>Scientific results are defeasible because they rely on inductive reasoning, which reasons backwards from effects to causes: if you are ignorant of a cause, you may be misattributing an effect to an erroneous cause. Mathematical results appear to be less defeasible because they reason forward from hypotheses to conclusions using deductive reasoning. </p>
<p>However, the assurance of that indefeasibility of mathematical results rest upon the very adversarial learning system that you claimed mathematics is, somehow, not based on. As you may have inferred from my complaint about peer review, the adversarial system that peer review is ostensibly supposed to be is not working properly these days, and that is a problem.</p>

<p>I feel what you're saying... but taking things to that level of cynicism undermines the entire edifice of scientific discourse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's another reason why this is actually realism, not cynicism: we've done this experiment before with web documents. There is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_element">metadata</a> in HTML documents that search engines read, and people have used the meta elements to do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization">search engine optimisation (SEO)</a> to boost their rankings in search results. </p>
<p>You can do SEO in a variety of ways though: you can write really informative content, or you can just stuff the <code>keyword</code> attribute of meta elements with your desired keywords. In the early days of the Web, many people do the latter, and users were bombarded with a lot of useless results. More recently, Google has cracked down a lot on the latter to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, so that people are now forced to supply useful relevant content.</p>
<p>Right now, there is also a lot of noise in scientific research, c.f. the replication crisis and <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">p</span></span></span></span>-hacking. Hence, it would be counter-productive to introduce more noise by requiring metadata, because people can then hack that metadata to boost the visibility of their results. They have every incentive to do so, because getting ahead in their academic careers depends on gaining visibility.</p>

<p>Granted, most citations are justifiable, but appeals to authority need not always be fallacies. They are just defeasible arguments, and the point of Walton's work was to point out how these arguments can be defeated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, any good paper should contain some motivation, which may include arguments for why a particular problem is worth looking at, of which some may be of the form "here are some influential people who care about this".  They should also contain relevant background material, which may include non-specific references. But these arguments should be independent of the scientific content of the paper. </p>
<p>There is a more philosophical aspect to "citations as appeals to authority", though, in that no one has time to check them all. Thus any quoted result from another author (or the same author) that goes unchecked must be accepted on the basis of that author's authority alone. It's like second hand stories, or second hand evidence... If too many reported results get changed together, the literature can get very difficult to stay on top of.<br>
Another nice thing about building a meta-literary structure would be that cited results become "gluing points", and any 'real' appeals to authority are revealed as arguments which fail to be well-founded in this structure. And one could even find a shortest path from familiar (accepted) material and results to desired results, following only paths containing acceptable methods of proof.... <span aria-label="robot" class="emoji emoji-1f916" role="img" title="robot">:robot:</span></p>

<p>I mean... that's kind of like saying "time poor researchers will not be bothered to learn rigorous mathematical thinking" or "time poor researchers will not be bothered to learn to actually understand statistical tests so we might as well give up on advocating that people think that way." Argument schemes aren't the kind of thing machines can reliably identify in natural language. Also, even if there was a way to <em>unreliably</em> code papers with argument schemes, that wouldn't necessarily reflect the author's intent. It would reflect the distorted opinion––in the hyper-abstract––of the theorist who developed the method that the machine learning engineer interpreted and implemented. The two main reasons for asking people to label their arguments is (1) to get people to think about what they are arguing / address <em>more</em> critical questions / openly highlight the loose ends; and (2) to gather information about authors' intent. Neither of these goals is accomplished by a purely machine learning solution. Maybe in the future, AI can assist us in <em>using</em> argument schemes––just like CAS systems help us use numerical methods.</p>
<p>The NLP for argument schemes idea could become useful for lit reviews, but only if people actually adopt the convention of using them first. So even in that case, that project would need a base of people who know how to do this stuff by hand. By analogy, if we didn't teach people arithmetic, and make them practice a lot, all the data scientists would disappear.</p>
<p>I think the way to go is to use the method, gain a demonstrable advantage, then tell people how you did it and encourage them to copy you. That would serve both goals.</p>

<p>Ok this is a fair criticism of my loose rhetoric. What I meant to say is that mathematics can get away with being abstruse about its arguments because––once a result is proven––all the 'argument schemes' in mathematics can collapse to 'by proof...such and such is true'. And––if the result has truly been proven––under the assumptions for the proof, there are no further critical questions. This means mathematicians can string together results without thinking too hard about how they got them. It could have been a beautiful explanatory proof, a convoluted pedantic proof or computer generated gobbeldy-gook. A proof is a proof is a proof.</p>

<p>Oh boy! You'd love <a href="#narrow/stream/229111-general/topic/CS.20and.20Math%28s%29/near/192924143">this comment</a>. Settle down with a nice beverage and brace yourself. I can wait.</p>
<p>Scientific results are defeasible because they rely on inductive reasoning, which reasons backwards from effects to causes: if you are ignorant of a cause, you may be misattributing an effect to an erroneous cause. Mathematical results appear to be less defeasible because they reason forward from hypotheses to conclusions using deductive reasoning. </p>
<p>However, the assurance of that indefeasibility of mathematical results rest upon the very adversarial learning system that you claimed mathematics is, somehow, not based on. As you may have inferred from my complaint about peer review, the adversarial system that peer review is ostensibly supposed to be is not working properly these days, and that is a problem.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, totally fair criticism of my loose language. I have a taxonomy in my head that I didn't lay out. In it, mathematics also shares a common ancestor with science, analytic philosophy and western law. It's just that the split goes back further. Mathematics has the nice closure that I mentioned above, whereas these other disciplines do not.</p>
<p>My main point was––as I mentioned––that scientists need to account for the fact that their reasoning is defeasible (though not necessarily inductive). </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scientific results are defeasible because they rely on inductive reasoning, which reasons backwards from effects to causes: if you are ignorant of a cause, you may be misattributing an effect to an erroneous cause. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This presupposes that your starting ontology is correct. It also presupposes that you have a coherent notion of causes in the domain in question. I don't think we can take either of these things for granted in science. It also presupposes that your choice of model is correct. Scientific induction (usually in the form of statistical tests) stand on top of a whole bunch of other reasoning that isn't inductive at all. It really depends on the field, the level of analysis, etc. Still, we agree on the main point–– that science is defeasible.</p>

<p>It's called an <em>abstract</em>, and I can't tell you how many times I've seen an abstract that bears only a passing resemblance to the paper it's supposed to summarise. This is one reason why I'm not in favour of authors hand-coding metadata: I don't trust them to give me clean data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I feel what you're saying... but taking things to that level of cynicism undermines the entire edifice of scientific discourse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's another reason why this is actually realism, not cynicism: we've done this experiment before with web documents. There is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_element">metadata</a> in HTML documents that search engines read, and people have used the meta elements to do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization">search engine optimisation (SEO)</a> to boost their rankings in search results. </p>
<p>You can do SEO in a variety of ways though: you can write really informative content, or you can just stuff the <code>keyword</code> attribute of meta elements with your desired keywords. In the early days of the Web, many people do the latter, and users were bombarded with a lot of useless results. More recently, Google has cracked down a lot on the latter to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, so that people are now forced to supply useful relevant content.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a fair point. However, I'm having a hard time thinking of how the label "argument by [insert scheme here]" could be abused for search optimization in a way that would add much to the abuses related to tagging and keywords. The number of useful known schemes is likely in the low hundreds, so it's a finite and repetitive set. They have no bearing on topical relevance, so search relevance hacking would be hard.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Right now, there is also a lot of noise in scientific research, c.f. the replication crisis and <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">p</span></span></span></span>-hacking. Hence, it would be counter-productive to introduce more noise by requiring metadata, because people can then hack that metadata to boost the visibility of their results. They have every incentive to do so, because getting ahead in their academic careers depends on gaining visibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for the reproducibility crisis and p-hacking (which you also mentioned elsewhere). This is one of the main reasons why I like argumentation schemes. I wish that statistical tests were presented in the form of formal arguments and labeled schemes so that people could detect fishy rhetoric. While this would not directly address p-hacking, the it's <em>probably</em> fair to say that––often––the kinds of people who p-hack are the kinds of people who use sketchy or lazy reasoning. If the rhetoric was brought to the center, peoples critical thinking skills would kick in more. Non-statisticians could catch many errors that only experts currently see.</p>
<p>Also, let's be honest, a lot of the research claiming to 'debunk' whole disciplines relies fishy interpretations of the original studies. Very little attention gets paid to the competence of debunkers' interpretation of the experimental procedures they try to reproduce. Both parties would benefit from making their arguments were more explicit. Researchers could convey the most important parts of their research in a way that would allow replicators to correctly identify the crux of their experimental designs; and replicators would be constrained to justify their choices when attempting to reproduce the work.</p>

<p>So there may be some ambiguity in this criterion, because I can see that "arguments which fail to be well-founded in this structure" can include some of the instances of citations I've listed above. While we'd like to sieve out the spurious ones, should we also filter those that may be considered as valid background material, yet have contributed nothing to the arguments in the contents of the current paper, except for being a mere "gluing point" in the meta-literary structure?</p>
<p>The shortest path problem is probably a nice problem to solve, as I find myself asking the same question when I do a literature review.</p>

<p>I think it's a great idea to train people to use argument schemes for their own private refinements of their thought.

<p>RIght, that's a fair point, especially when appeals to authority actually buttress an argument.</p>
<p>Here's a case that should be of interest to you: the argument that artificial neural networks (ANNs) are of little relevance in the study of neuroscience.</p>
<p>This argument was advanced by Francis Crick in a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/337129a0">1989 polemic in Nature</a> and held sway for a very long time. The justification was that the power of ANNs came from backpropagation, which cannot exist in a biological neural network because neurons can only fire in one direction. That argument is defeasible, because it turns out that we weren't aware at the time of the function of glia and other components and processes in the brain's network to produce effects similar to backpropagation. There are now various "biologically plausible" theories of backpropagation, and Fong et al's Backprop as Functor shows that backpropagation is a mathematical necessity for the composition of neural networks to happen, which reflects the fact that ANNs only became powerful and exciting when backpropagation was implemented.</p>

<p>I think my argument wasn't clear there. The point was that labelling was a cheap way to organise information when the search capability wasn't sophisticated enough. It was only in recent years that Google started penalising web documents for not having meaningful content, and promoted those that do, which presumably requires a lot more sophisticated NLP tech than what was available in previous decades.</p>
<p>In the case of argument schemes, it's not very informative to just put labels saying such and such an argument was used here. The metadata should probably include the structure of the arguments in the paper and the corresponding classifying labels, which a crawler would then extract and feed into the search engine's database. </p>
<p>If you let authors hand-code their own metadata, they could introduce errors because of their own misapprehension of what they've done. This routinely happens: people can miss something in their work that may seem obvious to outsiders, or their perceived perception of the significance of their work may differ from outsiders. A historical example is that Newton reportedly thought his theological work concerning the apocalypse was more important than his calculus!</p>

<p>That shouldn't detract from the fact that there's a systemic issue here: the dysfunction of the adversary in the adversarial system that we're supposed to have in academic research. I don't claim that the replication crisis is a justification for "debunking" entire disciplines, just that it's a systemic problem, one that will dog those disciplines and fuel political attacks for a long time.</p>
<p>However, there are certain schools of thought that need debunking, and people may have used the word "debunking" to highlight legitimate grave concerns. For example, the school of thought in economics known as "marginalism" historically, and "neoclassical economics" to its critics, is founded on many flawed <em>mathematical</em> premises which, many critics have argued, completely invalidates many of its conclusions and frameworks. </p>
<p>Yet, it is alleged, the prestigious journals in economics routinely reject papers that don't adhere to this school of thought, which is why people like Steve Keen have written books like <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debunking_Economics">Debunking Economics</a></em>. Now, Keen isn't debunking <em>his own</em> discipline: he's just criticising the dominant school of thought, and arguing for a better mathematical foundation for economics. </p>
<p>Of course, I'm biased here as I'm sympathetic to his work, but I think some of the "debunking" out there isn't necessarily done in bad faith simply because it comes across as hostile.</p>

<p>A less silly example is Leibniz style calculus where you do things like "divide through by dx", which is much easier to communicate and remember than any of the various ways of making it rigorous it, which can be quite obscure - want to teach first year engineers about tangent bundles?</p>

<p>You both are completely right. Period. I think I wasn't clear about what my argument was intended to convey. I was suggesting only that being familiar with a method––knowing <em>how</em> to do the essentials by hand––is a prerequisite for any automated assistance to even be useful. In fact, my–– and your––lack of fluency in argumentation schemes is precisely why these misapprehensions keep happening (even with my sporadic efforts to correct this deficit). I'm not following my own advice in the fast pace of a chat because I still haven't really built the foundations of thinking that way. The best I'm capable of right now is coding papers according to standards nobody taught me––very slowly. (Automating parts of my manual process would be very useful. Removing me from the process would probably just make me a worse thinker.)</p>
<p>So I'm not saying everybody should follow the exact same method. "Lack of rigor" as you both have interpreted it is certainly not always a disadvantage. However, I'm suggesting that, especially at this early stage of adoption, knowing and using argumentation schemes manually is more important than automating any one part of the process––just like knowing and using calculus is more important than automating its use (though that certainly is important at this late stage of wide adoption). I also think automating the whole process would defeat the purpose of using them. It would be just another way to generate reports that nobody is proficient enough to use well.</p>

<p>I don't think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentation_scheme">argumentation schemes</a> are anything new. What's missing here is the training needed to ensure widespread adoption amongst researchers, and the enforcement (that's supposed to come through peer review, but isn't) of best practices in publication.</p>
<p>What's <em>not</em> desirable, however, is to institute yet another checkbox that the researcher must tick, and manually at that, in order to get published. Researchers who already have training in argumentation will find this tedious and patently unnecessary. The point at which such training should take place is in the formative stage of a researcher's education, and NOT during the publication process, where the focus should instead be on enforcing those argumentation standards. This enforcement is perhaps best done with the aid of automation, because it's tedious and repetitive.</p>
<p>I understand that you have a pedagogical objective in mind, which is well and good, but it shouldn't involve making researchers code up metadata about argumentation schemes, because it's about as silly as asking people who routinely perform a lot of calculations in their daily work not to use a calculator or a spreadsheet.</p>

<p>Argument schemes aren't the kind of thing machines can reliably identify in natural language. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, as an old argument goes, you haven't really understood argument schemes yet, since you haven't succeeded in teaching them to machines.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, even if there was a way to <em>unreliably</em> code papers with argument schemes, that wouldn't necessarily reflect the author's intent. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's a reflection of the author's <em>degree of fallibility</em>. I think I've been clear in stating that I think the intent of the author is a red herring. The author being merely human --- and thus subject to various cognitive biases, which cannot be readily corrected by an external agent, that'd lead to unreliable coding --- is enough for my argument. This is why I'd prefer a machine, which plays the role of an independent agent in this situation, to do that coding.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The two main reasons for asking people to label their arguments [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think it's a great idea to train people to use argument schemes for their own private refinements of their thought. We could also advocate clearer writing styles that makes the schemes manifest, so that NLP tools can more easily infer these schemes from processing the papers. This is how to reduce the friction in the process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's fill out the context here:<br>
Between the two quotes you cited I said this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, even if there was a way to unreliably code papers with argument schemes, that wouldn't necessarily reflect the author's intent. It would reflect the distorted opinion––in the hyper-abstract––of the theorist who developed the method that the machine learning engineer interpreted and implemented. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly a machine isn't an "independent agent" just because it is a machine. Machines reflect the biases of those who code them and those who devise the methods used by those who code them. There is no such thing as an objective third party in the context of adversarial learning. The objective part comes in <em>after</em> scientists have built a quorum consensus about what an experiment or observation would mean––only then do results speak as the objective third party.</p>
<p>I think this point is really important in the question of how to use these tools because this misconception is a huge problem among technologists. We seriously need to stop letting people launder their opinions through algorithmic implementations (or mathematical models for that matter!). Clarifying what real scholars mean to say is the only way to converge on scientific conclusions. While it's true that the artful misinterpretation of others' ideas can be a great source of innovation, the only reason that works is because the new authors' intent improves on the old authors' intent. It still boils down to authors' intent.</p>
<p>In my view, any attempt to reform scientific rhetoric will be dead from the start if begin with this well-debunked premise from the old technocratic political movement. </p>
<p>On the other hand, I think it's great that you want to automate argumentation coding. I would certainly use and (if I can) contribute to such a project. I don't want to discourage it. I just want to convince you that if you don't convince people to <em>use the convention by hand</em>, there will be no cultural support, and your labor will be for naught. Just like a dead programming language.</p>

<p>So there may be some ambiguity in this criterion, because I can see that "arguments which fail to be well-founded in this structure" can include some of the instances of citations I've listed above.

<p>My short answer is yes: I don't want to eliminate that extra information, but I do want to separate it. I am of the opinion that the mathematical/formal scientific content should be separable from the pedagogical and philosophical content of a paper.<br>
I appreciate that this is an ideal that may not be perfectly achievable, however: the distinction between an axiom and an assertion about reality is a rather subtle one.</p>

<p>Some citation based arguments are of the form "you should believe my claim because this credible source said so" while others are of the form "you should check out this paper if you're unclear on this background idea". Both fit inside the framework. I don't think those background citations need to count as "extra information". Papers often convey many disjointed arguments.

<p>I bet it would be realistic to develop a few specialized tools to automate the process of using argument schemes. It might also be feasible to automate small parts of the coding process. For example, by developing special text search tools geared towards assisting manual coding. By the way----I think this is in Walton's Methods of Argumentation but I don't have the page number----they've done studies showing that human coding has a consistency score of 0.86, which is very high. That's promising both for the human adoption of these methods and for future NLP assistance.</p>

<p>Yes, for the simple reason that (in a way that argumentation schemes render explicit), defeasible arguments have the same structural form as formal logical/proof theoretic ones; they can be treated as extra principles of deduction.

<p><span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="277473">Morgan Rogers</span> is an admin, so he'd be all over this if there was an actual "fire" going on. That he hasn't yet told me off is enough evidence for me that this discussion is still pretty constructive.</p>
<p>It seems like this is a case of being "divided by a common language". Some expressions that are similar to "stoking the fire" in intent are "stirring things up" and "doing a hot take".

<p>This is the advantage I'm citing for a machine: I can interrogate the (open-source) algorithm it's running for biases with <em>far greater ease</em> than I can interrogate humans to understand what's going on between their ears. <br>

This means that trying to figure out what's going "wrong" in humans also involves reviewing a lifetime of "data" (i.e. experiences) the humans have ingested. Such a review on a therapist's couch is far more difficult and expensive to do than inspecting the data you've fed an algorithm.</p>

<p>I just want to convince you that if you don't convince people to <em>use the convention by hand</em>, there will be no cultural support, and your labor will be for naught. Just like a dead programming language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I'm trying to inform you that there isn't, and won't be, any cultural support for your proposal either.</p>
<p>There is currently a program to formalise maths. Look up Kevin Buzzard and his projects. Homotopy type theory is also part of the story. The thing is, mathematicians like <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="275920">John Baez</span> have <em>zero</em> (zilch, nada) interest in writing maths in the more formal way demanded by the existing technology that's being used by the formalisation crowd. John wishes them well, but he will not actively participate in their effort because he believes he has better things to do. As far as I can tell, his view is typical of most research mathematicians.</p>
<p>The reason for such inertia is now clear to me. It's because such efforts are labour-intensive and don't appear to be particularly enlightening (i.e. intellectually rewarding) activities to the detractors. The same goes for manually encoding argumentation schemes: most mathematicians have acquired an informal understanding that is sufficient for all intents and purposes, and see no point in belabouring (what they believe to be) the obvious.</p>
<p>That is why my focus has been to improve the user experience, instead of convincing people to do something they clearly and justifiably see no value in doing. I don't deny that there is pedagogical value in educating future researchers about argumentation schemes, but you should not expect working researchers to submit to demands that add more friction to what is already a time-consuming and taxing process.</p>

<p>This was also one of the reasons that I was initially resistant to your arguments that NLP was a crucial/inevitable component in this reformation project: the requisite NLP developments lie outside both my skillset and personal interests, so my instinct was to want to avoid/dismiss them.

<p>Yeah, I care a lot about user experience, which is why I tried to word my proposal in a way that showed that I did.

<p>I think when the barriers come down, it'd just be a matter of plugging in the correct APIs, no "NLP mindset" required. The point is, the project would only make sense once the NLP is seamless. In the meantime, either wait, or see how you can help to build the theories that'd enable those NLP APIs to become a reality.</p>

<p>Here's another analogy for why a good user experience is important for adoption. Einstein's theory of relativity is crucial in computing the relativistic corrections that make GPS work. It is important that a person with a good scientific education be somewhat familiar with relativity, and for those who aspire to do physics, or require physics in their future work, to master relativity to some extent. That doesn't mean, however, that we have to require users to do those corrections by hand every time they need to use GPS. Otherwise, nobody would use a map app, satnav, or any other app that requires GPS, because there would be way less friction in using good old-fashioned paper maps.</p>

<p>I think a tool for automatically summarizing literature would be amazing. If I could personally specify what my priorities are and get coherent abstracts for use in my personal investigations, that would be a huge boon for anybody who has lit to write review. I just also think that the task of writing an abstract is sufficiently ambiguous that it makes sense to let the author determine what to highlight in that part of the document. You might disagree with the authors' choices, and that's where your tool could become useful. As a computer assisted qualitative analysis tool.</p>
<p>As for your point about an algorithm being open source. If the algorithm is for communal use, it might work for a community of computer scientists or applied mathematicians... but for everybody else... it would definitely be quite a hassle for them to  "<em>interrogate the algorithm without a lot of hassle</em>."</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I'm not disparaging open-source algorithms. I'm saying that using them to summarize other peoples' work for them, without their input, unnecessarily smuggles the opinions of the algorithms' designers into a process that already emphasizes the opinions of the authors themselves. If a "independent committee" wrote everybody's abstract, I would raise the same objection. This isn't about algorithms vs other forms of top-down management. It's about allowing authors to say what they think is important, even if some authors are incompetent or dishonest. The paper is right next to the abstract. The risk of dishonest authors involves you being annoyed they wasted your time when you skim the paper. The risk of removing authors from summarizing their own work is that you introduce systematic bias into the whole process. The same risk would apply to letting committees write abstracts. Reviewers already introduce enough systematic bias into that process. It just seems more useful to let readers use such a powerful class of algorithms to automate parts of the literature search.</p>

<p>Clearly I'm not an anti-technocrat. I knew enough about the obscure party to criticize the early movement. I'm all for many of their big ideas: giving priority to technical experts on technical issues, minimizing parochial politics on simple issues of infrastructure and sustenance, automating big swaths of unpleasant labor. My reason for citing the "old technocratic political movement" is because a lot of their prescriptions were un-workable top-down command methods that we now know simply do not work. A lot like an algorithm that puts words in authors' mouths. Great as a tool for individual use. Not so great as a way to reform scientific literature.</p>

<p>I just want to convince you that if you don't convince people to <em>use the convention by hand</em>, there will be no cultural support, and your labor will be for naught. Just like a dead programming language.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I'm trying to inform you that there isn't, and won't be, any cultural support for your proposal either.</p>
<p>There is currently a program to formalise maths. Look up Kevin Buzzard and his projects. Homotopy type theory is also part of the story. The thing is, mathematicians like <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="275920">John Baez</span> have <em>zero</em> (zilch, nada) interest in writing maths in the more formal way demanded by the existing technology that's being used by the formalisation crowd. John wishes them well, but he will not actively participate in their effort because he believes he has better things to do. As far as I can tell, his view is typical of most research mathematicians.</p>
<p>The reason for such inertia is now clear to me. It's because such efforts are labour-intensive and don't appear to be particularly enlightening (i.e. intellectually rewarding) activities to the detractors. The same goes for manually encoding argumentation schemes: most mathematicians have acquired an informal understanding that is sufficient for all intents and purposes, and see no point in belabouring (what they believe to be) the obvquote</p>

<p>As I understand it, people need to see that a method will give them a competitive advantage. Then some of them will adopt the method. If the method is sufficiently advantageous, it ends up being a game-theoretic invasive species. That's how something gets adopted. Maybe we're right and those of us who use these methods will gain a publishing advantage. Maybe we're wrong and we won't. If we're wrong, that's no skin off my nose. I'm wrong about lots of things that I try. If we're right, others will support the method eventually.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That is why my focus has been to improve the user experience, instead of convincing people to do something they clearly and justifiably see no value in doing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with the sentiment, but I disagree with the implementation. Maybe I'm misunderstanding you, but if I am perceiving your point correctly, you're saying we should make the tools more convenient so people adopt the method. If that is what you mean, here is my response:</p>
<p>I could be completely wrong about this, but it seems to me that trying create demand for a solution by increasing its supply won't work. My evidence is the graveyard of similar projects. It seems like the first step is to create demand by figuring out how to use a thing for personal gain. Then you share your notes and people crib your methods. (Or, if the advantage is <em>really big</em> you defend your "trade secret" for a while and people try even harder to replicate your methods).</p>
<p>If that isn't what you meant, ignore the response and explain what you actually meant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don't deny that there is pedagogical value in educating future researchers about argumentation schemes, but you should not expect working researchers to submit to demands that add more friction to what is already a time-consuming and taxing process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I never said I would ask researches to "submit to demands."  I doubt anybody in this community really takes that stance on anything. Which raises a question:</p>
<p>What can I do to interpret your arguments more charitably? The first thing I can think of is that I should ask more clarifying questions before refining or challenging a point I think you've made.</p>

<p>NLP is one of the most exciting applications of Category Theory. I'm totally into it.

<p>As for your point about an algorithm being open source.

</blockquote>
<p>The contention was that it's less of a hassle to interrogate an open-source algorithm than a human author, who may well have any number of reasons and excuses to be opaque. Presumably, the communities you've cited would be early adopters, and for everybody else, the adoption would come when they can interrogate the algorithm easily with some user-friendly interface. In any case, research labs routinely employ people to work on software that assists in research, and this could be something to keep them busy.</p>

<li>Emphasising the opinions of the authors means involving their opinions, but I see abstracts as objective summaries. </li>

<p>One way to give people a competitive advantage is to <em>save them time</em>, i.e. make a convenient solution, because all of us are time-poor: "valar morghulis" and all that jazz.

<p>In terms of writing abstracts, there's an active field of research called "abstractive summarisation". I found a summary of the state of the art ca. 2019 <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0957417418307735">here</a>. My impression is that there's a lot to be done, because we haven't yet figured out how to extract the semantics from a document effectively.</p>
<p>To that end, within category theory, there's work by <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="276692">Bob Coecke</span> and his school using CQM (categorical quantum mechanics) to encode semantics. There's a recent <a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/QNLP2019/">conference</a> to launch what they call QNLP. They've done a <a href="https://medium.com/cambridge-quantum-computing/quantum-natural-language-processing-748d6f27b31d">demonstration using a quantum computer</a> recently that Bob has talked about (Zulip thread <a href="#narrow/stream/229457-MIT-Categories.20Seminar/topic/May.207.20-.20Bob.20Coecke's.20talk">here</a>), but I think machine learning should do just fine as well: there is some evidence of deep neural networks exhibiting what appears to be quantum entanglement by <a href="https://www.cse.huji.ac.il/~yoavlevine/">Yoav Levine</a> and others (see also <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywXXwJAb">this paper</a> at <a href="http://OpenReview.net">OpenReview.net</a> for an example of how open peer review can take place).</p>
<p>As for informal maths, Mohan Ganesalingam has formalised a grammar of that in his <a href="https://academic.oup.com/philmat/article-abstract/25/1/143/2669621">thesis</a>, and he and Timothy Gowers did an <a href="https://gowers.wordpress.com/2013/04/14/answers-results-of-polls-and-a-brief-description-of-the-program/">experiment</a> using software written based on that grammar (paper <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10817-016-9377-1">here</a>).</p>

<p>I think we've found the crux of our disagreement. If I'm understanding you correctly, you think there is such a thing as an "objectively accurate summary" of a document. Now this is a subtle issue and I don't <em>entirely</em> disagree. I think that a document can be compressed to a point without making any controversial decisions about what to leave out... But I think an abstract is, by design, too short to be considered an "objective" compression of the paper. My understanding is that an abstract ––usually a single paragraph––is far too short for its author (whether it's a person or an algorithm) avoid <em>controversial</em> decisions about what to include. It simply is not possible to make an "objective" abstract. I don't think that experts could ever come to a consensus about the particular choices made for writing any given abstract. They would likely come to agree that while some of the decisions are normative, many of the decisions are individual / discretionary.</p>
<p>My conclusion, then, is that––since academic discourse is centered around the intellectual property of its contributors (not in the monetary sense, but in the credit sense)––the rightful owner of the abstract is the author of the paper. Hence, the author should have the final say as to what goes into his or her abstract.</p>
<p>Having said this,  I think that one could check how <em>accurate</em> an abstract is––in a very literalistic sense. That is to say, one could check for lies of commission, but not lies of omission.  One could also measure how comprehensive an abstract is. One could ask "compared to the smallest possible objective summary, how many claims made it into this abstract?" However, the latter metric wouldn't necessarily tell us much about how "good" the abstract is. Depending on the size of the paper and the priorities of the author / publishers, standards of comprehensiveness would vary. If we had tools to measure those things, it would be a great tool for reviewers. I can imagine a new wave of desk rejections on the grounds of false claims in abstracts. Access to such a tool could also make writing accurate abstracts much easier. I'll bet a lot of scientists would make tweaks based on a grammarly-like abstract checking tool.

<p>In terms of writing abstracts, there's an active field of research called "abstractive summarisation". I found a summary of the state of the art ca. 2019 <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0957417418307735">here</a>. My impression is that there's a lot to be done, because we haven't yet figured out how to extract the semantics from a document effectively.</p>
<p>To that end, within category theory, there's work by <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="276692">Bob Coecke</span> and his school using CQM (categorical quantum mechanics) to encode semantics. There's a recent <a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/QNLP2019/">conference</a> to launch what they call QNLP. They've done a <a href="https://medium.com/cambridge-quantum-computing/quantum-natural-language-processing-748d6f27b31d">demonstration using a quantum computer</a> recently that Bob has talked about (Zulip thread <a href="#narrow/stream/229457-MIT-Categories.20Seminar/topic/May.207.20-.20Bob.20Coecke's.20talk">here</a>), but I think machine learning should do just fine as well: there is some evidence of deep neural networks exhibiting what appears to be quantum entanglement by <a href="https://www.cse.huji.ac.il/~yoavlevine/">Yoav Levine</a> and others (see also <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=SywXXwJAb">this paper</a> at <a href="http://OpenReview.net">OpenReview.net</a> for an example of how open peer review can take place).</p>
<p>As for informal maths, Mohan Ganesalingam has formalised a grammar of that in his <a href="https://academic.oup.com/philmat/article-abstract/25/1/143/2669621">thesis</a>, and he and Timothy Gowers did an <a href="https://gowers.wordpress.com/2013/04/14/answers-results-of-polls-and-a-brief-description-of-the-program/">experiment</a> using software written based on that grammar (paper <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10817-016-9377-1">here</a>).</p>

<p>Thank you for the resources. I've been following Coecke's work. I was only vaguely aware of the rest. Are you actively working on this project? If so, what are some of the open problems you are working on?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I think you have a rather broad definition of what the authors' "opinions" mean in this context, but perhaps I wasn't being clear about what "opinions" mean for me. By "opinions", I mean the decisions made by the authors as to what to include or exclude (the "lies" of commission and omission in your language) in the abstract. I do NOT mean the claims, arguments and factual observations made by the authors in the course of their scientific work that are recorded in the paper. As I have outlined in my proposal, such a removal of those "opinions" can be done with the full participation of the authors themselves, using an abstractive summarisation tool of the kind I have proposed, so the authors have not lost any agency at all.</p>

<p>you think there is such a thing as an "objectively accurate summary" of a document. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your subsequent arguments show that you've understood my proposal and agreed that such a thing can exist.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But I think an abstract is, by design, too short to be considered an "objective" compression of the paper. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've proposed that we modify that design, because the current design is not good enough.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My understanding is that an abstract ––usually a single paragraph––is far too short [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How long is a single paragraph? It's like asking how long a piece of string is. I've seen paragraphs that are several pages long.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hence, the author should have the final say as to what goes into his or her abstract.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree, but I think the authors should have some assistance in making those decisions, and that those decisions should not lead to the deterioration of the accuracy of the abstract.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having said this,  I think that one could check how <em>accurate</em> an abstract is––in a very literalistic sense. That is to say, one could check for lies of commission, but not lies of omission.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your subsequent proposal is capable of checking for both sorts of "lies".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One could also measure how comprehensive an abstract is. [...] If we had tools to measure those things, it would be a great tool for reviewers. I can imagine a new wave of desk rejections on the grounds of false claims in abstracts. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may be possible with an extension of the current NLP technology. What current NLP tech does is to transform text into vectors in some high-dimensional metric space, and then use the metric to estimate distances. One could conceive of extracting the arguments in a text, transforming those arguments into vectors, and then using a metric to estimate the discrepancies you've mentioned in your proposal.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, people are optimisation machines, so some exploitation is inevitable. It's still an improvement because the existence of accurate abstractive summarisation tech can help researchers become more productive. What academia is suffering from now is an information deluge, which is causing a major bout of indigestion, partly in the form of a replicability crisis. Allowing researchers to process research output more efficiently, i.e. by providing them with more informative and detailed summaries of papers, should go some way to alleviate this problem.</p>
