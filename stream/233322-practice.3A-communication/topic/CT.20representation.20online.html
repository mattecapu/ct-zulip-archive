<p>I've heard and believed for some time that category theory is <strong>overrepresented</strong> online meaning we see it pop up more often than it should compared to the actual proportions of mathematicians studying category theory. This is obviously my experience too, but I am clearly biased. I looked at the submissions for this year's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/some3">SoME</a>, and there is only one video on CT, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/some2">last year's</a> had three. So I am not convinced category theory has a bigger place than it should.</p>
<p>Have you seen evidence of CT being overrepresented or underrepresented online?<br>
Have you felt that CT is overrepresented or underrepresented online?</p>

<p>I get the impression that category theory has a level of hype/evangelism that other areas of research maths don't receive, I think partially due to the popularity online of Haskell, and the fact that the basics of category theory are easier to learn than other "advanced" topics in maths (or at least are more standalone). That said, I don't know how much this translates into actual novel category theory content - for example because the amount of category theory one encounters when learning the main concepts of Haskell is fairly surface level. </p>
<p>I would guess this is what we see reflected in the SoME submissions: it's more reflective of the proportion of people who work deeply enough with category theory that they have the depth of knowledge to make novel expository content as opposed to the proportion of people who have dipped their toes in category theory and are talking about it online.</p>

<p>One of my theories about this is that category theorists, much more than say analysts, are able to state exciting snappy results that fit in a tweet, which become obvious when you just think about them, if you understand the relevant concepts.</p>

<p>I'm curious what you think is toxic about it.  If this is true, then I'm inclined to view it as a welcome correction from the days of the late 20th century when category theory tended to be deprecated (especially in the U.S.) as useless abstraction or "just a language".  Maybe an overcorrection, but (as a category theorist) it doesn't seem intrinsically bad.  In my own opinion, there's a lot more room for categorical concepts to usefully infuse, say, an undergraduate math curriculum than has yet happened across the board.</p>

<p>CT gets a bad rap not least because of the astonishing amount of jargon that obscures things when deployed by a majority of its proponents (!= experts). </p>
<p>For example I remember joking with some folks I know about an episode (can't recall precise details, I think it was actually on Zulip) wherein some categorical construct was discussed and someone asked something to the effect of "well what is this in the case of Set" and it turned out that the answer was "it's a function". </p>
<p>There are very few or zero nontrivial examples of constructions in many cases and the culture is not geared towards producing or exploring them. Arnol'd of course would say that (paraphrasing again) one's understanding of a concept is bounded by the examples that can be exhibited, and many folks (myself included) are deeply sympathetic to that viewpoint. </p>
<p>This is all manifested online more than in personal interactions, which heightens perceptions.</p>
<p>The net result is a sense--at times justified by experience and at other times ironically buttressed by seeing what can be done with the tools in the hands of a master that also has facility in "ordinary" mathematics--that many proponents of CT don't understand very much at all and that it is a grift.</p>
<p>FWIW, I don't share this opinion but I understand it as a reasonable conclusion for folks who haven't been immersed in the subject. Still I understand much CT at all but find it extremely useful in some infrequent and narrow circumstances.</p>

<p>Part of that is just a conflict of cultures and ways of thinking.  As John famously said, category theorists are dual to ordinary people: they get more confused when you surround an abstract concept with lots of distracting specifics.  But CT does definitely tempt a certain sort of person to be overly dismissive of examples, which can certainly lead to bad mathematics and bad exposition.  I think this is part of what led to the original backlash against CT that I mentioned.</p>
<p>However, I would tend to think that more online exposition of category theory ought to help alleviate this problem rather than exacerbate it.</p>

<p>By the way, this:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>is an interesting perspective to hear.  I generally think of category theory as requiring <em>more</em> background than most other fields of higher math, because in order to really understand what it's doing and why, you tend to need to already know about multiple examples from multiple <em>other</em> subjects.</p>

<p>Steve, I'm not so sure that CT has an astonishing amount of jargon more so than other fields. What I often see in CT is a few basic concepts being used and reused in an astonishing number of ways. To me, this is where a lot of its power comes from. I think I use the Yoneda lemma just about every day of my life. </p>
<p>I hope, after the laughter died down, some of those folks might be prepared to believe that a statement like "functions are left adjoints in the bicategory of relations" might have a point to it after all, even a substantial point, as opposed to being an exercise in intellectual wankery. </p>

<p>I am. Maybe my sense of number is off but the ratio of theorems to definitions seems to me to be lower than in any other field I can think of (for the other extreme, consider areas like numerical analysis, PDE, or probability). The nLab seems to exemplify this.</p>

<p>I agree that CT probably has a lower ratio of theorems to definitions, but I would tend to say that's because it has fewer theorems rather than because it has more definitions.  And the reason it has fewer theorems, I would say, may be partly because it just has fewer results, but als partly because the most important facts tend to be so easy to prove that people don't bother calling them theorems.</p>

<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that a bunch of results in category theory are constructions, and even definitions are results. How often do you see a paper where the main contribution is a novel definition that manages to re-prove a known result?</p>
<p>Further, areas like numerical analysis, PDE etc, the results are often techniques, and one might in a parallel universe make a formal definition that outlines a technique, but that's now how those fields work.</p>
<p>Algebraic geometry surely has much more jargon than category theory, in any case. But it is a lot older, and that's a field where there are a large number of concrete examples. One could similarly make a formal definition of an example (this is true for some, eg the Hilbert scheme, or even as low-brow as projective space), but this doesn't happen.</p>

<p>The representation of category theory online was no doubt helped by the attitude of the category theory community to the internet, which had the mailing list, do doubt because of its geographic sparseness, and then TAC started in the early days - and people like John B who was chronically online before that was a phrase, and willing to talk about categories to anyone. Being a younger subject no doubt helped (another early electronic-journal-adopting community was that of combinatorics, to some extent, and that is also a relatively young field).</p>
<p>The over-representation of CT online balances out the over-representation of certain traditional fields in some of the fancy "generalist" journals that nevertheless somehow focus largely on relatively few topics. <span aria-label="upside down" class="emoji emoji-1f643" role="img" title="upside down">:upside_down:</span></p>

<p>I think any branch of math you're just learning seems to have an annoyingly large amount of jargon.  Later, once you've mastered a lot of the jargon and are digging deeper, you discover it has an annoyingly large number of theorems.  <span aria-label="upside down" class="emoji emoji-1f643" role="img" title="upside down">:upside_down:</span></p>

<p>But if you know category theory you see right away that's not what's going on here: the amazing thing is that we're defining a group without using the fact that Set has finite products, just its monoidal structure and pullbacks.   This is the sort of thing you tend to think is impossible!</p>

<p>I'm curious what you think is toxic about it.  If this is true, then I'm inclined to view it as a welcome correction from the days of the late 20th century when category theory tended to be deprecated (especially in the U.S.) as useless abstraction or "just a language".  Maybe an overcorrection, but (as a category theorist) it doesn't seem intrinsically bad.  In my own opinion, there's a lot more room for categorical concepts to usefully infuse, say, an undergraduate math curriculum than has yet happened across the board.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is going to be a very long reply, because your comment is wrong on a multitude of levels in my opinion, and I will try to address at least some of them.</p>
<p>The following is a quote from Rota 1993 on the proceedings of the Category Theory conference held in 1991:</p>
<p>It is good to know that category theory is alive and well after all these years. We were turned off to category theory by the excesses of the sixties, when a small but loud crowd pretended to reduce all of mathematics to the language of categories. Now at least they have toned down their claims, and category theory has taken its modest place in the mathematical spectrum side by side with lattice theory, more pretentious perhaps than the latter, but with a good pedigree. [...]</p>
<p>What stems from the quote is that the CT community always had a kind of evangelic attitude, and like many minorities, it had to work in order to assess/conquer its relevance and importance. For the lack of counterfactuals,  it is hard to claim that this behavior has brought success to the community. Maybe the community has gained some success, <em>despite</em> this behavior?! It's hard to say. It is a fact though that between 1945 and the late 2000s the community has grown in size and prestige. Some pieces of evidence of this are JPAA, which has found its place among the most relevant specialist journals in algebra, Street joining the EB of Advances, and some prestigious publications, say by Moerdijk, in journals of the level of Compositio. These three examples, which are far from being cherry-picked, all happened before what I would call "the blog post era", and ages before the "Twitter era".</p>
<p>Since 2010, if anything, the community has lost in prestige and academic relevance, despite (I totally admit it) having reached a much broader audience in popularization and pop culture. The number of prestigious journals we have access to has drastically declined and is now totally restricted to Advances, JPAA is losing quite some prestige and is less and less controlled by CT-sts, it would be unimaginable nowadays to see a CT paper appear on Compositio. Yes, the community has had the HoTT sprint for a while, but that has lost quite some of its initial momentum too and -- I think --, overall, if we compare generation by generation, yours (Mike) is less prestigious than its parents, and mine is even less prestigious than yours.</p>
<p>Now, on a more "pop-culture" side of the story, I agree we have gained a lot in visibility, and this is mostly due to the twitting/blogging thing I touched on previously. Has this truly benefitted our community?! That's unclear. And let me stress, this is the behavior I was calling toxic, not the one of the elder generation. In order to discuss it, let me describe it better.</p>
<p>John, who is the person I was responding to, wrote "category theorists, much more than say analysts, are able to state exciting snappy results that fit in a tweet". This is indeed what happens all the time, a somewhat young and often not very expert PhD student that was nourished in mottos and nlab stories writes on Twitter that whatever all mathematicians are doing is, in fact, all trivial and reduces to the bright and somewhat magical fact that a monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors. The result? A number of narcissist crackpots enter this very zulip for a couple of weeks and then leave it, a number of young PhD students in other areas think that the PhD student is just an annoying prick (deservedly), and the PhD student grows with a strange complex of superiority which is incredibly hard to heal later in their studies. How is this <em>not</em> supposed to be toxic, I wonder. Now, I have mentioned PhD students here, but I honestly believe that a number of more senior searchers are not only themselves part of what I described, but also responsible for the behavior of their PhD students, who just repeated their attitude. </p>
<p>All in all, am I saying that we should not try to make category theory broader in scope and more impactful on the math community? Of course not! We should! And I think my actions show that I am very much invested in that. Twitting "ah-ah, you are all my pawns, because universal algebra is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors and I rule them all. Am I not the smartest?", instead, may not be the best way to actively do healthy popularization, let alone dissemination of category theory.</p>

<p>Oh, nice!  That may be the first time I've heard it, but it resonates. When you think of the Beck-Chevalley condition derived from a pullback, it looks like it's going to be connected to Frobenius equations (as in Frobenius algebras).</p>

<p>What are "nlab stories"?  I've heard of the nLab, but they sound really awful, the way you say it. (Seriously, what examples do you have in mind?) </p>
<p>The nLab is both a great resource, and a rather skewed resource, being in very large part the creation of a single very energetic individual with a decidedly individual point of view and agenda (using "agenda" not in a negative sense).  A lot of it is, to me, quite hard to read, and not exactly "nourishing" unless I invest a major effort. Perhaps it's quoted a lot, but is it representative of online category theory?  I'd think the Cafe is more indicative of what online interactions between category theorists look like.  (You'll find theorems stated there, too.) </p>
<p>I'm hardly on Twitter ever, so can't comment on the smart-ass PhD student or his adviser who sound like walking caricatures.  My own form of wasting time is mostly on YouTube.  There's some pretty good online representation there in the form of talks.  I tend to avoid watching the intro stuff.</p>

<p>Are there online communities like this one focused on other areas of math? If not - or even if there are a few others, but not many - I think that makes category theory pretty special in terms of how it is represented online. If there are other similar communities, I would be very interested to learn about them!</p>
<p>In terms of what I've been able to find online so far, this community is exceptional for (1) the presence of many subject-matter experts, (2) having a high level of activity, (3) having good moderation, and (4) being welcoming to questions from beginners. I also feel that this community is really good at facilitating extended open-ended conversations, something that is difficult to do on many other websites, including stackexchange and reddit.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277318">@Ivan Di Liberti</span>, I'm not sure in what way your comment is a disagreement with mine.  My understanding is that the "small but loud crowd" you mention is the major reason <em>why</em> category theory tended to be viewed badly in the 20th century, as I mentioned.  And the gradual generational displacement of those folks, and of the folks who were originally turned off by them, is I think a major factor in the growth of CT through the late 20th century and early 21st that you mention.  I don't know if I agree that CT has declined in prestige over the past decade -- I'm doubtful of the usefulness of "number of category theorists on the board of hoity-toity journals" as a metric of that -- but even if that's just your definition of "prestige", I think the pop-culture visibility is more relevant to what I was talking about and responding to.</p>

<p>I have never felt this in disciplines wherein one actually computes things.

If I want to enumerate all the Dyck paths of a certain size then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number#Proof_of_the_formula">there are quite a few ways to do it</a>, and perhaps some machinery to learn (say a generating function), but not a lot of concepts without associated machinery, results, or examples.</p>

<p>I'm curious what you think is toxic about it.  If this is true, then I'm inclined to view it as a welcome correction from the days of the late 20th century when category theory tended to be deprecated (especially in the U.S.) as useless abstraction or "just a language".  Maybe an overcorrection, but (as a category theorist) it doesn't seem intrinsically bad.  In my own opinion, there's a lot more room for categorical concepts to usefully infuse, say, an undergraduate math curriculum than has yet happened across the board.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is going to be a very long reply, because your comment is wrong on a multitude of levels in my opinion, and I will try to address at least some of them.</p>
<p>The following is a quote from Rota 1993 on the proceedings of the Category Theory conference held in 1991:</p>
<p>It is good to know that category theory is alive and well after all these years. We were turned off to category theory by the excesses of the sixties, when a small but loud crowd pretended to reduce all of mathematics to the language of categories. Now at least they have toned down their claims, and category theory has taken its modest place in the mathematical spectrum side by side with lattice theory, more pretentious perhaps than the latter, but with a good pedigree. [...]</p>
<p>What stems from the quote is that the CT community always had a kind of evangelic attitude, and like many minorities, it had to work in order to assess/conquer its relevance and importance. For the lack of counterfactuals,  it is hard to claim that this behavior has brought success to the community. Maybe the community has gained some success, <em>despite</em> this behavior?! It's hard to say. It is a fact though that between 1945 and the late 2000s the community has grown in size and prestige. Some pieces of evidence of this are JPAA, which has found its place among the most relevant specialist journals in algebra, Street joining the EB of Advances, and some prestigious publications, say by Moerdijk, in journals of the level of Compositio. These three examples, which are far from being cherry-picked, all happened before what I would call "the blog post era", and ages before the "Twitter era".</p>
<p>Since 2010, if anything, the community has lost in prestige and academic relevance, despite (I totally admit it) having reached a much broader audience in popularization and pop culture. The number of prestigious journals we have access to has drastically declined and is now totally restricted to Advances, JPAA is losing quite some prestige and is less and less controlled by CT-sts, it would be unimaginable nowadays to see a CT paper appear on Compositio. Yes, the community has had the HoTT sprint for a while, but that has lost quite some of its initial momentum too and -- I think --, overall, if we compare generation by generation, yours (Mike) is less prestigious than its parents, and mine is even less prestigious than yours.</p>
<p>Now, on a more "pop-culture" side of the story, I agree we have gained a lot in visibility, and this is mostly due to the twitting/blogging thing I touched on previously. Has this truly benefitted our community?! That's unclear. And let me stress, this is the behavior I was calling toxic, not the one of the elder generation. In order to discuss it, let me describe it better.</p>
<p>John, who is the person I was responding to, wrote "category theorists, much more than say analysts, are able to state exciting snappy results that fit in a tweet". This is indeed what happens all the time, a somewhat young and often not very expert PhD student that was nourished in mottos and nlab stories writes on Twitter that whatever all mathematicians are doing is, in fact, all trivial and reduces to the bright and somewhat magical fact that a monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors. The result? A number of narcissist crackpots enter this very zulip for a couple of weeks and then leave it, a number of young PhD students in other areas think that the PhD student is just an annoying prick (deservedly), and the PhD student grows with a strange complex of superiority which is incredibly hard to heal later in their studies. How is this <em>not</em> supposed to be toxic, I wonder. Now, I have mentioned PhD students here, but I honestly believe that a number of more senior searchers are not only themselves part of what I described, but also responsible for the behavior of their PhD students, who just repeated their attitude. </p>
<p>All in all, am I saying that we should not try to make category theory broader in scope and more impactful on the category theory community? Of course not! We should! And I think my actions show that I am very much invested in that. Twitting "ah-ah, you are all my pawns, because universal algebra is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors and I rule them all. Am I not the smartest?", instead, may not be the best way to actively do healthy popularization, let alone dissemination of category theory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You talk of (1) the place of category theory in the mathematical community and (2) the popularity of category theory on the net but don't say anything about (3) the place of category theory in computer science. The reason why I've been going into category theory is because together with type theory it provides a fundational language that can speak at the same time of computer science and mathematics. By the way, I don't have any problem with saying that category theory is a language because language is important. I see the mathematical community often hesitant to adopt this language, because they are used to the set-theory + classical logic foundation and don't want to change their habits and being told that they are not working in the right way. I see the computer science community much more open to adopt this language, because contrary to the former community, they don't already have a strong foundational language they are used to and they have only to gain into adopting this language. Some people in engineering or other applied sciences too have an open mindset towards category theory because they don't already have another foundational language they are used to and thus have mostly to gain with adopting this one.</p>
<p>There is probably some link between the popularity of CT on the net and its use and perhaps importance in computer science. Functional progamming language like Haskell are strongly inspired by lambda calculus (ie. cartesian closed categories), or other things like functors, or monads. There are big journals and conference in computer science,  including the most prestigious ones, where a lot of work on category theory is published. I don't think the popularity of CT on the net is only a consequence of the attitude of some mathematicians on Twitter. The relation between category theory and computer science probably also plays a role. And this relation has nothing to do with the behavior of some people but is just a fact in science, human knowledge or whatever you call something that includes these two fields at the same time.</p>

<p>I really dislike getting involved in these sorts of conversations, but I really was rather taken aback by what seems to be a common thread of logic here, namely that one can dispute the reputation of one's field. If people outside of CT say "oh CT people seem very X", then people <em>inside</em> of CT just <em>cannot dispute this</em> — not because X is right or wrong (this makes no difference!) but just because by very definition members of a community cannot say how they <em>do</em> appear to outsiders.

<p>I think we're just talking about different things.  Sure, if that's what you mean by "prestige," then yes.  Maybe I should have figured that was what you meant by prestige.  But I didn't think that was what we were talking about.  The original subject of this thread was about the representation of category theory in online conversations, and that's what I was still talking about and what I assumed you were also talking about.  That doesn't have much to do with the presence of category theorists on editorial boards.</p>

<p>This is true.

<p>(Maybe it can be considered an instance of the microcosm principle, since the pullback is a sort of "completed parallelogram" too.)</p>

<p>one way CT is different than most areas of math is that because of "commercial category theory", CT concepts participate in marketing campaigns.  For example, we have marketing copy (some of which is on my web site) likening kan extensions to the silmarils from lord of the rings.  but hopefully that's just harmless fun and doesn't interfere in using online tools to get math done.  I suppose this is also seen a bit in type theory where you still see "lambda" used in marketing (e.g. "lambda conf" for programmers, etc)</p>

<p>There's a number of things I don't understand about this conversation: for starters, why the opening message asks about "overrepresentation of category theory" and the subsequent replies focus instead on the usual pitch "category theory is difficult to learn", "category theorists are asshole gung-hos", "category theory is very abstract as opposed to numerical analysis"?</p>
<p>I interpret the question as follows: there are many resources to learn category theory online, there are many communities for category theorists to discuss, and there are many different communities using category theory in very different ways. But the offline community is scattered and (over the number of all mathematicians) small. Why?</p>

<p>In the above form, I heard the same comment from an algebraic geometer, my office mate at 3rd and 4th year of PhD.</p>
<p>As far as I remember from the conversation I had, the reason for my colleague's surprise was that category theorists seem to form a quite compact community (little he knew about the quibbles that we can raise!), and one who is quite vocal about how category theory is cool, you should learn it, and join us.</p>
<p>Plus, a conference like the CT, where almost the entire community gathers together to do category theory, looked unthinkable to my colleague (different algebraic geometers have different sub-channels).</p>

<p>I think my colleague saw a pattern that until that day I was unaware of. And I believe it's true that there is an inverse correlation with how few we are (and how little political influence we have in the grand scheme of things) compared with other larger communities. We feel the urge to stick together because our peers are quite far, geographically. Collaboration becomes more difficult, staying updated on what other people are working on is more difficult (and thus, learning new things).</p>
<p>An example of a lively, goal-oriented, well-trained group of category theorists is the Macquarie school. I can think of very few others -more precisely: I can't think of any equally well-established, similar reality in my surroundings (or in the surroundings of the place where I lived, or where I could move: let me also remark the obvious fact that if you live in a different continent than Oceania, it's rarely an easy step to relocate in Australia; some people can't, some people don't want to.</p>

<p>I agree with your assessment of the conversation and your understanding of my question. Although there is one thing missing from your message: I still don't know if my feeling (our collective feeling it seems) is justified. Is there data to support that the field of CT is different in those ways than other fields? Do all fields of mathematics have peculiarities (if all do, then I guess they are not peculiar) in how they are practiced online and offline that we do not observe?</p>

<p>So, staying in touch with the people that do the math we like, despite the distance, is a matter of survival that people working in PDE or numerical analysis do not know as much as we do. </p>
<p>(let me address <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="284005">@Ralph Sarkis</span> question above -and at the same time, sorry for not getting all my replies in a single message: my train of thoughts works that way, I don't know if your feeling is justified: I would say yes, but my data points are anecdotal).</p>
<p>My experience is also anecdotal, but I can try to outline it shortly. When I decided that I wanted to study category theory, thirteen years ago, the situation was quite different than it is today. It was nearly impossible to find someone with which you could study category theory as an unknown student from another university. Sure, the basics can be learned no matter what -be it with logic, algebra or else- but from MSc on things got harder and harder, to the point that finding an advisor to do a thesis "in category theory" was impossible -and mine was a compromise between what I could do given where I was, and what I wanted to do.<br>
MSc in Padova had a course in representation theory, and a course in rings and modules. I was mocked by the teacher because I phrased a question I had in the language of monoidal categories. "Mocked" is not an exaggeration: I was literally exposed to the class as the weird guy (so, pretty low in the iceberg meme...)</p>
<p>PhD then was pure hell, and I reserve to the majority of the people I endured during those years nothing but endless hatred and disdain. It is not an exaggeration to say that I earned a PhD degree <em>despite</em> them.</p>
<p>At each step of this headed-down stairway it became more and more important to rely on the online community of category theorists to (maintain my mental health and) keep in touch with people doing math I cared about. I didn't succeed in the first, so I became a sociopath with an extremely high tendency to rip the jugular vein of whoever puts other people in the same situation I was in, but in order to do the second, the nLab, the n-café and other resources outside of handbooks and lecture notes and papers were nothing less than <em>essential</em> to survive as a mathematician, despite my sheer isolation.</p>
<p>I consider my experience an exception, but I wasn't the only victim of isolation; I find miracolous that I remained in the system despite isolation, that I didn't break under that pressure. But this is another story, for another time.<br>
I feel this aspect of the situation is changing, more and more as category theory permeates more and more the outside world, and gets "tainted" with other things. There is a price to pay for this, but this is another story for a different day.</p>
<p>Your perception of the situation is, then, true in my opinion; we're few people. We struggle with recognition (CT is young, and got many people stoned -or it was something they cut it with? in its infancy; then everyone was a bit nauseated). We find refuge where we can when we are ostracized. Internet is good because it shortens the distance between people.</p>

<p>This became starkly evident to me when I left academia. The more I got involved with industry the more my twitter timeline began to shift towards industry oriented things.

<p>I avoided mentioning twitter and other social networks precisely because of this: my timeline is essentially all category theory. Yours, isn't. There is no objective sense of "overrepresentation" as a consequence. I can only think of overrepresentation as "given how loud and scary category theorists are online, I would expect them to be way more present in the landscape of modern mathematics"</p>
<p>And here's where I am surprised Mike can be a bit shortsighted: "how many category theorists are in the hoity toity journals" is a metric I wouldn't want to adopt, but that I consider faithful to describe how category theory is perceived by non-category theorists. Same with "how many category theorists are invited speakers at the ICM?" and "how many category theorists receive prestigious mathematical prizes?", and "how many category theorists won a Fields medal?" In all these cases, the answer gets more and more depressing as years pass. And people talk shit about category theory <em>because they measure what branch of math is cool, influential or deep using exactly these parameters</em>.</p>

<p>I could talk about this (which in my opinion is the heart of the matter) for hours, but I won't. In short: people who think that "cool math is ICM math / Fields medal stuff only" are idiots whose head is filled with tar. The responsibility to change the situation is not of a twitter star. It's <em>ours</em>, and it's the responsibility to write good books, teach well (and sneak category theory inot everything we teach), but most of all <em>the responsibility to stay in the system, get tenured and hire our colleagues</em>.</p>

<p>Fields and people who solve problems that others--and especially others in different fields-- regard as meaningful get more respect than those that don't. This is true across the board. The respect may come from different places (pay, prestige, tenure, etc.) but if you want respect from others, do things they respect. Nothing is respected by onlookers more than solving problems (theory-building is far behind). If self-respect suffices for you, then great.</p>

<p>I think this current phase of the conversation is acting like there's a sharp divide between category theorists and other mathematicians, and some sort of extreme lack of appreciation of category theory on the part of outsiders.  Maybe I'm weird but I just don't see that.   There are plenty of big-shot mathematicians - Fields medalists, etc. - who use category theory.   Voevodsky's difficulty with n-categories let him to develop homotopy type theory, and now that's been revealed to have deep connections to higher topos theory.   Alain Connes is advocating the use of topos theory in his work on the Riemann Hypothesis.   Peter Scholze's work on condensed mathematics is of great interest to category theorists, and he's even commented on the n-Category Cafe about this stuff.    There are also other rock stars who aren't Fields Medalists, notably Jacob Lurie at MIT, who revolutionized work on higher categories and higher topoi.    All this stuff is of interest to a lot of mathematicians.</p>

<p>I am increasingly noting some kind of renewed excitement about category theory, mostly from outside of mathematics, and also in particular in AI.  Academic culture is notoriously conservative so it will take a while before mainstream mathematics gets back on board, but the world is moving on, either with or without their approval.  Don't want to do a spoiler, but got some really big news soon to be announced. Say no more for now...</p>

<p>For me, this is a resource allocation problem. A state (or university, or group, or non profit, or company) has some resources to allocate to various things. Ideally, you would like people providing the resources to express some kind of preference, and then you would like to allocate said resources to maximize collective welfare.</p>
<p>We can make an argument about investing resources into a 'riskier' enterprise - that is, something that may deliver very big but only on a very long timescale. This is what investing money on the majority of mathematical research is about. And still mathematics, like everything else, does not exist in a vacuum.</p>
<p>So going from 'justifying why something is needed' to 'pretending funding and recognition because I say so' is really something I cannot justify.</p>

<p>I agree with you that not everything should be decided by direct vote, indeed I do not believe direct democracy is inherently a good idea. You're preaching to the choir here. But 'justifying my existence to whoever has to decide resource allocation (it can be the university, a DAO, a bureaucrat behind a desk, does not matter)' is still needed. If you want to do mathematics (or whatever, it doesn't matter) without being bothered by justifying anything to society, then create an autarchical commune somewhere and do not rely on society at all.</p>

<p>Yeah, I think this whole thread is just ragebait.  Of course people have to justify their work to be funded.  Whether or not people are funded too much or too little is stupid to argue about.  No one is going to give up their funding to give it to other disciplines, and everyone will continue advocating that they get more funding.</p>

<p>Getting even further from the original topic: </p>
<p>For some reason governments have decided that people need to know some basic math but don't need to know anything about making art or music.   So funding for art and music education has been slashed.   This idea that the arts and music don't deserve to be part of education is a fairly recent cultural decision; I suspect over the course of history few cultures have felt this way.    Maybe art and music are so necessary in our lives that we don't need help to learn about them, but it's still strange how sometime around the 1980s these were decreed unimportant in the US.</p>

<p>In any case, I'd just like to point out how back in the days of mecenatism market forces were even more important than today. It is my view that artists (and mathematicians) have pretty much never been free to do whatever they wanted. If anything, the situation is now better than it was before, when these people were at the whims of whoever protected and paid for them.</p>
<p>Indeed, by looking at the lives of great artists like Michelangelo, Leonardo etc, one realizes quickly how they  were <strong>very</strong> aware of the context in which they lived (what to do and not to do, who to not piss off, which rules would be cool to break and which ones weren't).  Here's an excerpt from Michelangelo's biography by Condivi (<a href="https://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/artdok/714/1/Davis_Fontes34.pdf">https://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/artdok/714/1/Davis_Fontes34.pdf</a> pg 16 ):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] avvenne che un giorno fu dal Granacci menato al giardin de Medici à san Marco, il qual [...] havea di varie statue antiche et de figure ornato. [...] Tra le altre considerando un giorno la Testa d’un Fauno in vista già vecchio, [...] et piacendogli oltre à modo, si propose di ritrarla in marmo. [...] con tanta attentione et studio si pose a ritrarre il Fauno, che in pochi giorni lo condusse a’ perfettione, di sua fantasia suplendo tutto quello, che nel antico mancava, cioè la bocca aperta [...] con tutti i denti. In questo mezzo venendo il Magnifico per vedere à che termine fusse l’opera sua [...]  considerata primieramente l’eccellenza del opera, et havuto riguardo al età di lui, molto si maravigliò: et avenga che lodasse lopera, non dimeno mottegiando con lui, [...] oh tu hai fatto questo Fauno vecchio, et lasciatigli tutti identi. Non sai tu che à vecchi di tal età sempre ne mancha qualchuno? [...] Michelagnolo [...] restato solo, cavò un dente al suo vecchio di quei di sopra, trapanando la gingiva, come se ne fusse uscito colla radice, aspettando l’altro giorno il Magnifico, con gran desiderio. Il quale venuto, et vista la bontà et simplicità del fanciullo, molto se ne rise, ma poi stimata seco la prefettione* della cosa, et l’età di lui, come padre di tutte le virtù, si deliberò d’aiutare et favorire tanto ingegno [...]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Roughly summarized: Young Michelangelo is making a marble copy of an old faun. He sculpted the mouth with all the teeth in it. Lorenzo de Medici is impressed but remarks that old people usually lack some teeth. As soon as he walks away Michelangelo takes some teeth out of the statue, further impressing Lorenzo, which decides to give him patronage.</p>

<p>Call me a reactionary if you want to, but yes, people should spend all their time learning how to be useful and how to contribute to the social environment they're in. This is how art, literature and science have been carried out since antiquity, and the idea of people being free to do whatever they like without having to answer in any way is a rather recent (and in my opinion worse) development, which probably started with romanticism and reached its peak with the hippy movement and rock and roll idols.</p>

<p>I think that if the government were really smart, it would realize that even to be truly useful cogs in the machine, people's brains should be exposed to a lot of music and art when young.  But the government is definitely not very smart: even though it claims to value science, technology, engineering and mathematics, it is not very good at getting kids to be good in these subjects.</p>

<p>Yes, I suspect that this is a result of the libertarian turn that came with Reagan, which is terrible. Still, there is difference between 'receiving an education in something' and 'working in that field'.</p>

<p>I'm a strong believer that instruction, healthcare and other things are fundamental rights and should be guaranteed no matter what. What irks me is that since 1968 the overall political discourse seems to be centered around the concept of 'right' (fighting for rights, restricting rights), whereas the concept of 'duty', which is its dual, has been neglected completely. Even the very word 'duty' today has some militaristic vibe and is considered to be evocative of urfascistic thought. Which to be honest is bewildering to me.</p>

<p>The concepts of right and duty are both quite slippery.   People make up 'rights' when they think we should have them, but then they try to enforce these rights by sort of pretending they're like laws of nature... but laws which, unlike actual laws of nature, need to be enforced.   I haven't thought as much about how people make up 'duties', in part because - yes - the whole concept of 'duty' has been deprecated by many people.   (I guess we at least have a duty to let people have their rights, though.  <span aria-label="upside down" class="emoji emoji-1f643" role="img" title="upside down">:upside_down:</span> )</p>

<p>Nah, it's a matter of risk management. Invest less in high-risk activities, more in low-risk activities.

<p>In the end to figure out how much you have to allocate to mathematicians, you should ask engineers, mathematicians , physicists, and other people proximal to mathematics 'how important funding maths is'.

<p>I think Lawvere would say one of the main reasons CT is useful because it simplifies and clarifies so much, making it easier to pass on our knowledge and insights to generations to come. I agree with him. The concept of universal property which permeates traditional category theory, simple though it is, can be applied to cover huge swaths of mathematics, and I don't think we're close to the end of that exploration. </p>
<p>Toward the end of education, it helps that CT is beautiful. I think more and more young people are discovering that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If CT folks vociferously advocate for Hardyism (and I claim that on balance, they very much do) then they should not be surprised when folks in PDE or probability who can at least pay lip service to utility use that advocacy as a cudgel to grab a bigger piece of the pie.</p>

<p>I never said I am surprised.</p>

<p>I just discovered that you can ignore tags on mathoverflow. I conjecture that, because CT has a bad reputation (and because people sometimes act out of spite), the tag ct.category-theory will be the most ignored (out of all "big" tags, I don't know if there is a formal hierarchy of tags on MO). Is it possible to check this?</p>

<p>Hmm, I'll see/ask if there's a way...</p>
