<p>I agree, but in cases such as LiCS I think it would be a good compromise to start your presentation talk by saying that you don't agree with their proceedings policy and that you suggest them to evaluate alternatives. If everyone would do this, LiCS would probably switch to open access proceedings within a year.</p>

<p>So a good policy, similar to what Jules suggests, is that if you submit at conferences that have closed-access proceedings, then you use part your presentation time to "denounce" this.</p>

<p>I'm afraid that "within a year" might be too optimistic. The Cost of Knowledge petition was 8 years ago, and there are still a lot of papers appearing in Elsevier journals (at least in my field, I'm thinking of TCS, I&amp;C, APAL…)</p>

<p>This is related to my prior arguments about the feedback loop in academic publishing, particular in CS vs mathematics (actually, CS vs. the rest of the disciplines, but I digress).</p>
<p>The root of the problem, as I see it, is that an academic's career depends on <em>frozen</em> publications and not living bodies of work. It makes lives easier for the bean counters, but the act of fossilising papers in journals, so that you can have a record of work and priority, also has a tendency to break the feedback and dissemination system that advances knowledge within a field.</p>

<p>There are ways to game this system, even if it is done innocently. I think it's been observed that some papers are published twice in CS: once in a conference proceedings, and once in a "proper" journal (sometimes with heavy revisions and/or additions), and usually with really similar titles. There is justification to do this, namely the authors want to provide a more complete and/or updated paper, but this is frowned upon in maths and other disciplines. I see this as a solution to work around the rigid nature of the publication system.</p>

<p>There are reasons I can think of for wanting a publication system that works this way:</p>
<ul>
<li>It can help to resolve priority fights.</li>
<li>It provides a sense that there is a permanent frozen record of your work, similar to how literary writers publish books.</li>
<li>It provides a means of curating work, which was (and still is) the only way of determining the "quality" of a piece of work.</li>
<li>The scarcity of page space also provides further impetus to curate work.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, digital repository systems with timestamps (e.g. arXiv) mostly settle the issue of priority, and makes obsolete the problem of scarce page space. If you add a version control system and a feedback system to that (e.g. Github), you can have a permanent record of the <em>evolution</em> of your work, without the need for an arbitrary cut-off date imposed by the journal system. The Github system also provides a means of ascertaining the impact of your work (stars, forks, etc.), and so does Google Scholar with its citation count. This seems to take care of the "nobody is using my work and I didn't know that" problem.</p>

<p>In at least some branches of CS, the situation is somewhat different. Conference proceedings are sufficiently refereed and selective that people mainly count conference papers. This is now reflected in there being special editions of journals that serve as conference proceedings. Standalone journal publication is a "luxury" usually undertaken by established researchers who want to collect and codify a research program for posterity in a longer, more synthetic fashion.</p>
<p>In general I think that most disciplines have moved towards a preprint culture for active research (perhaps with conference and workshop presentations serving some of that role), and then more rigorously vetted things for posterity / evaluation by committees. </p>
<p>An important issue is that math is very different in a certain regard. Refereeing a math paper is a much more serious and involved task, I imagine, since it carries a stronger stamp of "here is some delicately engineered thing that we believe is True and you can Rely On".</p>

<p><span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="276650">Gershom</span>: I'm looking beyond that. I'm really not interested in this "CS v Maths" business.</p>
<p>So what I'm saying is that we have all the means now to build a publication system that provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>A permanent record of the evolution of your body of work for establishing priority.</li>
<li>A means to receive continuous peer review and feedback on your body of work.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think this would be a step forward from what we have right now, in CS, mathematics or any discipline.</p>

<p>The model you're suggesting already seems to be the "overly journals" model people are using/developing on arXiv. I think its a good idea, and I don't know what is really missing from it except I suppose time to develop and "sink in". It also doesn't seem to have room for conferences and workshops in the bits you're discussing, and I think those are nice and useful as well, of course.</p>

<p>The model you're suggesting already seems to be the "overly journals" model people are using/developing on arXiv. I think its a good idea, and I don't know what is really missing from it except I suppose time to develop and "sink in". It also doesn't seem to have room for conferences and workshops in the bits you're discussing, and I think those are nice and useful as well, of course.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, it's not just the overlay journals, and it does provide for conferences and workshops. <a href="https://openreview.net/" title="https://openreview.net/">OpenReview.net</a> is an excellent instance of an active open review system that enables conferences and workshops to create what are essentially overlay journals. I can imagine it being part of my model.</p>
<p>I don't like how journals work now, because they have a cut-off date: all feedback and peer review stops after the publication is accepted. This is like stopping patches for software once you've decided it's Version 1.0.0. As I've pointed out with the Voevodsky example, this breaks the feedback loop.</p>

<p>Even for already published papers, it would be great to have some sort of centralized system for "bug reports"; currently, if you want to know whether a paper from the 1980s is correct, you have to ask knowledgeable people about issues that might be known in the "folklore" (or attempt to redo all proofs yourself).</p>

<p>I mean, maybe it's just me, but even if I am ok in giving the proofs as an appendix, I am not ok in giving <em>definitions</em> as an appendix. So if what I am writing cannot be squeezed in 12 pages even when severely butchered and without proofs, I just don't bother</p>

<p>I guess one of the main reasons why conferences are so important is because if you submit to a conference it's easy to claim funding, esp. for PhD students. So you actually submit to see your peeps.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276424">@Rongmin Lu</span> I am not claiming my small boycott will change anything on its own. I have done other things: getting elected to the scientific board of my previous university and passing an open access policy there, building a platform to help researchers upload preprints to open archives, adding links to free to read versions of articles in Wikipedia articles (in a semi-automated way - we made tens of thousands of edits with that tool so far), crashing a presentation of an Elsevier representative in a university… None of these have achieved much in the grand scheme of things! The truth is that I don't actually care about the issue anymore, I am very happy not to stay in academia if it is not viable to only publish in OA. So my boycott is more of a matter of principle than a real aim to change anything.</p>

<p>The problem with proceedings papers as a publishing form is not only the page limits but also the deadlines. You are forced to publish in yearly 15-page installments, instead of releasing your work when it is ready and has been ironed out, and instead of letting the material dictate the form and length of the exposition.</p>

<p>Maybe in some universities a hiring and promotion committee in one department would have the unilateral right to change how they did things... but it sure ain't true at the University of California, and probably not at most other big universities: there are rules governing these things, and all decisions get reviewed by other committees which must follow rules of their own! </p>

And if <em>they</em> tried to revolt... well, you see what I mean.</p>

<p>Most of the decisions are driven by budget concerns, and quite a bit of that is due to the growing administrative apparatus that is taking up more and more of an institution's budget. I reckon librarians are confronted both with budget constraints and the demands of academics, and as the budget becomes more and more curtailed, the cheaper alternatives would become more appealing.</p>

This series is suitable for those ACM SIG-sponsored conferences that adapt their review processes to be comparable to those of journals.

<p>Related, but getting back to the open access topic: it seems that there are a lot more OA conferences (thanks to LIPIcs) than journals. So if you're sick of conferences but don't want to sign away your copyright to Elsevier / Springer / ACM / CUP, you're left with few options (for computational logic you've got LMCS, in some cases TAC, and… ?)</p>

<p>The point of having journals and other selective periodicals is to confer visible legitimacy/status/prestige through curation, and if that legitimacy isn't visible outside of a certain community, then they have failed. PACM is providing a curation service that explicitly addresses a problem peculiar to the CS community, but the problem is only peculiar in form, not in substance.</p>

<p>What I mean is that today the biggest part of the tech business is done with data, and we do not have many "open data avocates" around. Like, for many people the data issue is not really a thing. This has paradoxical applications. For instance, you can have companies like Google that open part of their sourcecode, which is tho absolutely useless for everyone else</p>

<p>So there's this famous effect in machine learning where a simpler algorithm can outperform a very complicated one when the dataset is huge. This is because the simpler algo is more flexible, and as such more difficult to train, but better suited at fitting the data when the dataset is big.</p>

<p>Open source allows for peer review, which removes one particular ethical problem, i.e. whether the code is properly scrutinised. This is especially important in this particular case, when the code in question is produced in academia and then used in public policy.</p>

<p>I think, in the context of this Zulip topic, that "source" includes "data" in its scope. After all, this topic was initially about academic peer review, and in academia, there is a trend towards asking for datasets to be made open as well.</p>
