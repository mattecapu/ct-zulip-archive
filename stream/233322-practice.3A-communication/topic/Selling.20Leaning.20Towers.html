<p>I had a vague memory that there was something, but I couldn't find anything while searching. This <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/24/error/how-maths-most-famous-proof-nearly-broke" title="http://nautil.us/issue/24/error/how-maths-most-famous-proof-nearly-broke">Nautilus article</a> claimed that Wiles submitted his proof the first time round to Inventiones, but that was successfully resolved.</p>
<p>Perhaps she brought up Inventiones as a journal of relatively high quality, but not quite Annals or Crelle's, c.f. "your average Inventiones-level paper".</p>
<p>Also, gotta love alluding to things without citation, though the 140 char limit on Twitter is probably a problem.</p>

<p>Realism is often mistaken for pessimism when the situation is far from optimal. This opinion is a realistic one, given the current situation.</p>

<p>Yes, we should demand better. However, as she's said:</p>

<p>The issue here is with the moral hazard of the uneven application of standards.</p>

<p>Which we should, but this goes into a lot of systemic issues.</p>

<p>Fantechi's comments were in response to discussions about demanding that Mochizuki should rewrite his paper to be more readable (this was the minimum desideratum for one person who turned down the chance to referee the IUT papers). She was essentially saying that it was like 'the pot calling the kettle black', since there are many people who get stuff published in top journals that just write really badly and unclearly and skip explanations of things and they get away with it. I don't think it was so much about errors in papers that get published.</p>

<p>But if things are written unclearly and skip explanations then that makes them harder to check, and makes it more likely that there are errors. Which is part of the discussion over IUT as well -- if the papers were more clear, then it would simplify the debate over correctness.</p>

<p>They're different aspects of the same issue, as Gershom's pointed out.

<p>Or if we could simply "run" proofs on our computers, and Mochizuki's work keeps producing the same compiler errors, and these compiler errors were <a href="https://elm-lang.org/news/compiler-errors-for-humans" title="https://elm-lang.org/news/compiler-errors-for-humans">written for humans</a>.</p>
