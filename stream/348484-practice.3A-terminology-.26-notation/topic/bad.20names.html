<p>Well, I didn't like that certain folklore knowledge was missing, and it was summarily removed for not being backed up by literature. With my cynics hat on, I could bet that the neologism Asm would be frowned on without at least one published article to justify it. I would hope that instead the nLab could take a principled position in this case and be a catalyst for change.</p>

<p>I feel sure that I've seen Asm in existing literature, but I don't have the time to try to track it down now.</p>
<p>I wasn't following the discussion of folklore but I thought I heard someone say that that position got moderated later.  If that's still a problem I'm happy to go raise a stink -- the nLab should absolutely be a place for recording folklore.</p>

<p>Does the literature use "Ass" for the associative operad as well? The only reference listed in that article uses "Assoc", and I'm not familiar with the literature on monads / operads at all.</p>

<p>Let me try to answer this. (I'm not attacking you or anyone, just trying to answer the question.)<br>
My very personal opinion (as someone who can't stop making nerdy jokes, ask my colleagues...) is still to avoid any sexual, political or religious references when naming mathematical entities (and software, etc).</p>
<p>The reason is that <em>we don't know who the audience will be</em>. When we tell a joke to a group of friends, colleagues, etc, we more or less know what makes them laugh, what could trigger them, offend them, or what could simply not be funny. (If a friend of mine has just lost his mother, I'm not going to make a "yo momma" joke, right?) Of course not every joke lands perfectly, and some times things get awkward anyway, but we try. Now, this strategy, crucially, <em>cannot possibly work when writing math or software</em>. </p>
<p>The thing is, mathematics is so universal and cross-cultural that it's impossible to know the background, culture, and ideas of everyone who will study it, especially in the future. And references to sex, politics and religion are the most likely ones to land badly. (For an Italian-to-Italian example: think of a foreigner that comes to Italy and starts saying <em>bestemmie</em> left and right. Some will laugh, some will be offended, some might even start a fight, and there is no way for the foreigner to know in advance.)</p>
<p>The risk is that math that <em>could have perfectly reached someone</em> from a different background, instead fails, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe the name is offensive to them, or makes them uncomfortable, especially if they talk about it in public (e.g. that's why <a href="https://nforum.ncatlab.org/discussion/3268/rocq/">Rocq</a> changed name);</li>
<li>Maybe the name gets them likely to be investigated, cancelled, threatened, or misunderstood (ironically, that's what seems to be happening with <em>homology</em> in the US under Trump);</li>
<li>Or more pragmatically, the name is so distracting that, every time the concept is approached, the conversation just ends up turning into a series of jokes (or, worse, into a political discussion). Maybe engaging, but such a waste of brain power! The thing is, we are human, and for as much as we may love math, things like "Ass" or "Fascist" or "Hell" will still draw our attention away from things like "Let's see if this epsilon depends not only on delta, but also on x".<br>
(For example, literally every conversation I've heard about Rocq <em>in my entire life</em> turned into a discussion about its name, one way or another.) </li>
</ul>
<p>This is of course not just limited to sex, politics and religion. The risk is always there. But these three are by far the most risky ones - it's just much easier to avoid those three altogehter. Or at least, that's my very personal opinion. <br>
(And I assure you, even without these, I still have plenty of material for stupid jokes.)</p>

<p>I think <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275989">@Paolo Perrone</span> has the right of it here (and I can confirm from my time at Oxford that he does make a lot of good nerdy jokes :) ).</p>
<p>I'll also just add that even jokes that are not about sensitive topics often fall flat very quickly in the context of naming mathematical objects or writing papers. They have to not just be funny to a very broad audience the first time, but also not become stale or irritating after 20 rereads of a paper or 200 references to the object. I've often had the issue that a paper with a funny title was legitimately funny and clever the first time I read it, but then really became annoying when I realized I couldn't search for it as it had no relevant keywords in the title...</p>

<p>Right, because "homo" in recent years has become a synonym of "gay" so "homology" can now be interpreted as "the study of gay people". And then it's understandable why it might be controversial in the United States.</p>

<p>Speaking of German, it has this word, <em>inhaltlich</em>, which as a scientist I find wonderful. I wish English had a word which one could use in the same way. ("On-topic" or "pertaining to the content" are close translations, but they are not used in the same way, and are not nearly used as casually or frequently as in German.) So basically what I was saying above is that a name like "Ass" turns a discussion from <em>inhaltlich</em> into <em>uninhaltlich</em>. And to me, that's exactly the end of mathematics.</p>

<li>Or more pragmatically, the name is so distracting that, every time the concept is approached, the conversation just ends up turning into a series of jokes (or, worse, into a political discussion). Maybe engaging, but such a waste of brain power! The thing is, we are human, and for as much as we may love math, things like "Ass" or "Fascist" or "Hell" will still draw our attention away from things like "Let's see if this epsilon depends not only on delta, but also on x".</li>

<p>Speaking of German, it has this word, <em>inhaltlich</em>, which as a scientist I find wonderful. I wish English had a word which one could use in the same way. ("On-topic" or "pertaining to the content" are close translations, but they are not used in the same way, and are not nearly used as casually or frequently as in German.) So basically what I was saying above is that a name like "Ass" turns a discussion from <em>inhaltlich</em> into <em>uninhaltlich</em>. And to me, that's exactly the end of mathematics.</p>

<p>Would "salient" or "relevant" be good translations?</p>

<p>The parent discussion was triggered b6 sudden nLab purism for being all grown up and not having a little fun, which I find less harmful than having a nLab page whose title is an outright off-colour joke, even when the latter appears in the literature.</p>
<p>The 'final exam' attributed to "Phreilambud" in a CT Springer lecture notes volume is a good example of off jokes aging badly, even if some of them are still funny and nerdy (prove Mac Lane's theorem that all diagrams commute)</p>

<p>FWIW, the pages <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/assembly">[[assembly]]</a> and <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/associative%20operad">[[associative operad]]</a> look unobjectionable to me. </p>
<p>The page <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Ass">[[Ass]]</a> calls attention to itself quite needlessly IMO. My own inclination would be to remove it. </p>
<p>There was a point in time when the nLab had a very busy editor whom we finally asked to stop; during that time I was prompted to start the article <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/writing%20in%20the%20nLab">[[writing in the nLab]]</a>. I'm going to quote something I think is relevant: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unless you are supremely confident in your expository skills, the advice if you are a newcomer is generally to write straight mathematics ... Anything that distracts or deflects the reader’s attention or any unnecessary digression is, in mathematical writing, generally bad.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would say the article <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Ass">[[Ass]]</a> is a distraction. In contrast, the quick citation in passing of the abbreviation Ass on the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/assembly">[[assembly]]</a> page is appropriate and does not cause undue attention to itself. Nothing more needs to be said on the matter, outside of the nForum (which is where I think policy discussions generally belong).</p>

<p>There's a certain self-fulfilling prophecy in hunting down these unfortunate names, namely that then people can't help but address them... I remember someone giving an informal talk once, involving the double powerset monad... PP. People were fine until someone audibly laughed, at which point the spell dissolved, we all became aware of the ambiguity and couldn't help but laugh at the silliness of the situation.<br>
IMO it's good to try and avoid awkward terminology when possible, but we can also just be adults and, the same way you don't laugh in your doctor's face if they mention genitals, we can keep it together if someone abbreviates associativity to 'ass'...</p>

<p>I don't really get how "Ass" in the UK any less of a bad name than stuff like "evil". Yes, it doesn't have the same connotations it does in North America, but people are still going to be distracted talking about the non-mathematical common definition, whether it be donkeys or morality.</p>

<p>I also wouldn't have noticed SS here. But with regard to ASS, words from the lead-in to Sir Mix-a-Lot's Baby Got Back seem a propos: "it's like, out there". </p>
<p>There was an n-Category Cafe post, <em>Mathematical Emotion</em> by David Corfield, with a whole bunch of such discussion. <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/11/mathematical_emotion.html#c029905">One of the comment threads</a>, concerning "ass", was started by Urs, and developed into a long and emotional conversation. [Elsewhere under David's post, someone began to complain about "bra" (appearing in bra-ket, and also in "algebra", now that I think of it) and "cleavage" (as it relates to fibrations).]  I bring this up mainly because <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/11/mathematical_emotion.html#c029941">Toby</a> argued for why "Ass" should be considered okay for general use. </p>
<p>Obviously I didn't agree, but I generally advocate gentle persuasion and an appeal to reasonableness over outright censorship.</p>
