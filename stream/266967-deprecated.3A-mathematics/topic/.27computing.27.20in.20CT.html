<p>I have never felt this in disciplines wherein one actually computes things. Take enumerative combinatorics as an extreme opposite case: there are certainly a lot of  concepts and terms, but at a basic level there are not many definitions to wade through for any particular sort of problem. If I want to enumerate all the Dyck paths of a certain size then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number#Proof_of_the_formula">there are quite a few ways to do it</a>, and perhaps some machinery to learn (say a generating function), but not a lot of concepts without associated machinery, results, or examples.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You don't think CT-ists actually compute things? </p>
<p>I don't know about others, but I feel that I compute things all the time as I work in category theory. One example that came up not so long ago was to compute the set of natural transformations from one functor Vect --&gt; Set to another, where the first takes a vector space to its n-fold tensor power and the other was some other functor. "Compute" here means to characterize these things in simple concrete terms. For example, if the second functor is the same as the first here, then natural transformations are tantamount to (are in natural bijection with) elements of the group algebra of kS_n, where k is the ground field. </p>
<p>If one's idea of computing or calculating is relegated to computing numbers, then I don't know what to say. That would be a limited meaning. I would naturally use the word "compute" to describe what I was doing, and wouldn't know what else to call it. I think a lot of category theorists engage in this sort of humble but honest activity, routinely.</p>

<p>I feel that there is a notion of computing a colimit which amounts to giving an explicit and compact/tangible description of the equivalence classes in the quotient.</p>
<p>Often I find this goes as follows: Given F : D -&gt; Sets a functor, find a reasonably small/workable subcategory A : C -&gt; D and a functor T : C -&gt; Sets such that F is the left Kan extension of T along A and thus has the same colimit.</p>

<p>One minor caveat here: I would also think of "computing" data structures that are conveniently encoded with numbers. A homology group (which I can exhibit by a matrix indexed by generators that are themselves conveniently encoded with numbers) would fit this bill for any fans of categorifying things.</p>

<p>Hm. So if the question were changed to: find the number of natural transformations, that would count? </p>
<p>Since you brought up enumerative combinatorics, I'll say that a lot of time-tested ways to calculate numbers of structures -- bijective proofs -- typically involve proving two functors are isomorphic (Joyal species). I would call computing the number of structures of one type by bijecting them with another easy-to-count type of structure just that, a computation. Examples from q-mathematics pop to mind.</p>

<p>It is entirely possible that I am mistaken here. But the observations I have been able to make over the years support the conclusion I've reached. Happy to be disabused of it but anecdotes of "someone computed something once" or "here's a equals sign I can point to in a paper" have a lot of inertia to counter in my case.</p>

<p>Yes, I think that falls under the same general heading as oracle computation, which I mentioned.  As I said, I doubt there is a kind of computation of that sort that describes what we do when "computing" a homology group.  And if you are supposing an informal notion of "computation" that just means "anything a mathematician can do," then there's no reason that would be restricted to numbers at all.</p>

<p>Probably wise, we should knock it off soon. </p>
<p>Now I'm not saying I think Steve thinks this, but -- since we're sharing personal impressions -- I've long gotten the sense that people think of "soft" (conceptual) mathematics or mathematicians as something less than red-blooded or doing "real stuff".

<p>So the idea that CT-ists are some sort or arty, airy bunch who love to engage in sophisticated jargon-laden discussions, who are not down-to-earth types, like those hard analysts -- well, surely some of that may be true, but I think it's largely a caricature and isn't in tune with the multi-faceted reality of what committed category theorists really do.

<p>fwiw, I think there is a blind spot in applied category theory re: computation, that needs to be further developed, and I commend the HoTT community for doing work in this area.  in particular, I claim that in many ways, applied category theory "should be" the same thing as computer algebra; but whereas in e.g. the group theory community there is a lot discussion about algorithms and how to solve word problems and what to do with software packages like Mathematica, in applied category theory, most work is still done on paper, and I'm not sure why there's such a divergence from group theory in that regard.</p>

<p>Looking back on this, I see that you were under the impression that I a) thought CT-ists didn't actually compute and that b) your set of natural transformations gizmo didn't count as a computation. I want to clarify these, because neither was or is the case. a) I think CT-ists don't compute many things <em>in</em> CT versus <em>using</em> CT, with Kan extensions being now an (or the) obvious counterexample. b) could be called a computation versus a characterization (not sure I would feel comfortable eliding such a distinction but OK), and it can clearly be encoded numerically: take a basis as a matrix, form its tensor powers, and encode the algebraic operations. But insofar as there is computation here, there isn't much of a CT-ish computational objective--it is a group-theoretical one, and the computations are only "in" CT insofar as the problem has been translated there: this strikes me as more fairly called "using" CT than "in" CT. Now it <em>is</em> a CT-ish objective to characterize this gizmo "in" CT, and you've done that by construction. Fair enough?</p>

<p>But (again please correct me) Yoneda seems more commonly used to characterize things than to compute as part of an algorithm. Now I know we aren't gonna be able to define that because as Yanofsky showed any meaningful notion of algorithm has an undecidable equality predicate, but like Potter Stewart I know an algorithm when I see one.</p>

There are enough applications of this to automated reasoning that we were able to publish in the journal of automated reasoning itself, not in a category theory journal.  I think that is another under appreciated point - I'm not convinced applied category theory results are of interest to domain experts, unless they are published in domain-specific journals, rather than math ones.</p>

<p>Indeed except for the Kan stuff, which I didn't think of previously, I'm still not sure I've spotted another class of computations, and I suspect the generality of Kan things might even subsume vast swathes of algorithms/computations that aren't generally thought of in that idiom. </p>

<p>Fair enough. Whenever I computed something I've been able to look back and seen how in principle it could have been done on a computer, and usually in practice I actually try to prove things by writing code in a poor man's Curry-Howard mindset and writing things up in natural language afterwards. </p>
<p>Often I thought (and think) of my work as a composition of preparatory work ("characterization") with a "mechanical process" a la Turing ("computation"). I need to do the former but in principle only to understand the latter because it can be outsourced to silicon (even though paper is often faster and more useful in practice). My impression has been (and apart from the Kan extension algorithm stuff still is) that CT is more focused on characterization than <em>any other field</em> of mathematics and that this is its nature and intent. A lot of the time (maybe every time?) mathematicians say "is just" they are channeling this, but they are not computing.</p>
<p>BTW can you comment on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05338">https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05338</a>? I get that it doesn't compute everything.</p>

<p>Here's an example of what people in CT compute, from an example I saw yesterday, I think: given that some object exists by some universal property (it was an exponential in some (2-)category, in what I saw), what actually <strong>is</strong> that object? In the sense of being able to say concretely what the elements are (if this were a concrete category) or what the objects are (if this was an exponential in some 2-category of structured categories, asy), and in a way whose definition is independent of the characterisation by that universal property. Even better if you can give a concrete isomorphism to a priori known and understood object/categories whose objects are a priori known.</p>
<p>Perhaps this falls under the banner of "computing Kan extensions", but this way of looking at it unpacks the actual output of the computation (what even does it mean to "compute a Kan extension" anyway?).</p>
<p>The computation process often involves chaining together known CT theorems, other "calculated" universal objects (i.e. they have a concrete description, but have been shown to satisfy a universal property) and taking advantage of their abstract CT properties and/or some concrete fact to arrive at some concrete description of what the universal object of interest is.</p>
<p>I'm put in mind of the whole Schur functor story that <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277611">@Todd Trimble</span> and collaborator(s) have worked out. There's some abstract 2-rig stuff, but it comes down to computing the "solution" to be a specific known thing.</p>

<p>There's also another sense of of computing, which matters a lot to me.  To me it means working in a situation where I know a bunch of rules for manipulating symbols and I'm applying these rules to:</p>
<ul>
<li>prove two expressions are equal,</li>
<li>reduce an expression to some sort of desired form,  the details of which I don't know ahead of time,</li>
<li>find patterns that may lead to theorems,</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is often a lot of exploration and blundering around, not only because I make actual errors but also because I don't know which rule to apply when - and there may also be missing rules that I discover I need, and have to prove.  I have a personal feeling for when I'm "computing" something in this sense, and it's different than "proving" someting, though it may be used to prove something.</p>
<p>I did a bunch of computing - in this sense - to prove Lemma 15 on Kaehler differentials <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2023/08/grothendieckgaloisbrauer_theor_2.html">here</a>.  By the final writeup there was not much computing left, and I pushed it into Lemma 16.  But this is the distilled result of a lot of blundering about, which was at times rather frustrating since Lemma 15 has a superficially much more elegant proof <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A4hler_differential#Definition_using_the_augmentation_ideal">on Wikipedia</a>.  However, on Wikipedia all the "computation" is packed into the last sentence: </p>

<p>Maybe whether or not something is computation has to do with whether it is done on paper vs on a computer, rather than about what is being computed.  Like, sure, I can compute Kan extensions by hand, but not on terabytes of data - I need a computer for that.  Or sure, I can write a proof by hand, but sometimes need an automated theorem prover to solve the word problem for some category presentation for me, because I need to prove millions of expressions equal or not.  Although they are the same activity, the way they are engineered into existence is a lot different</p>

<p>It always annoys me when people try to defend human mathematicians vs. computers which would remplace them. Because making mathematics understanble by computers is equal to making mathematics better, both for humans and computers. I know an example where such a thing happened. There is a field in algebraic topology which is named Functor calculus, or Goodwillie calculus. It is named calculus because it looks like calculus but it is clearly not the same thing. Investigation in computer science led to linear logic, twenty years later, differential linear logic was invented, then differential categories, then cartesian differential categories and then in 2018, in this paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01930">Directional derivatives and higher order chain rules for abelian functor calculus</a> they found that functor calculus gives an example of cartesian differential category.</p>
<p>So, here progress in pure mathematics came from research in logic and an aera of logic which is tightely linked with the theory of programming languages. So, please, yes people were doing computations before computers exist, but what computers are doing is closer to what computation is really: a completely mechanical process. So it is the computers which are really doing computations. And helping them to do these computations, is a good thing for everybody. Being against the mechanization of mathematics is being against progress in mathematics.</p>

<p>As I tried to explain, I don't use "computation" in that sense when I talk about the computations I'm doing.  If you want me to use a different term when taking to you, like "calculation", that's fine.  I don't like arguing about words.</p>
<p>But whatever you call it, I am not seeking to carry out a completely mechanical process.  I could only do that <em>after</em> I figured out the things I'm trying to figure out.   Instead, I'm manipulating symbols, following rules, but with a free choice of which rule I apply at each time - and sometimes adding new rules:</p>

<p>I think that for you computing is thus the manipulation of formal rules, once you have specified what are the rules of the game ie. you have chosen the axioms and then you want to manipulate them to try proving something.</p>
<p>A stronger form a computation would be to have an algorithm which when you give him what you want to prove, give you a proof, ie. a way to apply the rules of the game to prove what you want to prove.</p>

<li>work in a precise context and try to find a proof of something, this is what I was talking about </li>

<p>Honnestly, I'm very far from understanding what is computation. I find it very intriguing that category theory seems more related to computation than set theory -- I say that because of all the work in computer science which uses category theory, whereas at the same time it looks also more abstract, and thus makes you think that you're not going to produce an algorithm with some pratical application from it.</p>

<p>To elaborate on what Mike is saying, one of the failure modes for programmers working in proof assistants is to try to "game" the proof assistant and produce a proof without understanding why it is true.  Even with automation, this doesn't work well - we teach that it is a sign to do more math and less programming.  So I absolutely agree that proof search in the sense of logic programming or automated theorem moving is usually at a lower level of abstraction that what mathematicians are doing in practice.  I don't expect machines to replace mathematicians, but I would like mathematicians to get as much as possible out of machines.   I think there's a lot computers have to offer mathematicians, but the best is yet to come- it will no doubt go beyond proof search</p>
