<p>I started working on logical graphs early in my undergrad years, after my first encounter with Peirce's <em>Collected Papers</em>, quickly followed  by my study of Spencer&nbsp;Brown's <em>Laws of Form</em>, and from the outset trying everything I could hack by way of syntax handlers and theorem provers in every mix of languages and machines I got my hands on.&nbsp; That combination of forces and media summed to form my current direction.</p>
<p>Peirce broke ground and laid the groundwork, Spencer&nbsp;Brown shored up the infrastructure of primary arithmetic and leveled the proving grounds to facilitate equational inference, and a host of computers supplied the real-world recalcitrance of matter, the resistance to facile simplicity, and the rebuke of all too facile reductionism.</p>

<p>Thanks, Chad, for that extremely nice treatment of Peirce's existential graphs at the &beta; level, tantamount to predicate calculus or first order logic as we know it today.</p>
<p>The logic of relatives and the mathematics of relations appear in a different light from the&nbsp;perspective of Peirce's own standpoint on logic, evolving as it does out of distinctive pragmatic and semiotic insights.&nbsp; The reflections of Spencer&nbsp;Brown afford a few angles Peirce anticipated but in a glass, darkly.&nbsp; And my own time tumbling recalcitrant calculi toward more ready tools for inquiry may add a few wrinkles, with luck to more than my own brow.&nbsp; All that will develop as we go.</p>

<p>Recently a few of us have been using the "cartesian bicategories of relations" of Carboni and Walters, in particular their string diagrams, as syntax for relations. The string diagrams in question are more or less a directed version of Peirce's lines of identity. They're usually described in terms of commutative special frobenius algebras. I suspect the reason we keep finding commutative special frobenius algebras is that they support lines of identity in this way.</p>

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00526">Knowledge Representation in Bicategories of Relations</a> is also drawn up in terms of string diagrams, as a way of explaining the W3C RDF and OWL standards. So it looks like we have a nice route from Peirce to RDF via string diagrams. Or the other way around: whichever route one prefers to travel.</p>

<p>It could also be that there are missing features not captured by these mappings, and that would be useful to know about. <br>
For one I think the bicategories of relations does not capture an aspect that requires Quads, or the deployment of RDF on web servers which would fall under pragmatics. (so there are spaces outside of Bicategories of relations that are important but not captured). <br>
It could be that the pieces missing for a full account of the semweb are the same as those <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="306979">@Jon Awbrey</span> feels is missing in the account of Peirce.<br>
After all the Web as an engineering project, is first of all a pragmatic one. (Well: engineers should use mathematics during the course of planning, designing and testing).</p>

<p>Once one has shown that a system of symbols and rules can be completely mapped into First Order Logic, you really are done with First Order Logic (FOL).  In FOL one can quantify over individuals, but not properties.  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="306979">@Jon Awbrey</span> in his search for Differential Logic through his question, "what do you have to do to change p?", is, in my opinion, looking for Second Order Logic (SOL).  In SOL you can assert that "a is a cube and b is a cube" and conclude that "there is a property that a and b share."  Sew <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/smcohen/120/SecondOrder.pdf">https://faculty.washington.edu/smcohen/120/SecondOrder.pdf</a>  You might also find Stanford University's take on ti interesting: <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-higher-order/">https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-higher-order/</a></p>
<p>My reason for being in this discussion is to explore the "Laws of Form"  (LoF) as articulated by George Spencer-Brown.  One of the important concepts in LoF is that they deal with distinctions and the naming of distinctions without specifying the domain of the distinction.  That makes them applicable to individual things or to any aspect, facet, property, or characteristic of an individual thing.  The LoF formalize the concept of "levels of abstraction", thus formally establishing the categories that Category Theory takes.</p>

<p>Henry, <br>
Model logic would be talking about the "predicates" and that is what is added when one goes to the second order.  If you want arcs and bubbles to talk about processes, then I suggest you explore the Data Flow Diagrams of "Structured Analysis and System Specification" by Tom DeMarco.   It takes you though the steps of modeling the current system, converting that physical model to a logical, i.e. implementation independent, model. of the current system, creating the logical model of the new system, and finally the physical model of the new system.  We used it, along with an automated documentation tool I developed to quadruple military software productivity in the early 1980s.   That is when I learned about sticking my head up above the crowd.  I bought extra copies after it wen out of print, and would be happy to send you one if you like. <br>
May the Form be with you!<br>
Best regards,<br>
Lyle</p>

<p>Speaking of Laws of Form: There is a paper called <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/323392663/The-Laws-of-Form-as-a-Categorical-Algebra">"The Laws of Form As A Categorical Algebra"</a>. It is not published anywhere and it seems to orginate from a sci.math.* mailing list. The author is not specified. Does anyone know who could be the author? ..It sounds quite interesting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, the categorical logic underlying the Spencer Brown system goes beyond merely a categorification of the proof theory of Boolean logic. It generalizes to a categorical proof theory for ortholattices; thus, also to Quantum logic. This serves to complete the analogy (Curry-Howard:Intuitionistic logic) = (???: “Ortho”-logic).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, the categorical logic underlying the Spencer Brown system goes beyond merely a categorification of the proof theory of Boolean logic. It generalizes to a categorical proof theory for ortholattices; thus, also to Quantum logic. This serves to complete the analogy (Curry-Howard:Intuitionistic logic) = (???: “Ortho”-logic).</p>

<p>People with backgrounds in computing, combinatorics, or graph theory would immediately recognize Spencer&nbsp;Brown’s expressions are isomorphic to what graph theorists know and love as “trees”, more specifically “rooted trees”, with a particular manner of attaching letters to the nodes to be described later.&nbsp; In those fields there’s a standard way of mapping trees to strings of parentheses and letters.&nbsp; This operation is called “traversing the tree” when one passes from trees to strings and the reverse operation is called “parsing the string” when one passes from strings to trees.</p>
<p>The transformation of Spencer&nbsp;Brown’s simple closed figures in the plane or his formal expressions of “crosses” into rooted trees, together with the further transformation of those two forms to “pointer data structures” in computer memory is, discussed in the following post on my blog.</p>

<p>Recently a few of us have been using the "cartesian bicategories of relations" of Carboni and Walters, in particular their string diagrams, as syntax for relations. The string diagrams in question are more or less a directed version of Peirce's lines of identity. They're usually described in terms of commutative special frobenius algebras. I suspect the reason we keep finding commutative special frobenius algebras is that they support lines of identity in this way.</p>

<p>To my way of thinking the above paragraph is one of the most radical passages in the history of logic, relativizing traditional assumptions of an absolute distinction between generals (universals) and individuals.&nbsp; Among other things, it pulls the rug out from under any standing for nominalism as opposed to realism about universals.</p>

<p>I have though, studied <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275965">@Evan Patterson</span>'s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00526">Knowledge Representation in Bicategories of Relations</a> carefully, as that directly applied to the work on the W3C Semantic Web <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-mt/">RDF</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/">OWL</a> which has occupied me for the past 16 years or so. </p>
<p>Tslil's work extends that to n-ary relations,  and helps put the work into context. <br>
N-ary relations could be of interest to the parallel ISO standardisation effort known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Logic">Comon Logic</a>, as I believe they have n-ary relations, and are following the same structure as RDF: that is starting by fixing semantics, and allow syntax to vary.</p>
<p>The beauty of binary relations is that they are very easy to explain, which, when dealing with standards, is very important.<br>
What I like about Evan's paper is that it also looks at complementing regular logic with its dual, giving us geometric logic, which is equivalent to full first order logic. Is that dual work being left out of these  developments?</p>

<p>In his presentation <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="315499">@tslil (they)</span> mentions contexts which are somehow associated with n-ary relations. That sounds very intriguing. I have the feeling that contexts emerge out of <a href="https://gitlab.com/web-cats/CG/-/issues/24">higher ordered networks</a> such as simplicial sets.  As <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="315499">@tslil (they)</span> is a student of <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277432">@Emily Riehl</span> and her book on ncategories starts with simplicial sets (the first 2 pages I was able to follow!), that seems like where it could be going. That is the word "context" has quite a history in logic and philosophy (<a href="https://gitlab.com/web-cats/CG/-/issues/26">a few pointers</a>) which in my view relates it to modal logic, so I hope it is not used just as a shorthand for nary relations... (unless there is some structural magic to n-ary relations that I am unaware of).</p>

<p>I don't know where "regular" comes from, but it is logic with just Truth, conjunction, existential quantification and equality. <a href="/user_uploads/21317/CuocYPKx_Lr0dnR_aOdrXeRU/Screen-Shot-2021-08-01-at-12.53.03.png">Screenshot from minute 10:21 of the talk</a><br>
That seems particularly useful to make factual statements, that one can add to a database. Say if one has a database in which one only wants to put true statements, then one can just always add (conjunction) new true statements without worrying about their interaction with other statements. </p>

<p>There's a process called Morleyization for turning any (infinitary) first order theory into a coherent (resp. geometric) theory with the same models in any Boolean topos, in particular giving the same Set models, so geometric logic is as expressive in that sense.</p>

<p>As a thorough reader of Nietzsche (as I was 16 in the early 1980ies) I would have also been very suspicious of the semantic web, had I been convinced that I needed to go through upper ontologies, which would it seem be a form of Platonism. That worry was put to rest for me by reading Ruth Garett Millikan's <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/language-thought-and-other-biological-categories">Thought, Language and Other Biological Categories</a>, a beautiful book that puts language and thought back into the biological reproductive space. That is a thought that pre-covid would have many people tremble. But I think we are now beyond that.  The semantic web should be looked at as an evolutionary writing system, that grows by applications being used to intermediate human agents to other human and robotic agents. There is no need for a final upper ontology to get that to work. <br>
At the same time, I am not against research in that space either. There is something about schemas that still has that Platonic flavor: functors from small shapes in the heavenly space of forms to our mixed world of Sets...</p>

<p>There is also the continuation of work from Modal Logic by David Lewis in a pragmatic direction from his student Robert Brandom,  (very much appreciated by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="302507">@David Corfield</span>)  which I think would be also compatible with the semantic web. As apps intermediate humans that are trying to coordinate actions to get <strong>things done</strong>, these apps need to keep track of who said what (context) in order to allow the person using the app to decide whether to trust a statement found on the web, and use it for further reasoning. This is the game of giving and asking for reasons - which on the semweb is not fully automatiseable.</p>

<p>Modal Logic, along with logics for tense and intension, have been a recurring (recursèd) topic for as long as I can remember, big debates going back to my Quine days, and it just came up again on both the Ontolog and Peirce lists, but I pretty much said the best I know some years ago.</p>
<p>It is critical to understand the pragmatic semiotic information-theoretic perspective going back to Peirce's earliest  breakthroughs well anticipated and avoided in advance all the pet boondoggles of logical atomism and so-called analytic philosophy.</p>

<p>Minsky and Papert’s <em>Perceptrons</em> was the work that nudged me over the line from gestalt psychology, psychophysics, relational biology, etc. and made me believe AI could fly.&nbsp; I later found out a lot of people thought it had thrown cold water on the subject but that was not my sense of it.</p>
<p>The real reason Rosenblatt’s perceptrons short-shrift XOR and EQ among the sixteen boolean functions on two variables is the adoption of a particular role for neurons in the activity of the brain and a particular model of how neurons serve computation, namely, as threshold activation devices.&nbsp; It is as if we tried to do mathematics using only the inequality <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>≤</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\le</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.7719400000000001em;vertical-align:-0.13597em;"></span><span class="mrel">≤</span></span></span></span> instead of using equations.&nbsp; Sure, we can express equations in roundabout ways but why tolerate the resulting inefficiency?&nbsp; As a final observation, <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>≤</mo><mi>y</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x \le y</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.7719400000000001em;vertical-align:-0.13597em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">x</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mrel">≤</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">y</span></span></span></span> for boolean variables <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>y</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x, y</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">x</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.16666666666666666em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">y</span></span></span></span> is equivalent to <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi><mo>⇒</mo><mi>y</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x \Rightarrow y</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">x</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mrel">⇒</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">y</span></span></span></span> so this fits right in with the weakness of implicational inference compared to equational inference rules.</p>
<p>But there are other models for the role neurons play in the activity of the brain and the work they do in computation.</p>

<p>The Peirce List discussion on &ldquo;thinking in diagrams vs thinking in words&rdquo; called to mind the time I spent a hefty sum on a copy of Stjernfelt’s <em>Diagrammatology</em> which ran to over 500&nbsp;pages with many sections in very small print and had just over 50&nbsp;diagrams between the covers.</p>
<p>In the same way, the real Versus monopolizing our attention here is not so much the difference between &ldquo;thinking in diagrams&rdquo; and &ldquo;thinking in words&rdquo; as the difference between &ldquo;thinking in words about thinking in diagrams&rdquo; and &ldquo;thinking in words about thinking in words&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Those of us who have been developing &ldquo;moving&nbsp;pictures&rdquo; from the very get-go have learned to see things rather differently.</p>
