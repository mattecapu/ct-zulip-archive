<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>In a current project we have the following situation. For a category<br>
we are attempting to define, we know what the objects are, and also<br>
the morphisms. Unfortunately we do not have an obvious composition<br>
operation. What we do have is a "colimit" operation, which operates on<br>
a directed graph labelled by our objects and morphisms, and returns a<br>
putative colimit object equipped with a family of morphisms in the<br>
usual way (or fails.)</p>
<p>We then define the composite of morphisms A-&gt;B,  B-&gt;C  to be the<br>
colimit of the diagram A-&gt;B-&gt;C. We then check that this composition<br>
operation satisfies the axioms of a category, and that our earlier<br>
colimit construction is indeed an actual colimit with respect to the<br>
compositional structure. It seems that everything works fine, and we<br>
are happy.</p>
<p>My question is whether this has any precedent in the literature. The<br>
situation as I have described it is a bit simplified, in reality there<br>
is some higher categorical stuff going on. Personally I'm sure I've<br>
read similar things in the literature in the past but I can't track<br>
them down now that I actually need them. The nLab article on<br>
"composition" has some stuff about this with regard to transfinite<br>
composition, but we're not trying to do anything transfinite here.</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>
Jamie</p>

<p>Hi Jamie,</p>
<p>That does sound interesting. Did you look at:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kelly, G. M., &amp; Le Creurer, I. J. On the monadicity over graphs of<br>
  categories with limits. Cahiers de Topologie et G\'eom\'etrie<br>
  Diff\'erentielle Cat\'egoriques, 1997(38), 179–191.</li>
</ul>
<p>This paper, among other things, shows that categories with limits<br>
indexed by finite acyclic directed graphs are monadic over directed<br>
graphs. It seems like you could be describing an algebra structure for<br>
this monad (which is a fortiori a category). The paper gives a fairly<br>
explicit presentation of this monad by generators and relations, so you<br>
should be able to check fairly easily if that is indeed what is going<br>
on.</p>

<p>Composition of distributors or profunctors would be an example. But<br>
composition is only defined up to isomorphism and so one gets a<br>
bicategory. This was done in the second half of the sixties by Benabou.</p>
<p>But the situation can be rectified when redefining distributors from A to B<br>
as cocontinuous functors from Psh(A) to Psh(B).</p>

<p>PS I take the opportunity to thank Bob for organising and moderating the<br>
categories list for such a long time.<br>
And thanks to the people who have taken over! I missed it for quite some<br>
time already!</p>
