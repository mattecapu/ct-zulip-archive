<p>Excerpt from my memorial address for Saunders MacLane, about events<br>
around 1971 or 1972:</p>
<p>There is a terminological comment in Categories for the Working<br>
Mathematician that I especially like and would like to share with you.<br>
It concerns the substitution of monad for triple as the name of a<br>
concept that all mathematicians here should know. He writes “The<br>
frequent but unfortunate use of the word ‘triple’ in this sense has<br>
achieved a maximum of needless confusion, what with the conflict with<br>
ordered triple, plus the use of associated terms such as ‘triple derived<br>
functors’ for functors which are not three times derived from anything<br>
in the world. Hence the term ‘monad’.” One reason I like this passage is<br>
that it is a beautiful illustration of the vividness of his writing, his<br>
sheer verve. Another is that it is so characteristic of his manner of<br>
arguing a point. But the third is personal. In the first draft he used<br>
the word triple, and I won him over. I had just defined operads, and I<br>
had coined that word to go well with monad.</p>
