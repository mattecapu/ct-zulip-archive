Subject: Higgs object</p>
<p>Dear topos theorists,</p>
<p>Recently I found myself coming across Higgs' object.</p>
<p>I only know two references that mention it, the Elephant, and Freyd's<br>
paper "Choice and well-ordering".</p>
<p>Is there an original paper by Denis Higgs, or at least a manuscript by<br>
him that you may have seen or have available?</p>
<p>When was the first time the Higgs' object showed up in topos theory?</p>
<p>References or recollections are welcome.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Martin</p>

Subject: Re: Higgs object</p>
<p>I got lots of private replies - thanks.</p>
<p>The most informative one was that Hugo Volger published in 1975 a paper that includes "Higgs involution theorem", namely that any embedding of \Omega into itself is an involution (and hence an isomorphism).</p>
<p>(1) Hugo Volger. "Ultrafilters, ultrapowers and finiteness in a topos". Journal of Pure and Applied Algebra 6 (1975) 345-356</p>
<p>(2) Then there is Johnstone's paper "Automorphisms of \Omega". Algebra Universalis, 9 (1979) 1-7.</p>
<p>And then the references I mentioned below already when I asked the question, the Elephant and a paper by Freyd.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the Higgs object was introduced by Johnstone in the above paper (and repeated in the Elephant). In the internal language, it is the object {q : \Omega | for all p : Omega, p or (p implies q)}.</p>
<p>So the answers didn't uncover anything new, in terms of mathematics, but they include the new historical fact, to me, that it was Volger who first published Higgs' Involution Theorem.</p>
<p>There doesn't seem to be anything published by Higgs himself about this.</p>

Subject: Re: Higgs object</p>
<p>Dear Martin,</p>
<p>Apologies for not responding sooner; I was busy over the weekend, and<br>
I wanted to consult my own copy of `Automorphisms of Omega' before<br>
replying.</p>
<p>I think I learned of Higgs's result, that every monic endomorphism<br>
of Omega is an involution, from Gavin Wraith in about 1973. As far<br>
as I know, Denis never wrote it down. When I saw the result mentioned<br>
in Volger's 1975 paper, it occurred to me that someone ought to<br>
work out an explicit description of the automorphism group; this may<br>
well have been known to Higgs, but I didn't get it from either Wraith<br>
or Volger. I also described the internal object of automorphisms, so<br>
I could be credited with having invented the Higgs object. But it was<br>
Peter Freyd who gave it that name, when he realized it played an<br>
important role in his work on choice and well-ordering; it's possible<br>
that Peter had evidence that Denis had in fact defined it, but I<br>
never saw it.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>
Peter Johnstone</p>
