<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>From March 1990 until recently it was my privilege to moderate the categories mailing list. For a couple of years it has been my intention to pass the list to a new moderator, but I was too slow to act. Changes to IT service at my former employer, Mount Allison University, abruptly made it impossible for me to continue running the list.</p>
<p>Those changes were unexpected for me, but I have been away from the campus for over three years and was not aware. The IT staff at Mount Allison have always been very supportive of the list and I thank them for their more than three decades of generous assistance.</p>
<p>It is a reassuring pleasure to know that the list is now in the capable hands of JS Lemay who kindly accepted the invitation to revive it. I am very grateful. Moreover, there is no one better suited to the role and our community is fortunate to have him moderating. I am also very happy that the new home of the list is Macquarie.</p>
<p>Best wishes to everyone. I am hoping to see many of you in the not distant future,<br>
Bob Rosebrugh</p>

<p>Dear Bob,</p>
<p>many, many thanks for your visionary adventure, more than 30 years<br>
ago, into the digital world of communication. This was not only a way of<br>
connecting people with same interests, but also the installment of a<br>
solid platform for the promotion of category theory and the exchange of<br>
exciting new ideas.</p>
<p>I hope to see you soon (at CT 2024 or in Nice ?),</p>
<p>All the best,<br>
Clemens.</p>

<p>Just writing to add one more voice of gratitude to the chorus — thanks, Bob, for all the diligent and tactful moderation work, keeping the mailing list running fruitfully for longer now than many (?most) of us have been in the field.  It’s been a model of moderation, keeping things civil and on-topic without discouraging people from wide-ranging and often lively discussion — a difficult balancing act that’s often unnoticed as long as it’s maintained!</p>
<p>With much appreciation,<br>
–Peter.</p>

Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>From March 1990 until recently it was my privilege to moderate the<br>
categories mailing list. For a couple of years it has been my intention<br>
to pass the list to a new moderator, but I was too slow to act. Changes<br>
to IT service at my former employer, Mount Allison University, abruptly<br>
made it impossible for me to continue running the list.</p>
<p>Those changes were unexpected for me, but I have been away from the<br>
campus for over three years and was not aware. The IT staff at Mount<br>
Allison have always been very supportive of the list and I thank them<br>
for their more than three decades of generous assistance.</p>
<p>It is a reassuring pleasure to know that the list is now in the capable<br>
hands of JS Lemay who kindly accepted the invitation to revive it. I am<br>
very grateful. Moreover, there is no one better suited to the role and<br>
our community is fortunate to have him moderating. I am also very happy<br>
that the new home of the list is Macquarie.</p>
<p>Best wishes to everyone. I am hoping to see many of you in the not<br>
distant future, Bob Rosebrugh</p>

<p>Just writing to add one more voice of gratitude to the chorus — thanks, Bob, for all the diligent and tactful moderation work, keeping the mailing list running fruitfully for longer now than many (?most) of us have been in the field.  It’s been a model of moderation, keeping things civil and on-topic without discouraging people from wide-ranging and often lively discussion — a difficult balancing act that’s often unnoticed as long as it’s maintained!</p>
<p>With much appreciation,<br>
–Peter.</p>

<p>Dear Bob,</p>
<p>I would like to join my voice to the chorus: your contribution to  the life of the community of category theorists cannot be priced. There was a lot of wisdom in your actions as a moderator. I am glad you have resisted me occasionally.</p>
<p>Best wishes,<br>
André</p>
