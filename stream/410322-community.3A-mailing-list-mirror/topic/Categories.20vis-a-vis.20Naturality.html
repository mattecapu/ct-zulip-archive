<p>Dear All,  </p>
<p>Consider a category of objects (say, cats). Going by a naive  <br>
understanding of the notion of category, every object of a category  <br>
partakes in an essence/abstract general/theory that is characteristic  <br>
of the category (cf. catness; whatever that might be). Doesn't it  <br>
immediately follow from this commonplace understanding of category  <br>
that morphisms of a category are necessarily natural transformations  <br>
preserving the abstract essence characterizing the category (cf.  <br>
playful cat ---&gt; pensive cat). Of course, this is an informal  <br>
paraphrasing of "Yoneda showed that maps in any category can be  <br>
represented as natural transformations" (Lawvere &amp; Schanuel,  <br>
Conceptual Mathematics, p. 378). Isn't this reason enough to think of  <br>
category theory as the theory of naturality?  </p>
<p>Happy Monday :)  </p>
<p>Thanking you,  <br>
Yours truly,  <br>
posina  <br>
P.S. Given that all morphisms, beginning with functions between sets  <br>
(<a href="https://conceptualmathematics.wordpress.com/2022/08/30/functions-are-natural-transformations">https://conceptualmathematics.wordpress.com/2022/08/30/functions-are-
natural-
transformations/</a>),  <br>
can be construed as natural transformations, one added value of  <br>
baptizing category theory as the theory of naturality is that it  <br>
brings into figural salience for all see that the constrasting notion  <br>
is unnatural (as in miracles) and not social or culture (since they  <br>
too don't change willy-nilly). To be clear, highlighting natural is  <br>
not intended to belittle the categorical nature of our everyday  <br>
experience (Kandel et al., Principles of Neural Science, pp. 621-637).  </p>

Subject: Re: Categories vis-a-vis Naturality</p>
<p>Dear Professors: Street, Rosebrugh, Lemay, Taylor et al.,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for positng my working-question (Lemay :)</p>
<p>I'll write to you again after thinking through the relations between<br>
mathematical methods, models, theories, and examples, especially from<br>
your perspective (as it appears from your response, Lemay ;)</p>
<p>I'll also write again after carefully studying Professor Street's<br>
presentation, which is about (the elemental?) natural transformations<br>
(as in: natural transformation is required to define functor which, in<br>
turn, is required to define category).</p>
<p>For now, in the spirit of full disclosure, natural transformation, in<br>
the sense of structure-respecting maps, appear to account for the<br>
effectiveness of mathematics in natural sciences, along the following<br>
lines (open to their fate ;)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We are given 'change', which we objectify (e.g., physical<br>
constrasts (particulars) are sensed by featherless biped brains ;)<br>
objects are perceived; geometric objectification of objects as<br>
structures is made possible thanks to our minds (mental concepts i.e.,<br>
properties along with their mutual determinations).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given that a concept (abstract general) that is invariant across a<br>
given category of experiences (planned perceptions) is given in the<br>
given (change), surely, the given makes it possible to objecfity (the<br>
invariant of a category of the given changes).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Isn't it yet another reason to reorient science/mathematics towards<br>
"the given" and away from its (pathalogical ;) fixation on) "exits"<br>
(see Rosebrugh &amp; Lawvere, Sets for Mathematics, p. 240)?</p>
<p>I look forward to your corrections (unvarinshed ;)</p>
<p>Happy Weekend :)</p>
<p>Thanking you,<br>
Yours truly,<br>
posina<br>
P.S. Professor Street, I recently started working my way, inspired by<br>
Professor by F. William Lawvere's Perugia Notes<br>

Subject: Re: Categories vis-a-vis Naturality</p>
<p>I don't know about all that. You are going more deep into the philosophical world at this point and leaving out of the world of math. At some point, you get so disillusioned down this train of what language should be used that there seems to be less and less of a point. Everything becomes so pretentious and so above-it-all that it circles back around and becomes nonsense that we can only think about rather than do anything with.</p>
<p>Granted, I am not sure this is the appropriate place to post this type of flowery discussion of a philosophical pondering of what is real and what isn't with regards to mathematical language. Neither do I think philosophical musing will make you and less or more proficient at category theory.</p>
<p>You can look at all of mathematics at its most basic as "I want to compare these two things" (things being statements, sets, categories, etc...).

<p>I think Professor Street said it best, however, when he said "that would be like saying group theory is the theory of permutations". It is true that groups embed into permutations but the image of the imbedding is entirely dependent on the group.

<p>In the same sense, the things you are attempting to study with natural transformations become divorced of meaning without the context you are working with.</p>
<p>All the fancy words and terms you used, don't really do anything for understanding mathematics. You are trying too hard to sound smart and you come away not helping anyone understand what is going on which is the job of a mathematician and the point of mathematical papers.</p>
<p>I come away from this and I am not sure you know what you are talking about or if you are trying to sound smart and coming up with stuff on the fly. It doesn't sound like you are very confident and as though you are compensating . You need to focus on thinking about and writing mathematics in a way that is concise and gives your audience a feeling that you know what you are talking about and don't have to depend on entertaining your audience with flowery language.</p>

<p>You are welcome. I am not a Doctor yet just to let you know.</p>
<p>I was into the musings of trying to understand category theory in this type of abstract sense only a few years ago.</p>
<p>From experience and conversations with people who do have the Doctor title and have years of experience beyond me, this type of musing about abstract theory in this level of abstractness is not particularly interesting and it causes more burnout then trying to work with tetra-categories and a theory involving them.</p>

Subject: Re: Categories vis-a-vis Naturality</p>
<p>I am enjoying the renewed liveliness of the list.</p>
<p>However....</p>
<p>I am reminded of the dictum "all concepts are Kan extensions". It is true, in the same way that "all concepts are terminal objects" .... in a carefully chosen category. In an (infinity, 1)-category people would talk about contractibility of a space of choices. But in my work in category theory I have never explicitly used Kan extensions, whereas I have used limits, colimits, adjoints, Yoneda, naturality (yes) etc.</p>
<p>It is this reductionism of all things to a single type of object that can lead to the way set theorists had reduced mathematics to the \in relation. Debates over the "fundamental-ness" of \in vs composition by set theorist logicians and category theorists were not, ultimately, productive, despite philosophical arguments brought to bear by both sides.</p>
<p>The renewed love for the list will, I hope, not be dampened, by a discussion of minutiae arguing over this or that philosophical point. I think it a interesting point to ponder, to discuss at a conference, to chat about on the web in more focussed locations. But in a mailing list with presumably hundreds of recipients, it is good to be mindful of not overwhelming all of them with ideas still in the gestational phase.</p>

<p>For some purposes it is genuinely useful to know that all categorical<br>
concepts can be reduced to "terminal object", or that the entire theory<br>
of deterministic computation can be emulated within group theory.  But<br>
that doesn't mean that this should always be done! Mathematics is all<br>

Subject: Re: Categories vis-a-vis Naturality</p>
<p>In the middle of Posina's original message was "Doesn't it immediately follow from this commonplace understanding of category that morphisms of a category are necessarily natural transformations ..."</p>
<p>My immediate reaction at that point was the following.</p>
<p>Theorem.  The functor category C^1 is a representation of C (that is, a full embedding of C in C^1) in which the morphisms of C are represented as natural transformations.</p>
<p>But to call this theorem a consequence of "catness" would appear to be overkill.  Just as Russell didn't need the existence of God as an axiom (to inject the apparently desired note of philosophy into this thread), neither does this theorem need anything more than preservation of units (in this case the unit of 1's only object) and that the unit at each object of C is simultaneously a left and right unit for composition with morphisms incident on that object.</p>
<p>Other than for composition with units, composition at an object of C needn't be associative, or even to exist, just so long as C^1's composition imitates that of C.</p>

<p>From experience and conversations with people who do have the Doctor title and have years of experience beyond me, this type of musing about abstract theory in this level of abstractness is not particularly interesting and it causes more burnout then trying to work with tetra-categories and a theory involving them.</p>

<p>Ideas from the "whining schoolboy, with his satchel ... unwilling to school"? Allowed or not? Yes, some, why not, but again, it's up to the moderator.</p>
<p>"Then the lover, with a woeful ballad ..." I haven't seen much of that. Maybe good so. Ballad easily turns to sallad, like in FoM.</p>
<p>"Then a soldier ... jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel". I've seen those, indeed "seeking the bubble reputation, even in the cannon's mouth". More of that in FoM, I would say, less within the catlist. Maybe FoM is kind of a doglist.</p>
<p>"And then the justice, In fair round belly with good capon lined, With eyes severe and beard of formal cut, Full of wise saws and modern instances;" Yes. This is catlist more than FoM. Nobody named. Everybody highly respected. They've all earned it.</p>
<p>"The sixth age shifts Into the lean and slippered pantaloon, for men, with spectacles on nose, for women, and pouch on side, for anyone who prefers to look that way". They should speak more, write more. Please do. If not, passing between generations happens over a shorter interval for generations. If that interval restricts to [quick in quarrel, full of wise saws and modern instances], iterative development will be nothing more. Nothing less either.</p>
<p>At "Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything" there is no more, or, there is everything needed for continuous development across generations.</p>

<p>I am reminded of the dictum "all concepts are Kan extensions". It is true, in the same way that "all concepts are terminal objects" .... in a carefully chosen category. In an (infinity, 1)-category people would talk about contractibility of a space of choices. But in my work in category theory I have never explicitly used Kan extensions, whereas I have used limits, colimits, adjoints, Yoneda, naturality (yes) etc.</p>
<p>It is this reductionism of all things to a single type of object that can lead to the way set theorists had reduced mathematics to the \in relation. Debates over the "fundamental-ness" of \in vs composition by set theorist logicians and category theorists were not, ultimately, productive, despite philosophical arguments brought to bear by both sides.</p>
<p>The renewed love for the list will, I hope, not be dampened, by a discussion of minutiae arguing over this or that philosophical point. I think it a interesting point to ponder, to discuss at a conference, to chat about on the web in more focussed locations. But in a mailing list with presumably hundreds of recipients, it is good to be mindful of not overwhelming all of them with ideas still in the gestational phase.</p>

<p>I don't know about all that. You are going more deep into the philosophical world at this point and leaving out of the world of math. At some point, you get so disillusioned down this train of what language should be used that there seems to be less and less of a point. Everything becomes so pretentious and so above-it-all that it circles back around and becomes nonsense that we can only think about rather than do anything with.</p>
<p>Granted, I am not sure this is the appropriate place to post this type of flowery discussion of a philosophical pondering of what is real and what isn't with regards to mathematical language. Neither do I think philosophical musing will make you and less or more proficient at category theory.</p>
<p>You can look at all of mathematics at its most basic as "I want to compare these two things" (things being statements, sets, categories, etc...). It turns out that natural transformations give a very fundamental and general view on how to compare two categories which encapsulate alot of important things in mathematics.</p>
<p>I think Professor Street said it best, however, when he said "that would be like saying group theory is the theory of permutations". It is true that groups embed into permutations but the image of the imbedding is entirely dependent on the group. You know nothing of the permutations you picked otherwise and at that point, specifically for a large enough composite integer, that statement doesn't help you study the group very much.</p>
<p>In the same sense, the things you are attempting to study with natural transformations become divorced of meaning without the context you are working with.</p>
<p>All the fancy words and terms you used, don't really do anything for understanding mathematics. You are trying too hard to sound smart and you come away not helping anyone understand what is going on which is the job of a mathematician and the point of mathematical papers.</p>
<p>I come away from this and I am not sure you know what you are talking about or if you are trying to sound smart and coming up with stuff on the fly. It doesn't sound like you are very confident and as though you are compensating . You need to focus on thinking about and writing mathematics in a way that is concise and gives your audience a feeling that you know what you are talking about and don't have to depend on entertaining your audience with flowery language.</p>

<p>Dear Professors: Street, Rosebrugh, Lemay, Taylor et al.,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for positng my working-question (Lemay :)</p>
<p>I'll write to you again after thinking through the relations between<br>
mathematical methods, models, theories, and examples, especially from<br>
your perspective (as it appears from your response, Lemay ;)</p>
<p>I'll also write again after carefully studying Professor Street's<br>
presentation, which is about (the elemental?) natural transformations<br>
(as in: natural transformation is required to define functor which, in<br>
turn, is required to define category).</p>
<p>For now, in the spirit of full disclosure, natural transformation, in<br>
the sense of structure-respecting maps, appear to account for the<br>
effectiveness of mathematics in natural sciences, along the following<br>
lines (open to their fate ;)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We are given 'change', which we objectify (e.g., physical<br>
constrasts (particulars) are sensed by featherless biped brains ;)<br>
objects are perceived; geometric objectification of objects as<br>
structures is made possible thanks to our minds (mental concepts i.e.,<br>
properties along with their mutual determinations).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given that a concept (abstract general) that is invariant across a<br>
given category of experiences (planned perceptions) is given in the<br>
given (change), surely, the given makes it possible to objecfity (the<br>
invariant of a category of the given changes).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Isn't it yet another reason to reorient science/mathematics towards<br>
"the given" and away from its (pathalogical ;) fixation on) "exits"<br>
(see Rosebrugh &amp; Lawvere, Sets for Mathematics, p. 240)?</p>
<p>I look forward to your corrections (unvarinshed ;)</p>
<p>Happy Weekend :)</p>

P.S. Professor Street, I recently started working my way, inspired by<br>

that required category.</p>

Subject: Re: Categories vis-a-vis Naturality</p>
<p>I agree. In my first-year graduate course on category theory, after I've<br>
shown that the three concepts <code>terminal object', </code>right adjoint' and<br>
<code>limit' are all interdefinable, I jokingly add </code>You might say that<br>
category-theorists have only ever had one good idea, and all we do<br>
is to keep dressing it up in new clothes'. (The <code>one good idea' is of
course the notion of universal element, which comes from Yoneda.)
But the </code>dressing up in new clothes' does matter: the introduction of<br>
(appropriate!) new concepts is an important aid to understanding. So<br>
I think it is <code>selling category theory short' to describe it as </code>just'<br>
the study of naturality.</p>
