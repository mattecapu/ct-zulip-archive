<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>I tried to save your site on <a href="https://archive.ph/&lt;https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/1zR5CGv0Z6fn4RgYiKl1P0?domain=archive.ph/">https://archive.ph/&lt;https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/1zR5CGv0Z6fn4RgYiKl1P0?domain=archive.ph/</a>&gt;. Their mission is to preserve webpages.</p>
<p>Amazingly, though, while the page loads fine for me, archive is getting 404 from it! Universities tend to underpay their network engineers and end up with weird firewall policies. If anyone could simply save the whole web site, put it up on a private node for 30 min, and direct archive to it, archive will save it.</p>
<p>I wouldn't think that the chairman not responding necessarily means that there is a policy about removing people's webpages. All network engineers were someone's students, just like our students often become someone's network engineers. After a while, when it becomes clear that the network is living its life out of anyone's control, the chairpeople give up trying to answer such questions.</p>
<p>I try to remember what the mathematician said in the first Jurassic Park movie: "Nature will find the way."</p>

There is one new thing added: my original thesis, retyped.  It is really mainly of historical interest.  The main result is the direct construction of the shuffle idempotents in dimensions 2,3,4.

<p>Any idea why Mount Alison shut down the list?  Computer storage is so cheap these days it hardly seems worth the effort.</p>

<p>Happy to report that your site is safely archived on the Wayback Machine, as seen here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231101160028/https://www.math.mcgill.ca/barr/&lt;https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/nP6pCoV1Y2S91p2Di1iQ7D?domain=web.archive.org/">https://web.archive.org/web/20231101160028/https://www.math.mcgill.ca/barr/&lt;https://protect-au.mimecast.com/s/nP6pCoV1Y2S91p2Di1iQ7D?domain=web.archive.org/</a>&gt;</p>
<p>Your retyped thesis seems to have been uploaded recently and was missing but I was able to request a fresh capture of the site to day and it’s now present.</p>
<p>I think Dusko’s archive may have been into an issue with McGill math changing their domain name; it seems unreliable to get to the old domain where your site is hosted.</p>
