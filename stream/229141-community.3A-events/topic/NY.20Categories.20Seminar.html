<p>· Speaker: Nicholas Meadows, Haifa University.<br>
· Date and Time: Wednesday April 22, 2020, 7:00 - 8:30 PM., Zoom Meeting.<br>
· Title: Higher Homotopy Operations in (\infty, 1)-categories.</p>
<p>· Abstract: Traditionally, higher homotopy operations have three<br>
primary applications in homotopy theory: generating elements in the<br>
higher homotopy groups of spheres, as an obstruction theory to<br>
rectifying homotopy commutative diagrams and describing differentials<br>
in the spectral sequence of a (co)simplicial space. In this talk, we<br>
will define the spiral spectral sequence (which recovers the classical<br>
Bousfield-Friedlander spectral sequence from the E^{2} page on) in an<br>
arbitrary simplicial model category and describe the differentials in<br>
terms of higher homotopy operations. We will also explain how to<br>
represent elements in the filtration of the spiral spectral sequence<br>
as higher homotopy operations. Finally, we will sketch how one can<br>
define analogous higher homotopy operations in quasi-categories and<br>
simplicially enriched categories. .</p>

<p>Yes it shows time for the timezone of the viewers, but when one adds events it should be possible to specify which timezone you're inputting<br>
So write your times, read your times. Easy.</p>

<p>The categorical content was rather speculative and conversational -- the group is just looking into those methods. The question posed was sort of what the notions of "universality" in terms of universal turing machine have in common with other notions of universality that all regard some system being able to simulate other systems of the same sort. The main mathematical result driving this is in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03529">https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03529</a> and the discussion was around how to use category theory to sort of more closely couple these sorts of results, and also regarding the relationship or not of universality on the one hand (in the "universal turing machine sense") and undecidability (in the godel sense) on the other. David -- I made sure to point out to  Gemma De las Cuevas and Noson Yanofsky both your recent paper on minimal criteria for lawvere's diagonalization  that helped shed some light (in my mind) on some of distinctions one should be worried about :-)</p>

<p>I should have advertised the spring semester talks. They're almost over (though prior ones available on youtube). The two remaining talks are tonight and next wednesday:</p>
<p>Speaker:     Alex Sorokin, Northeastern University.<br>
Date and Time:     Wednesday April 27, 2022, 7:00 - 8:30 PM., on Zoom.<br>
Title:     The defect of a profunctor .</p>
<p>Abstract: In the mid 1960s Auslander introduced a notion of the defect of a finitely presented functor on a module category. In 2021 Martsinkovsky generalized it to arbitrary additive functors. In this talk I will show how to define a defect of any enriched functor with a codomain a cosmos. Under mild assumptions, the covariant (contravariant) defect functor turns out to be a left covariant (right contravariant) adjoint to the covariant (contravariant) Yoneda embedding. Both defects can be defined for any profunctor enriched in a cosmos V. They happen to be adjoints to the embeddings of V-Cat in V-Prof. Moreover, the Isbell duals of a profunctor are completely determined by the profunctor's covariant and contravariant defects. These results are based on applications of the Tensor-Hom-Cotensor adjunctions and the (co)end calculus.</p>
<p>Speaker:     Gershom Bazerman, Arista Networks.<br>
Date and Time:     Wednesday May 4, 2022, 7:00 - 8:30 PM., on Zoom.<br>
Title:     Classes of Closed Monoidal Functors which Admit Infinite Traversals.</p>
<p>Abstract: In functional programming, functors that are equipped with a traverse operation can be thought of as data structures which permit an in-order traversal of their elements. This has been made precise by the correspondence between traversable functors and finitary containers (aka polynomial functors). This correspondence was established in the context of total, necessarily terminating, functions. However, the Haskell language is non-strict and permits functions that do not terminate. It has long been observed that traversals can at times, in practice, operate over infinite lists, for example in distributing the Reader applicative. We present work in progress that characterizes when this situation occurs, making use of the toolkit of guarded recursion.</p>
