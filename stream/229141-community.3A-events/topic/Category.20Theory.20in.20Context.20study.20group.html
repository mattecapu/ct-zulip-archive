<p><strong><em>Applied Category Theory Discord Server</em></strong> has a study group that is reading <strong>Category Theory in Context</strong> by Emily Riehl. We are currently on page 15 and actually reading the book together. It is a small but dedicated study group. We finished reading <strong>Joy of Abstraction</strong> by Eugenia Cheng and this book is our next challenge. We read it and talk about it. We have one member that is better versed in category theory than the rest of us and so we are learning a lot. If you are a beginner in Category Theory and would like to learn it with others in order to apply it to your specialty outside mathematics then this is the group for you. Go to <a href="https://discord.gg/kFARMG89kK">https://discord.gg/kFARMG89kK</a> There are 524 members on the server but not much action other than the Category Theory Study Groups we host. But maybe you could liven things up if you joined. We are open to sponsoring multiple study groups. <br>
One of our other study groups has read Lawvere's <strong>Conceptual Mathematics</strong> as well as delving into Topoi and made inroads into Seven Sketches. If you have a hankering to study Category Theory with others or exchange ideas about how to apply category theory to other subjects and disciplines then this small but active community might be what you are looking for.</p>
