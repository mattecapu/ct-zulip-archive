<h1>CALL FOR PAPERS</h1>
<p>Fourth Annual International Conference on Applied Category Theory (ACT 2021)</p>
<p>12 - 16 July, 2021, Cambridge, United Kingdom (and online)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/act2021">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/act2021</a></p>
<hr>
<p>The Fourth International Conference on Applied Category Theory will take place at the Computer Laboratory of the University of Cambridge on 12-16 July, 2021, preceded by the Adjoint School 2021 on 5-9 July. This conference follows previous events at MIT, Oxford and Leiden.</p>
<p>Applied category theory is a topic of interest for a growing community of researchers, interested in studying many different kinds of systems using category-theoretic tools. These systems are found across computer science, mathematics, and physics, as well as in social science, linguistics, cognition, and neuroscience. The background and experience of our members is as varied as the systems being studied. The goal of the Applied Category Theory conference series is to bring researchers together, disseminate the latest results, and facilitate further development of the field.</p>
<p>We accept submissions of both original research papers, and work accepted/submitted/ published elsewhere. Accepted original research papers will be invited for publication in a proceedings volume. The keynote addresses will be drawn from the best accepted papers. The conference will include an industry showcase event.</p>
<p>We hope to run the conference as a hybrid event, with physical attendees present in Cambridge, and other participants taking part online. However, due to the state of the pandemic, the possibility of in-person attendance is not yet confirmed. Please do not book your travel or hotel accommodation yet.</p>
<p><strong> IMPORTANT DATES (all in 2021) </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Submission of contributed papers:  Monday 10 May</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acceptance/rejection notification:  Monday 7 June</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adjoint school:  Monday 5 July to Friday 9 July</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Main conference:  Monday 12 July to Friday 16 July</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> SUBMISSIONS </strong></p>
<p>The following two types of submissions are accepted:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Proceedings Track. Original contributions of high-quality work consisting of an extended abstract, up to 12 pages, that provides evidence of results of genuine interest, and with enough detail to allow the program committee to assess the merits of the work. Submission of work-in-progress is encouraged, but it must be more substantial than a research proposal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non-Proceedings Track. Descriptions of high-quality work submitted or published elsewhere will also be considered, provided the work is recent and relevant to the conference. The work may be of any length, but the program committee members may only look at the first 3 pages of the submission, so you should ensure that these pages contain sufficient evidence of the quality and rigour of your work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Papers in the two tracks will be reviewed against the same standards of quality. Since ACT is an interdisciplinary conference, we use two tracks to accommodate the publishing conventions of different disciplines. For example, those from a Computer Science background may prefer the Proceedings Track, while those from a Mathematics, Physics or other background may prefer the Non-Proceedings Track. However, authors from any background are free to choose the track that they prefer, and submissions may be moved from the Proceedings Track to the Non-Proceedings Track at any time at the request of the authors.</p>
<p>Contributions must be submitted in PDF format. Submissions to the Proceedings Track must be prepared with LaTeX, using the EPTCS style files available at <a href="http://style.eptcs.org">http://style.eptcs.org</a>.</p>
<p>The submission link will soon be available on the ACT2021 web page: <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/act2021">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/act2021</a></p>
<p><strong> PROGRAMME COMMITTEE </strong></p>

<h1>FINAL CALL FOR PAPERS</h1>
<h2>Fourth Annual International Conference on Applied Category Theory (ACT 2021)</h2>
<p>12 - 16 July, 2021, Cambridge, United Kingdom (and online)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/act2021">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/act2021</a></p>
<p>* * *
&lt;&lt;&lt; DEADLINE EXTENSION: Due to popular demand, the submission deadline has been extended to Wednesday 12 May. &gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;&lt; UPDATE: Our plans to run ACT 2021 as one of the first physical conferences post-lockdown are progressing well. Consider joining us in person in Cambridge! We also have financial support available for students and junior researchers. &gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>The Fourth International Conference on Applied Category Theory will take place at the Computer Laboratory of the University of Cambridge on 12-16 July, 2021, preceded by the Adjoint School 2021 on 5-9 July. This conference follows previous events at MIT, Oxford and Leiden.</p>
<p>Applied category theory is a topic of interest for a growing community of researchers, interested in studying many different kinds of systems using category-theoretic tools. These systems are found across computer science, mathematics, and physics, as well as in social science, linguistics, cognition, and neuroscience. The background and experience of our members is as varied as the systems being studied. The goal of the Applied Category Theory conference series is to bring researchers together, disseminate the latest results, and facilitate further development of the field.</p>
<p>We accept submissions of both original research papers, and work accepted/submitted/ published elsewhere. Accepted original research papers will be invited for publication in a proceedings volume. The keynote addresses will be drawn from the best accepted papers. The conference will include an industry showcase event.</p>
<p>We hope to run the conference as a hybrid event, with physical attendees present in Cambridge, and other participants taking part online. However, due to the state of the pandemic, the possibility of in-person attendance is not yet confirmed. Please do not book your travel or hotel accommodation yet.</p>
<p><strong> FINANCIAL SUPPORT </strong></p>
<p>We are able to offer financial support to PhD students and junior researchers. Full guidance is on the webpage.</p>
<p><strong> IMPORTANT DATES (all in 2021) </strong></p>
<p>- Submission Deadline: Wednesday 12 May (previously Monday 10 May)<br>
  - Author Notification: Monday 7 June<br>
  - Financial Support Application Deadline: Monday 7 June<br>
  - Financial Support Notification: Tuesday 8 June<br>
  - Priority Physical Registration Opens: Wednesday 9 June<br>
  - Ordinary Physical Registration Opens: Monday 13 June<br>
  - Reserved Accommodation Booking Deadline: Monday 13 June<br>
  - Adjoint School: Monday 5 to Friday 9 July<br>
  - Main Conference: Monday 12 to Friday 16 July</p>
<p><strong> SUBMISSIONS </strong></p>
<p>The following two types of submissions are accepted:</p>
<p>- Proceedings Track. Original contributions of high-quality work consisting of an extended summary, up to 12 pages excluding bibliography, that provides evidence of results of genuine interest, and with enough detail to allow the program committee to assess the merits of the work. Full proofs of mathematical statements are not necessarily required. Accepted submissions in this track will be invited for publication in a proceedings volume. Additional appendices beyond the page limit are permitted but may not be read by reviewers, and will not be included in the proceedings.</p>
<p>- Non-Proceedings Track. Submissions presenting high-quality work submitted or published elsewhere, or for which publication in the proceedings is not desired by the authors, may be submitted to this track, provided the work is recent and relevant to the conference. The work may be of any length, but the program committee members may only look at the first 3 pages of the submission, so you should ensure that these pages contain sufficient evidence of the quality and rigour of your work.</p>
<p>Papers in the two tracks will be reviewed against the same standards of quality. Since ACT is an interdisciplinary conference, we use two tracks to accommodate the publishing conventions of different disciplines. For example, those from a Computer Science background may prefer the Proceedings Track, while those from a Mathematics, Physics or other background may prefer the Non-Proceedings Track. However, authors from any background are free to choose the track that they prefer, and submissions may be moved from the Proceedings Track to the Non-Proceedings Track at any time at the request of the authors.</p>
<p>Contributions must be submitted in PDF format. Submissions to the Proceedings Track must be prepared with LaTeX, using the EPTCS style files available at &lt;<a href="http://style.eptcs.org">http://style.eptcs.org</a>&gt;.</p>
<p>The submission link will soon be available on the ACT2021 web page: &lt;<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/act2021">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/act2021</a>&gt;</p>

<p>By the way - a separate issue - a bunch of students at the ACT2021 "adjoint school" are going to the Topos Institute in July.

<p>I think that a zulip chat would have been a much better alternative. Especially if the zoom chat were disabled.</p>
<p>First of all, there would be an archive of the chat.</p>
<p>Second, the physical atendees would more easily be able to chat with the virtual atendees.</p>

<p>The latter part, I feel was the most lacking from this conference.  Why turn on zoom if you are attending physically?  On the other hand, as a physical attendee, I was already checking zulip, despite the fact that people were not talking about the talks at the conference.</p>

<p>There is also the minor barrier to entry here, that you need an invite link as part of the registration process for <em>this</em> zulip.  But that should be easily overcome by creating a conference-specific invite link.</p>
