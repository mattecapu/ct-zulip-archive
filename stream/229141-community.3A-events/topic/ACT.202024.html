<p>Another problem is if the author of a submission holds a lot of sway, a grad student may not want to publicly leave them a bad review. Especially if it is a person who has some level of control over their future.</p>

<p>Well, I am strongly in favor to attaching reviews to the paper before it gets into the proceeding. In this case, you would give a BIG incentive to reviewers to actually contribute and make the paper better, because the reviews become part of the paper.</p>

<p>The whole point is that you can be frank and direct without being a dick. And in a community of grown ups that should be the standard.</p>

<p>You can definitely judge that if someone gets three negative reviews from three people that work closely together (or are in the same group) and whose work is somewhat opposed/in competition with yours, then something may be improved.</p>

<p>In any case, I think that the whole concept of 'conference' in C.E. 2023 should probably be rethought a bit. But this is not the place for such a discussion, so if someone is interested, we can move on some other topic.</p>

<p>This would improve things also because reviews are not anonymous for people in the PC. So if a review gets a lot of criticism, people in the PC will hopefully take note.</p>

<p>There are some hypothetical concerns about open review that have been expressed here; why don't we "just" try a specific version of this option next time, and see how it goes? If these problems actually do arise, we can adapt and improve in the next iteration. It's worth noting that even this time there were enough submissions (and enough variety in the submissions) that I would find it very surprising if everyone was not able to avoid a conflict of interest in the papers they review.</p>

<p>I guess part of the question is: who is "we"?   There are a lot of people involved in running the ACT conference.  Only a small fraction are here on this Zulip.  Of them only a small fraction have expressed support for open review - maybe &lt; 5 people so far?  So reaching some sort of consensus that this is an experiment worth trying would take a lot of conversations.</p>

<p>Here is some <em>tentative</em> news, just to help people start thinking about the conference Applied Category Theory 2024.   It seems <em>possible</em> that this conference will be held at the University of Florida (in Gainesville) around the week of May 26, 2024, with the Adjoint School starting a week before, on May 19.</p>
<p>These details may change, so don't anything rash like booking your plane tickets until they are confirmed.</p>

<p>Here is the full call for papers: </p>
<p>7th Annual International Conference on Applied Category Theory (ACT2024)<br>
17 - 21 June 2024</p>
<p>Https://oxford24.Github.Io/</p>
<p>The Seventh International Conference on Applied Category Theory will take place at the University of Oxford from 17 - 21 June 2024, preceded by the Adjoint School 2024 from 10-14 July. This year, the ACT conference will be co-located with the 40th conference on Mathematical Foundations of Programming Semantics (MFPS). This conference follows previous events at University of Maryland College Park (MD), Strathclyde (UK), Cambridge (UK), Cambridge (MA), Oxford (UK) and Leiden (NL).</p>
<p>Call for Papers<br>
Applied category theory is important to a growing community of researchers who study computer science, logic, engineering, physics, biology, chemistry, social science, systems, linguistics and other subjects using category-theoretic tools. The background and experience of our members is as varied as the systems being studied. The goal of the applied category theory conference series is to bring researchers together, strengthen the applied category theory community, disseminate the latest results, and facilitate further development of the field.</p>
<p>Submissions<br>
We accept submissions in English of original research papers, talks about work accepted/submitted/published elsewhere, and demonstrations of relevant software. Accepted original research papers will be published in a proceedings volume. The conference will include an industry showcase event and community meeting. We particularly encourage people from underrepresented groups to submit their work and the organizers are committed to non-discrimination, equity, and inclusion.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>Conference papers should present original, high-quality work in the style of a computer science conference paper (up to 12 pages, not counting the bibliography; more detailed parts of proofs may be included in an appendix for the convenience of the reviewers). Such submissions should not be an abridged version of an existing journal article although pre-submission arxiv preprints are permitted. These submissions will be adjudicated for both a talk and publication in the conference proceedings.

Talk proposals not to be published in the proceedings or about work accepted/submitted/published elsewhere,should be submitted as abstracts, one or two pages long. Authors are encouraged to include links to any full versions of their papers, preprints or manuscripts. The purpose of the abstract is to provide a basis for determining the topics and quality of the anticipated presentation.

Software demonstration proposals should also be submitted as abstracts, one or two pages. The purpose of the abstract is to provide the program committee with enough information to assess the content of the demonstration.
</code></pre></div>

<p>The selected conference papers are expected to be published with EPTCS, and authors are advised to use the style files available at <a href="http://style.eptcs.org">style.eptcs.org</a>.</p>
<p>Submission, dates and deadlines:</p>
<p>The exact deadline time on these dates is given by anywhere on earth (AoE).<br>
Abstract registration by 26 March 2024<br>
Papers due 29 March 2024<br>
Author notification in 3 May 2024<br>
Conference 17 - 21 June 2024</p>
<p>(Reviewing will be single-blind, and we are not making public the reviews, reviewer names, the discussions nor the list of under-review submissions. This is the same as previous instances of ACT.)</p>
<p>Limited financial support will be available for travel. Priority will be given to people with financial need and those giving presentations. We are also aware that not everyone is able to travel to the UK, e.g. For visa reasons, and we will accommodate that in the programme via remote participation etc.. </p>
<p>Please contact the organizers for more information.</p>
<p>Program committee chairs:<br>

<p>I'd like to second the question here, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277446">@David Jaz</span>. I would also like to ask for clarification on what is meant by "Abstract registration by 26 March 2024". Is this an updated, earlier deadline for talk proposals? Or is this a deadline to pre-register a short abstract for any submissions, be they conference papers or talk proposals?</p>

<p>Hopefully this is the correct stream to post this question.<br>
I have submitted a paper to a data visualization conference in which I applied Category Theory in order to formalize some aspects of data viz (using categorical programming per defined by Dominic Orchard). In the process, I've also implemented a visualization package. Since the paper is for a data viz conference, I just sketched the categorical aspects. I was wondering if, for the ACT conference, it would be the case of writing another paper with an emphasis on the categorical aspects. Or if this would be "self-plagiarism", and if instead I should just submit the same paper I'm submitting to the other conference, but then adding some supplemental material.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>If the other conference publishes proceedings, then I think this is explicitly disallowed. Conferences typically require that papers have not been submitted for publication elsewhere at the same time. You can however submit an abstract for a non-proceedings talk, or a tool demo, but this has a limit of 2 pages, so you wouldn't be able to just submit the original paper.</p>
<p>If you want to write another paper on the categorical aspects, then as far as I understand, as long as you make it clear up-front which aspects belong to the other paper, and which are the novel contributions of the current paper, this is technically fine. It's another question however, as to whether the contents of the paper, minus all of the content that has already been submitted elsewhere, would be enough of a contribution to be suitable as a proceedings paper.</p>
<p>If the paper is going to be along the lines of "here is an algorithm which I have published elsewhere, but explained using more mathematical language", then I would probably suggest to instead submit for a non-proceedings talk or a tool demo. But if your paper could be more along the lines of "here are some mathematical ideas I developed while working on an algorithm, and here's are some theorems that justify or explain the algorithm", then maybe this would be more suitable for a full conference paper</p>

<p>Yes, that's clear from the <a href="https://oxford24.github.io/act_cfp.html">ACT2024 website</a>.  More precisely, ACT allows 3 kinds of submissions, and those where you are <em>trying to publish a paper in ACT2024</em> are disjoint from those where you've <em>submitted the paper elsewhere</em>.</p>

<p>We accept submissions in English of original research papers, talks about work accepted/submitted/published elsewhere, and demonstrations of relevant software.</p>

<p>In my culture, submitting the same paper at the same time for publication in several different venues has roughly the same moral status as proposing marriage to several different people at the same time.  What you're supposed to do is propose marriage to one person.  If they reject you, you are then free to propose to someone else.</p>

<p>Sorry, I realize my english got the best of me. What I meant by "submitting the same paper" was for the non-publishing track. The question was whether it would make sense, since the original paper didn't go into the detailed categorical construction.</p>

<p>As part of the ACT "steering committee", one of my jobs is to make sure the conference organizers remember to do the things that are on the list of things for conference organizers to do.  (Ugh, what an ugly sentence!)   Also to keep updating this list.   Each year we make this list available to the organizers, but each year the organizers forget some of the things they need to do.</p>

<p>Do the organizers know when the cost of the registration fee will be announced, or have a rough estimate?  I have to forecast the cost of my trip before I can send the form to administrators, and probably other people do as well.</p>

<p>With respect to the dinner, what does "delegate" mean? The ACT&amp;MFPS website says "This is an option for all delegates" while the registration page says "delegates only".

<p>I'm <em>really</em> kicking myself for being the one responsible for introducing registration fees to ACT 2 years ago. That was GBP 20 for everybody and we did it as a nudge because we needed to be confident how many people were coming because of the university's covid regulations at the time.

<p>I don't think people mind paying for their own coffee/tea/etc? That's what the student rate covers (£30-40), and indeed it's less than the Oxford 2019 fee. The rest is pretty complicated, please can we discuss it at the community meeting or in a separate thread?

The <a href="https://oxford24.github.io/act_cfp.html">ACT2024 website</a> is deficient this year since it doesn't even list the organizers, though at least now it lists the program committee.  This is fine if the organizers don't want to be known and don't want to be bothered, but for a <em>typical</em> conference it's easy to see who is running it.</p>

<p>Maybe, you could post a message: "Please put a <span aria-label="+1" class="emoji emoji-1f44d" role="img" title="+1">:+1:</span> under this message if you want the Zoom and Discord links and I'll send them to you in DM?"

<p>For fridge, I'm sorry, we don't have any special fridge capacity. We also don't really have space for eating lunch indoors in our building, today at least, unfortunately, but there is a nice big park opposite and it's getting warmer. <br>
If you have a special dietary issue or meds then we should be able to help with a fridge so let a local volunteer know. <br>
Similar for a printer, please just ask a local volunteer. <br>
