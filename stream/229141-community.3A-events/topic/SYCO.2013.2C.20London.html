<p>CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS<br>
THIRTEENTH SYMPOSIUM ON COMPOSITIONAL STRUCTURES (SYCO 13)</p>
<p>London, United Kingdom<br>
24-25 April, 2025</p>
<p>Submission deadline: Friday 7 March 2023<br>
<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/syco/13/">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/events/syco/13/</a></p>
<hr>
<p>The Symposium on Compositional Structures (SYCO) is an interdisciplinary series<br>
of meetings aiming to support the growing community of researchers interested in<br>
the phenomenon of compositionality, from both applied and abstract perspectives,<br>
and in particular where category theory serves as a unifying common<br>
language. Previous SYCO events have been held in Birmingham, Strathclyde,<br>
Oxford, Chapman, Leicester, Tallinn, and Como.</p>
<p>We welcome submissions from researchers across computer science, mathematics,<br>
physics, philosophy, and beyond, with the aim of fostering friendly discussion,<br>
disseminating new ideas, and spreading knowledge between fields. Submission is<br>
encouraged for both mature research and work in progress, and by both<br>
established academics and junior researchers, including students. Submissions is<br>
easy, with no formatting or page restrictions. The meeting does not have<br>
proceedings, so work can be submitted even if it has been submitted or published<br>
elsewhere. You could submit work-in-progress, or a recently completed paper, or<br>
even a PhD or Masters thesis.</p>
<p>While no list of topics could be exhaustive, SYCO welcomes submissions with a<br>
compositional focus related to any of the following areas, in particular from<br>
the perspective of category theory:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>logical methods in computer science, including classical and quantum<br>
   programming, type theory, concurrency, natural language processing and machine<br>
   learning;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>graphical calculi, including string diagrams, Petri nets and reaction<br>
   networks;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>languages and frameworks, including process algebras, proof nets, type theory<br>
   and game semantics;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>abstract algebra and pure category theory, including monoidal category theory,<br>
   higher category theory, operads, polygraphs, and relationships to homotopy<br>
   theory;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>quantum algebra, including quantum computation and representation theory;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>tools and techniques, including rewriting, formal proofs and proof assistants,<br>
   and game theory;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>industrial applications, including case studies and real-world problem<br>
   descriptions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES<br>
===============</p>
<p>All deadlines are 23:59 Anywhere on Earth.</p>
<p>Submission deadline: Friday 7 March, 2025<br>
Author notification: Wednesday 21 March, 2025<br>
Symposium dates: Thursday 24 and Friday 25 April 2025</p>
<p>SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS<br>
=======================</p>
<p>Submissions are on Easychair, via the SYCO 13 submission page:<br>
<a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=syco13">https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=syco13</a></p>
<p>Submission is easy, with no format requirements or page restrictions. The<br>
meeting does not have proceedings, so work can be submitted even if it has been<br>
submitted or published elsewhere. Think creatively: you could submit a recent<br>
paper, or notes on work in progress, or even a recent Masters or PhD thesis.</p>
<p>In the event that more good-quality submissions are received than can be<br>
accommodated in the timetable, the programme committee may choose to <em>defer</em><br>
some submissions to a future meeting, rather than reject them. Deferred<br>
submissions can be re-submitted to any future SYCO meeting, where they will not<br>
need peer review, and where they will be prioritised for inclusion in the<br>
programme. Meetings will be held sufficiently frequently to avoid a backlog of<br>
deferred papers.</p>
<p>If you have a submission which was deferred from a previous SYCO meeting, it<br>
will not automatically be considered for SYCO 13; you still need to submit it<br>
again through easychair. When submitting, append the words "DEFERRED FROM SYCO<br>
X" to the title of your paper, replacing "X" with the appropriate meeting<br>
number. There is no need to attach any documents.</p>
