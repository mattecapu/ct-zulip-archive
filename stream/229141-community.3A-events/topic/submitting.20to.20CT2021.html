<p>Hi people,<br>
I was wondering what are the submission guidelines/requirements for CT2021. On the website, it says the submissions should be 'extended abstracts', but I'm a newbie and that's not very clear to me.<br>
In particular, I suspect there are requirements on the length and exposition style of the 'paper'.<br>
Also, it that going to be the version published in the proceedings? I suspect not, which raises the question on the relationship between this submission and the later paper.</p>

<p>I don't see where it says "extended abstract". As far as I can see, it just says "abstracts of talks". You can see examples of such <a href="http://conferences.inf.ed.ac.uk/ct2019/all.pdf">abstracts for CT2019</a>.</p>

<p>In computer science, a talk is usually presented after a paper is submitted, so the work is finished (at least to the point of what is written in the paper). In mathematics, talks are frequently given before the work is finished.</p>

<p>Typically talks aren't "reviewed"; the conference organizers just choose talks they like.   The attitude is that publishing your proofs in a journal is what really matters; talks are basically just words that vanish into the air.</p>

<p>I think papers tend to get written faster in computer science. In contrast, in mathematics you’ll have a person give 5 or 6 talks on work they’re doing before a preprint even comes out.</p>

<p>Yeah, this. Most people in MSP and similar groups for example are mathematicians by thinking, but computer scientists by culture. (I never heard of the opposite combination, but I'd guess some Theory A focussed groups could be like that)</p>

<p>What happened is that submissions went up enormously.  We will deal with that by having a full schedule of live talks, and a schedule of pre-recorded talks that gets released earlier.  There also will be an industry session now.  I see no reason why anything has to change in atmosphere though.  The other upshot is that now there are serious sponsors, what also makes things easier for the organisers.</p>

<p>The number of submissions has definitely gone up drastically the last two years. In my view, the stuff that gets submitted is also increasingly mainstream quantum information type stuff. So I think it could happen that it becomes a more prestigious conference. But in any case, the last QPL to have taken place physically had a great atmosphere (and the Slack conversations of QPL2020 were also great)</p>

<p>I don't know about CT, I never attended, but when talking about "friendliness" we should rely on the feedback of the most fragile parts of our community: PhD students, people belonging to minorities, people that are a greater risk of being marginalized/treated badly for whatever reason. <br>
The appreciation for QPL is universal among these categories of attendees. On the contrary, I remember having heard of some people with a tenure track complaining, because in their opinion acceptance should have been stricter. That is understandable, sometimes inclusivity feels like less of a problem for people at the top of the academic pyramid. Which is exactly why I tend to rely on the opinions of those who are at its bottom on these matters. <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span></p>
