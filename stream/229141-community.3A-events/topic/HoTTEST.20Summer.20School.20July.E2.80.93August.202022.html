<p>We're delighted to announce the HoTTEST Summer School, which will take<br>
place online everywhere in the world during the months of July and<br>
August 2022.</p>
<p>The school will run both synchronously and asynchronously. The lectures<br>
will be delivered live (between 2:30-4pm UTC) and paired with various<br>
tutorial sessions run by teaching assistants. The course will also<br>
feature a discord-based all-hours Q&amp;A and an online archive of all<br>
course materials so that participants can follow along on their own<br>
schedule.</p>
<p>This school is for everyone and anyone with some familiarity with<br>
abstract mathematics or theoretical computer science and an itching to<br>
learn about homotopy type theory. Our goal is to make homotopy type<br>
theory accessible to, and inclusive of, everyone who is interested,<br>
regardless of cultural background, age, ability, formal education,<br>
ethnicity, gender identity, or expression. We believe HoTT is for<br>
everyone, and are committed to fostering a kind, inclusive environment.</p>
<p>The first part of the course will include parallel introductions to<br>
homotopy type theory and formalization given by Ulrik Buchholtz, Martín<br>
Hötzel Escardó, Dan Licata, Anders Mörtberg, Paige North, Emily Riehl,<br>
and Egbert Rijke. The summer school will then close with a series of<br>
colloquia introducing more advanced topics and exciting areas for<br>
further study delivered by Pierre Cagne, Favonia, Jonas Frey, Jon<br>
Sterling, and Chaitanya Leena Subramaniam.  A team of teaching<br>
assistants which includes Elisabeth Bonnevier, Tom de Jong, Jarl G.<br>
Taxerås Flaten, Artem Gureev, Perry Hart, Astra Kolomatskaia, Amélia<br>
Liao, Jacob Neumann, Johannes Schipp von Branitz, and Christopher<br>
Stough-Brown among others, will lead problem sessions and assist<br>
students with exercises.</p>
<p>A central aim of the summer school is to build community among all of<br>
the participants, irrespective of geography.  To further this, we will<br>
hold some online social events (e.g. game nights) for the summer school<br>
staff and participants.</p>
<p>More details about the course logistics and the scientific program will<br>
be announced soon on the summer school website:<br>

<p>In the meanwhile, we invite everyone to join us on the summer school<br>
Discord group to hang out and get to know one another:<br>

<p>If you would like to participate in some background surveys that will<br>
shape the design of the curriculum, please register for the Discord by<br>
May 15th, but students are also welcome to join in at any time.</p>
