<p><strong>Summer School on Formalizing Mathematics in Lean</strong></p>
<p>Director: Johan Commelin</p>
<p>Organisers: Christian Merten, Fernando Chu, Raphael Douglas Giles</p>
<p>We are pleased to announce a summer school on formalizing mathematics in Lean, which will take place at Utrecht University, Utrecht, the Netherlands, from <strong>21 July to 25 July 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Interactive theorem provers assist in the development of mathematical proofs by verifying and automating proof steps. Formalizing mathematics involves expressing mathematical arguments in a precise language that such systems can understand. In recent years, an increasing amount of mathematics, from undergraduate topics to cutting-edge research, has been formalized in various proof assistants.</p>
<p>This course will focus on Lean and its mathematical library, mathlib. Participants will learn how to formalize mathematical proofs and gain hands-on experience with Lean’s proof automation tools. This will enhance students' mathematical abilities and allow them to contribute to mathlib.</p>
<p>The course is aimed at students familiar with rigorous mathematical reasoning who have an interest in theorem proving. It is particularly suitable for those in the later stages of a bachelor’s degree or pursuing a master's or PhD in mathematics, computer science, physics, or related fields.</p>
<p>The participation fee for students is <strong>€200</strong>, which covers lunch and coffee breaks. If accommodation is required, this is also available for an additional fee.</p>
