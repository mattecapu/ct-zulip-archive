<p>This year I’m the faculty chair of the School of Computer and Cyber Sciences’ Colloquium Series. As many of you, I’ve had to transition this course online.

In addition, since there is no need for financial support, I’m also more free in who I ask to present.</p>
<p>So I am happy to announce that Paul-André Melliès will be our final presenter of the semester, but that’s not all! I have 100 seats available on my Zoom account, and only 30 of them will be needed for AU students and faculty. That leaves open 70 seats! So I am taking RSVPs from anyone who would like to attend the talk online.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Game semantics is the art of interpreting formulas (or types) as games and proofs (or programs) as strategies. In order to reflect the interactive behaviour of programs, strategies are required to follow specific scheduling policies. Typically, in the case of a sequential programming language, the program (Player) and its environment (Opponent) play one after the other, in a strictly alternating way. On the other hand, in the case of a concurrent language, Player and Opponent are allowed to play several moves in a row, in a non alternating way. In the two cases, the scheduling policy is designed very carefully in order to ensure that the strategies synchronise properly and compose well when plugged together. A longstanding conceptual problem has been to understand when and why a given scheduling policy works and is compositional in that sense. In this talk, I will introduce the notion of template game and exhibit a number of simple and fundamental combinatorial properties which ensure that a given scheduling policy defines (indeed) a monoidal closed bicategory of games, strategies and simulations. The notion of template game will be illustrated by constructing two game models of linear logic with different flavours (alternating and non alternating) using the same categorical combinatorics, performed in the category of small 2-categories.</p>

<p>But if he's not already planning to make this available afterwards on YouTube, he should!  It's so easy that there's no excuse not to do it (unless the speaker doesn't want it).
