<p>The Midlands Graduate School (MGS) provides an intensive programme of lectures on the Mathematical Foundations of Computing Science. It has run annually since 1999 and has been held at either the University of Birmingham, the University of Leicester, the University of Nottingham, or at the University of Sheffield. The lectures are aimed at postgraduate/PhD students, typically in their first or second year of study for a PhD. However, the school is open to anyone who is interested in learning more about mathematical computing foundations, and all such applicants are warmly welcomed. We very much encourage students from abroad to attend, participants from industry, and many have done so in the past.</p>
<p>Celebrating 25 Years, MGS 2024 will be held at the School of Computing and Mathematics, University of Leicester, U.K.</p>
