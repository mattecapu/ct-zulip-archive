<p>Announcement<br>
============</p>
<p>Twenty years after the publication of Ehrhard and Regnier’s first seminal paper<br>
on the subject [1], we are delighted to announce a conference on Differential<br>
λ-calculus and Differential Linear Logic [2], nicknamed DiλLL 2024.</p>
<p>[1] <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-3975(03)00392-X">https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-3975(03)00392-X</a> <br>
   [2] <a href="https://conferences.cirm-math.fr/2980.html">https://conferences.cirm-math.fr/2980.html</a></p>
<p>It will be held on 13--17 May 2024, at the CIRM in Luminy (Marseille, France), <br>
the campus where this fruitful line of work started twenty years ago.</p>
<p>The programme will consist in a series of invited talks, a good proportion of<br>
which will be tutorials, targeted at young researchers as well as<br>
non-specialists. It will also include surveys of the main advances obtained in<br>
the course of twenty years, as well as research talks on current topics.</p>
<p>For young researchers, it will also be possible to display posters in the<br>
premises of the conference during the whole week, in order to foster discussion<br>
around your work.</p>
<p>Registration<br>
============</p>
<p>Please register ASAP if you are interested in attending. The firm deadline<br>
for in person registration is <em>17 March 2024</em>, assuming the capacity of the <br>
CIRM is not reached by then.</p>
<p>Registration is done on the CIRM's website [3], which is also <br>
available on the conference page as "STEP 1 - PRE-REGISTER - APPLY HERE".</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>[3] https://www.cirm-math.fr/preRegistration/index.php?EX=login&amp;id_renc=2980
</code></pre></div>

<p>Note that if you do not know all the details of your participation yet, it is <br>
possible to register now, and modify your registration until the deadline.</p>
<p>If you have any questions regarding the event, feel free to email the<br>
organizers:  <a href="mailto:dill2024-org@listes.math.cnrs.fr">dill2024-org@listes.math.cnrs.fr</a> .</p>
<p>Participation is free, and we plan to fund the accommodation of all<br>
participants requiring it, as well as to provide a limited number of travel<br>
grants. See below.</p>
<p>Funding<br>
=======</p>
<p>We plan to fund the accommodation of any participant, within the limits of<br>
the capacity of the CIRM and of our budget. If you have funding available, <br>
allowing you to pay for your own accommodation, please let us know during<br>
registration: this will allow us to allocate more of our own funding to <br>
other participants.</p>
<p>The details of your accommodation will be managed by the CIRM.</p>
<p>We also plan to offer a limited number of travel grants, mainly targeted at<br>
young researchers (master or PhD students, postdocs): you can apply for such a<br>
grant in the registration form.</p>
<p>A first round of travel grants has been attributed, but further requests<br>
can still be considered.</p>
