<p>=================================================================</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>CaCS2021 is an event for research students (Honours/Masters/PhD) in<br>
category theory and related disciplines from around the world to meet each<br>
other and share their work. Everyone is welcome to attend the event. Each<br>
day will feature a 50 minute talk by an invited speaker and a series of 20<br>
minute contributed talks by research students, split across two sessions —<br>
the first aimed at Australasian and American time zones and the second at<br>
Australasian, African and European time zones. Attendees will also have the<br>
opportunity to meet and talk to each other in smaller groups at various<br>
times throughout the symposium.</p>
<p>This symposium is supported by MATRIX and AMSI. To support post-symposium<br>
research collaboration between PhD student participants, MATRIX and AMSI<br>
are providing funding through the MATRIX-AMSI PhD Student Research<br>
Collaboration Scheme. For more information, see<br>
<a href="https://www.matrix-inst.org.au/phd-student-research-collaboration-scheme-guidelines/">https://www.matrix-inst.org.au/phd-student-research-collaboration-scheme-guidelines/</a><br>
.</p>
<p>Please share the details of this event with research students in your local<br>
academic community.</p>
