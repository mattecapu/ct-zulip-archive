<p>A final CFP for MFPS 2024, with new information on invited speakers,<br>
special sessions and the pc. Submission deadline 29th March.<br>
MFPS XL: Mathematical Foundations of Programming Semantics<br>
Call for papers</p>
<p>The 40th Conference on the Mathematical Foundations of Programming<br>
Semantics (MFPS XL) takes place at the University of Oxford, UK, from<br>
19-21 June 2024, where it will be colocated with the 7th International<br>
Conference on Applied Category Theory (ACT 2024).</p>
<p>MFPS conferences are dedicated to the areas of mathematics, logic, and<br>
computer science that are related to models of computation in general,<br>
and to semantics of programming languages in particular. This is a forum<br>
where researchers in computer science and mathematics can meet and<br>
exchange ideas. The participation of researchers in neighbouring areas<br>
is strongly encouraged.</p>
<p>Topics include, but are not limited to, the following: bio-computation;<br>
concurrent qualitative and quantitative distributed systems; process<br>
calculi; probabilistic systems; constructive mathematics; domain theory<br>
and categorical models; formal languages; formal methods; game<br>
semantics; lambda calculus; programming-language theory; quantum<br>
computation; security; topological models; logic; type systems; type<br>
theory. We also welcome contributions that address applications of<br>
semantics to novel areas such as complex systems, markets, and networks,<br>
for example.</p>

SUBMISSION<br>
Important dates:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>March 29: paper submission
May 3: notification of authors
June 3: conference papers ready
June 19–21: conference
</code></pre></div>

<p>Submissions</p>
<p>Submissions should be prepared using the MFPS macros in the form of a PDF file.<br>
Submission is via EasyChair.</p>
<p>For the first time at MFPS, there are two submission categories:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>regular research contributions,

early announcements.
</code></pre></div>

<p>Early announcements are a new feature at MFPS XL. They offer a forum for<br>
the early presentation of new scientific contributions without the<br>
accompanying technical justification that is expected in a regular<br>
research contribution.</p>
<p>The page limit for both kinds of submission is 15 pages, excluding<br>
bibliography and appendices. However, it is expected that early<br>
announcements will typically be much shorter, taking only as many pages<br>
as is required to present the announced contribution. Early<br>
announcements will be refereed primarily on their potential<br>
interest-value to the MFPS audience. Early announcements should be<br>
identified by clearly labelling them with "Early Announcement" at the<br>
start of the pdf document.</p>
<p>Early announcements will be given equal presentation time to regular<br>
research contributions at the conference.<br>
Proceedings</p>
<p>A preliminary proceedings will be distributed at the meeting, containing<br>
both regular research contributions and early announcements.</p>
<p>Final proceedings, containing regular research contributions only, will<br>
be published in Electronic Notes in Theoretical Informatics and Computer<br>
Science (ENTICS <a href="https://entics.episciences.org/&lt;https://url.au.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/oU7rCNLJxkiKE019iV84Fx?domain=entics.episciences.org">https://entics.episciences.org/&lt;https://url.au.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/oU7rCNLJxkiKE019iV84Fx?domain=entics.episciences.org</a>&gt;). This open-access<br>
series is hosted by <a href="http://Episciences.org">Episciences.org</a> as an overlay for papers published<br>
by the CORR arXiv or HAL.</p>
<p>It is planned to publish a journal special issue for selected papers<br>
from MFPS XL.<br>
