<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>I am organizing a Summer School with considerable categorical content that I think will be of interest to many people in this forum. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276049">@David Spivak</span>, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="280755">@Owen Lynch</span>, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="281326">@Ryan Wisnesky</span> , <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="402770">@Jonathan Gorard</span> and myself will be giving talks and courses on category theory or adjacent topics. Here is the announcement, please feel free to share in your networks and relevant mailing lists:</p>
<p>Interdisciplinary Summer School 2023 in Valencia (Spain) 24-28 July</p>
<p>This summer… learn about physics, evolutionary biology, computation, philosophy of science, literature and mathematics… enjoy beach parties, art jam sessions, mind-bending debates, local cuisine and nightlife. All of this, and more, in the scenic city of Valencia, situated on the Mediterranean coast of Spain.</p>
<p><a href="https://semf.org.es/school2023/">https://semf.org.es/school2023/</a></p>
<p>Places are limited, be sure to follow the link above and register to secure your spot early. Participants in the SEMF Summer School travelling to Valencia get access to sponsored accommodation at a reduced price and in an excellent location, minutes away from the School venue, and within walking distance of the beach and the city centre.</p>
<p>The aim of this event is to gather a group of young researchers, creators and students that engage in a very unique intellectual environment while attending talks and short courses by leading figures. Here is a handful of speakers and topics covered:</p>
<p>Michael Levin (Tufts University) - Evolution, Basal Cognition and Regenerative Medicine<br>
David Spivak (MIT) - Category Theory Applied to Scientific Interdisciplinarity<br>
Milena Ivanova (University of Cambridge) - Aesthetics of Science<br>
Stephen Wolfram (Wolfram Research) - Computational 2nd Law of Thermodynamics<br>
Irida Altman (ETH Zurich) - Literary Aspects of Mathematics</p>
<p>We encourage participants to attend in person but remote online attendance is also possible, you can choose your modality when registering in the link above.</p>
<p>We look forward to welcoming you in Valencia or online soon!</p>
<p>The SEMF team</p>

<p>Yeah, that's very much our approach! This is the first time we have been able to put this together and have an international audience since covid. We are excited to see how the first edition goes. Next year there will be longer notice!</p>

<p>I'm very interested in the intersection between math and neuroscience, so this school is a very intriguing opportunity to me. But Spain is rather far, so I'm wondering if people who have more experience than I do going to these sorts of events might be able to supply some knowledge. How much of an opportunity is there usually to talk individually with the speakers? How many of the listed speakers tend to show up? Is the primary purpose of this school to learn about the various topics, or does networking also play a substantial role? Are there any reasons why someone should or should not go to an event like this that might be obvious to someone who has been to several but not to someone who hasn't?</p>

<p>This event is both a learning experience where you can hear talks from leading figures in many disciplines alongside minicourses taught by young researchers and a unique networking opportunity (particularly for junior researchers and young people). As the organizer myself and having run some past editions, I can say that both online and in-person participation have those two aspects to a significant degree. I would say you should consider coming in person if you align with the overall values and "vibe" of our society SEMF. You can see that from our website:</p>

<p>Sounds amazing! Unfortunately I saw it too late (just today) and registration is closed. Is registration required for online attendance (the livestreams and other online material)?</p>

<p>Can't believe I missed this. I should really turn on zulip notifications. Hope you all have an amazing time!</p>
