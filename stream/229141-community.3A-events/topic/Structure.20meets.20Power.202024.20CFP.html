<p>Aim<br>
——-</p>
<p>There is a remarkable divide in the field of logic in Computer Science between two distinct strands: one focuses on semantics and compositionality (“Structure”), the other on expressiveness and complexity (“Power”). These two traditions are studied by almost disjoint research communities using distinct technical languages and methods. We believe that bringing these communities and research fields together is an important objective in Computer Science, which may hold the key to fundamental advances in the field. The aim of this workshop is to attract investigators at the boundary of the two strands, and those on either side of the divide interested in establishing new connections.</p>
<p>Previous workshops on this theme were held as affiliated workshops of LiCS 2021, ICALP 2022 and LiCS 2023. This is a LiCS/ICALP 2024 affiliated workshop. It will be a hybrid event, however on-site participation is highly encouraged.</p>
