<p>I don't think it was separately announced on the Zulip, but you may be aware that these conferences are happening in Tallinn this year; see the announcement <a href="#narrow/stream/410322-community.3A-mailing-list-mirror/topic/ICALP-LICS-FSCD.20joint.20call.20for.20workshops/near/401025313">here</a>.</p>
<p>Having co-authored two submitted papers, I have just started looking into registration for the conference, and was shocked to see that attendance to either of the smaller conferences will cost an eye-watering 640 euros (and go up to 770 if one waits until May); ICALP attendance costs 800 (resp. 960) and there is a reduced combined fee of 1000 (resp. 1200) if one wishes to attend all three - but even that doesn't include the workshops or the conference dinner!<br>
Since the majority of the organisers are here, I might as well ask: <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="319936">@Niccolò Veltri</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276363">@Amar Hadzihasanovic</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="282822">@fosco</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277812">@Matt Earnshaw</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="636946">@Diana Kessler</span> why is this so expensive?</p>
<p>The closest comparison available is that last year's ICALP cost 640 (resp. 740), so that's an increase of 25% (resp. 30%) on last year, and the previous year it was only 540 (resp. 640) so an increase of 48% (resp. 50%) over two years ago!</p>
<p>Moreover, this is organised on a university campus by people working at that campus, yet attendance at ICALP costs more than attendance at (to pick an example that is essentially random but that I know about for family reasons) the <a href="https://www.egu24.eu/attend/register.html">European Geosciences Union General Assembly</a>, which is hosted at an external conference center in Vienna. Last year that had <a href="https://www.egu23.eu/">over 18000 attendees</a>, to give you an idea of the size, which is far more than attended ICALP, according to <a href="https://icalp2023.cs.upb.de/gallery/">the gallery</a> rather than official figures... So what's the story?</p>

<p>While I'm on board with the sentiment here, and believe more generally that the conference system in computer science is terminally ill and ought to be euthanized , I can point to one extenuating cicrumstance.</p>
<p>I also currently work at Taltech, and our university is not a suitable conference venue. I think the organizers have had to rent rooms elsewhere in the city. If I recall some of them are at "Tallinn University", but it is important to note that this is a different university!</p>

The organisers are able to find a bunch of excuses for why the costs are higher relative to previous years, but there is no transparency about the breakdown of costs.</p>

<p>Also if anyone fancies hosting any of these conferences, please do contact the steering committee chair of the conference, especially if you have a way of doing it cheaply (or even if not). My impression is that SC chairs are always very pleased to hear of willing hosts, and it often seems a bit of a struggle to find a host.</p>

<p>So ACM take 17% on every conference and haven't gone to the effort of getting recognized as a charity in the UK and Europe, that's already annoying.<br>
Do the provided figures apply only to the 3-day main conference, or the full 7 days including satellite events? If it's the former, the prices are still pretty hard to stomach.</p>

<p>Even if on average each of the 779 in-person attendees was present for five days, that's over 72£/person/day on food and drinks after tax for one meal and coffee breaks. That's not a cost I find acceptable.</p>

<p>Ah apparently IET AV is a contractor that does video recording at live events. According to the programme there were seven rooms where talks took place, so that's just over 600GBP/room/day. The talks were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyrlk8Xaylp6IHv6D4SyE6ZO3xGp_lvBk">live streamed</a> so this comprimes a person switching between screen templates at appropriate times (although that job might have been done by a volunteer), renting the equipment and having technical support on hand.<br>
That's a relatively small contribution to the cost at a little over 5GBP/attendee (including remote attendance), but it's pretty hard to judge if even that is good value.</p>

<p>Hi Morgan -- there's no big mystery, we did our sums and that's what it costs to organise such a big, complex event in Tallinn.  Since covid and the war in Ukraine there has been a lot of inflation in this part of the world.</p>
<p>For ICALP specifically the price rise over last year is due to the fact that this year ICALP is a five day event instead of the usual four.</p>
