<ul>
<li>A unified framework for equivalences in social networks</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the main concerns in network science is the study of social positions and roles. By "position" social scientists usually mean a collection of actors who have similar ties to other actors, while a "role" is a specific pattern of ties among actors or positions. Since the 1970s a lot of research has been done to develop these concepts in a rigorous way. An open question in the field is whether it is possible to perform role and positional analysis simultaneously. In joint work with Mason Porter we explore this question by proposing an approach motivated by ideas of a category-theoretic nature. In this talk I will introduce role and positional analysis, present some well-studied examples from social network science, and what new insights this approach might gives us.</p>

<p>We're planning to change the format of Nina's talk.  She writes, in part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many shops on the street in which my apartment is in Downtown LA have been looted, and looters even broke into the first floor of my building, but luckily my neighbors were able to put out the fire and get them out. I am in Europe, but my neighbors write to me that it almost feels like being in a war in Downtown LA, and at the moment I am very worried about everyone in the US. I deeply wish I was there to help protesters or small non-profits in need, or help clean up my neighborhood. </p>
<p>I am writing to you because in the current circumstances I do feel that it would not be right to go on with business as usual and give my talk on Wednesday. Instead I would like to suggest to do the following. We have a problem with lack of diversity in the category theory community, both in demographic as well as geographic terms. The current pandemic, and the fact that all activities are now taking place remotely, gives us the opportunity to involve  people from geographically distant areas, or people who would otherwise find it difficult to travel, even within the US. Thus, I would like to use the slot allocated for my talk on Wednesday to have a discussion on what concrete steps we can take now to make our community more diverse, and give opportunities to students and researchers from underprivileged backgrounds.</p>

<p>Awesome :). It has been quite startling for me having attended quite a few conferences without seeing a single black person in it (I do realize that there are more under-presented minorities but the lack of black people has been egregious and blatant while, for instance, sexism in academia is at least addressed to some extent). It is great to see senior academics willing to discuss and do something about it.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> Saddened by the current events, we are taking this opportunity to pause and reflect on what we can do to change the status quo and try to bring about real and long-lasting change. Thus, we are holding a discussion aimed at finding concrete solutions to make the Applied Category Theory community more inclusive, and also to reflect about the values that our community would like to stand for and endorse, in particular, in terms of which sources of funding go against our values. While this discussion is specific to the applied category theory community, we believe that many of the topics will be of interest also to people in other fields, and thus we welcome anybody with an interest to attend. The discussion will consist of two parts: we will have first several people give short talks to discuss common issues that we need to address, as well as present specific plans for initiatives that we could take. We believe that the current pandemic, and the fact that all activities are now taking place remotely, gives us the opportunity to involve people who would otherwise find it difficult to travel, because of disabilities, financial reasons or care-taking responsibilities. Thus, now we have the opportunity to come up with new types of mentoring, collaborations, and many other initiatives that might have been difficult to envision until just a couple of months ago. The second part of the discussion will take place on the category theory community server, and its purpose is to allow for a broader participation in the discussion, and ideally during this part we will be able to flesh out in detail the specific initiatives that have been proposed in the talks.</p>

<p>I can't join the call today, but I will leave my 50c here speaking as an organiser of the 2nd ACT school last year. (Nina and Brendan were organisers of the 1st one). I think that's a role that has a lot of responsibility here, as an entry point to our community. Overall we could have done worse, but also a lot better. The biggest issue I was thinking about at the time was the extreme lack of geographic diversity: despite being a mostly-online thing, I think everybody selected was based in western Europe, Canada, USA or Australia. Two reasons for that. Stupid reason is we had an effective budget of zero and we just couldn't select anyone who couldn't guarantee funding from their institution to travel to Oxford. More interesting reason is that in practice, a strong letter of recommendation from someone we trust outweighed basically every other factor. And no surprises for guessing where those people are based</p>

<p>Here's 50 cent more from one of this year's organizer. This year's school isn't perfect. However, also thanks to what previous organizers told us (Jules, Daniel Cicala, Brendan Fong and Nina Otter), we tried to make the school more accessible, trying to address the issues that Jules rightfully pointed out. In particular, we gave less weight to who wrote the recommendation letters (provided they were serious people).<br>
But mostly, we had the luck of finding a big "accessibility" sponsor, Protocol Labs, who gave us funding to help people fly to Boston from everywhere in the world. <br>
Our luck seems to have ended there: about 5 minutes after finding such funding, Corona came...</p>

<p>Zoom demanded a software upgrade before I could join the meeting. This, of course, prompted a wave of petty irritation on my part — why can’t people get <em>supposedly critical infrastructure software</em> correct on the first go? — which I am riding into a more serious concern about the entire academic world centralizing upon a single mediocre product. Surely “monoculture is bad” and “flexibility is key to resilience” are lessons we’re smart enough to take to heart…</p>
<p>I'm not particularly evangelical on the subject of free/open-source/what-have-you software, but I do have a bad feeling about this.</p>

<p>And I was avoiding conference travel, which I found both psychologically deleterious and ecologically unjustifiable, probably to the detriment of my own career. So, the community's "pivot to video" has given me just a bit of the unpleasant sensation that I grabbed the monkey's paw.</p>

<p>We're past the point in time where we need quick solutions that "just work" immediately "out of the box". Now the spring term is done, and we're not trying to find a way to give tomorrow's seminar or hold next week's office hours. Instead, we're seeking options for annual conferences and the fall semester. This is an opportunity to double-check the choices we've made so far and examine which of them might have been made differently under less time pressure.</p>
<p>There may not be a <em>direct</em> link between selecting a particular software package and the cause of minority representation in science, but as the saying goes, "the standard you walk past is the standard you accept".

<p>I can't join the call today, but I will leave my 50c here speaking as an organiser of the 2nd ACT school last year. (Nina and Brendan were organisers of the 1st one). I think that's a role that has a lot of responsibility here, as an entry point to our community. Overall we could have done worse, but also a lot better. The biggest issue I was thinking about at the time was the extreme lack of geographic diversity: despite being a mostly-online thing, I think everybody selected was based in western Europe, Canada, USA or Australia. Two reasons for that. Stupid reason is we had an effective budget of zero and we just couldn't select anyone who couldn't guarantee funding from their institution to travel to Oxford. More interesting reason is that in practice, a strong letter of recommendation from someone we trust outweighed basically every other factor. And no surprises for guessing where those people are based</p>

<p>In general, however, I think Jules' comment, and also Jade's talk, are pointing out a big, uncomfortable truth of academia: very often, reinforcement of the status quo comes disguised as "meritocracy". Or better, <em>proxies</em> to meritocracy. For example, coming from a famous institution.</p>

<p>Agreed. Zoom has started as the "emergency solution", and right now, with all the conferences coming, not many have time to try out, learn, and accept other technologies (yet), but you are 100% right. As one of the "media persons" in the ACT community, I'd be very happy to look for other solutions (even open source) in the longer term, after these summer conferences. I have already a couple of ideas in mind, and any additional idea is welcome. <br>
By the way, I've tried Jitsi. It doesn't have the quality and features of Zoom, but it's solid and reliable. <br>

<p>In terms of being a "more welcoming" or at least "less intimidating" place for newcomers (which is important in increasing the scope and diversity of people involved) I would suggest people consider adopting some variant of the recurse center's social rules, either on the zulip, or also perhaps at ACT conferences, etc. as well <a href="https://www.recurse.com/social-rules">https://www.recurse.com/social-rules</a></p>
<ul>
<li>No well-actually’s</li>
<li>No feigned surprise</li>
<li>No backseat driving</li>
<li>No subtle -isms</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>For this to work, it's important that there be firm moderation to make sure such social rules are being followed. Some of my experiences here, in this Zulip chat, have been some of my worst online experiences in terms of feeling talked at, talked down to, and disrespected at a basic level. In such cases, there needs to be a moderator one can reach to get things sorted out.</p>

<p>a lot of "governance" is not actually using moderation tools or the threat, which is heavy-handed. it is people with certain authority more proactively asking people to chill, or reminding them when they may be inadvertently making people feel small (i.e. well-actuallying) and encouraging them to present their points in a more positive way.</p>

<p>As a MathOverflow moderator, I can say that publicly asking people to "chill" or reprimanding them in any way often requires a great deal of tact, for example avoiding situations where someone feels ganged up on. Having a private word can often work better (and sometimes even that can be touchy).</p>

<p>I agree, but I'd also point out that doing things publicly (but with a massively light touch) also encourages others.</p>
