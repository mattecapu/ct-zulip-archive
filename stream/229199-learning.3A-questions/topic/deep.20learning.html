<p>Because I love math and the abstractions of CT look really interesting. Second because I'm working on Deep Learning and I feel like a lot of stuff could benefit at least from categorical inspirations (compositionality is pretty much one of the assumptions of Deep Learning). Finally I feel like compositionality is a powerful idea in general, showing up in things like shell, Lisps. JAX and Julia</p>

<p>If you love math and are interested in category theory in its own right, you should look at something which is about pure category theory.  I really like these notes: <a href="https://home.gwu.edu/~wschmitt/papers/cat.pdf">https://home.gwu.edu/~wschmitt/papers/cat.pdf</a>  After working through these notes, I used Emily Riehl's book, which has a lot of examples from different fields of math --- if you don't know those fields, you won't get all the examples, but you can just skip the examples you don't get.  I've also heard other computer science people say they liked Awodey's book, though I have not looked at it much personally.  "Algebra Chapter 0" and "Topology: A Categorical Approach" would be great if you want to learn algebra and topology, do you want to learn these things?</p>

<p>They are among the things I want to learn. I've always been fascinated by Algebra and tried to take it when I began college, but Brazil's curricula are very strict and I only maanaged to audit the class. And topology also looks cool and useful for DL</p>

<p>Hi Joao! Unfortunately ACT for Deep Learning is a relatively niche field, and I'm not sure if there's any introductory texts focused on understanding CT with examples from Deep learning. <br>
If what you're looking for is papers, then you're sort of in luck, because there's a few. I compiled a list a while ago <a href="https://github.com/bgavran/Category_Theory_Machine_Learning">https://github.com/bgavran/Category_Theory_Machine_Learning</a>  but most of these are probably pretty abstract if you're just getting into this. Nonetheless, as Jules says - it's good to read those and see what kind of things people are doing, even if its just getting a taste.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, there's been a new paper on arxiv today (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01189">https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01189</a>) about learners, and actually we should have our paper on Categorical Foundations of Gradient-Based Learning up on arxiv very very soon :)</p>

<p>If you follow machine learning in the same direction as us (which I <em>think</em> is the "canonical" way of taking seriously the existing compositionality of deep learning - but being wrong is always an option, there could be some totally different way you could go) - you'll eventually meet the question "what the heck does game theory have to do with anything"</p>

<p>As an outsider to ML, I don't have a good answer for exactly how it should connect.  But there has to be more than a superficial connection between learning goals and player goals, learning strategies and game theoretic strategies, etc.  Any kind of learning system/environment should at least be expressible as a formal game, and from there, game theory ought to at least offer some insights.  Same should apply to human learning, as well.</p>

<p>By the way, just because something is a basic observation doesn't necessarily mean it's an easy observation to make, especially for the first time.  E.g. it's a basic observation that the number zero is important to mathematics.</p>

<p>I think the intuitive answer is that game theory studies distributed decision making and that intelligence rarely (if ever) emerges from individual decision making as opposed to distributed decision making</p>

<p>This is all true, but the connection been categorical approach to machine learning and game theory is more subtle than that. They're structurally the same. I think the true answer is actually closer to "game theory is a kind of machine learning" than the other way round - the central idea of compositional game theory turned out in retrospect to be a sort of "backpropagation of payoffs". In Strathclyde we're working towards a proper grand unification, but none of it's written down yet...</p>

<p>It really depends on how you define stuff. I'm quite eager to make game and learners the same thing, since their categorical semantics is so similar. One key difference is in the computation of equilibria/learning process, but they can be put on the same footing as well (by swapping a gadget attached to them)<br>

<p>If you take the definitions exactly as given in Backprop As Functor and Compositional Game Theory then in a completely literal sense you get a functor from learners to games (I wrote the construction in this short tech report: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08666">https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08666</a>), and I think not the other way. But in private we've been fiddling with the definitions of both so they are both subsumed under a single definition, since we had a gut feeling that it was a good idea. Mostly this involves making learners look more like games. In particular, almost all of the differences between the 2 papers arise from the fact that they're not talking about the differentiable structure that's in machine learning, they stick to Set (which in turn buys them some more generality to talk about other kinds of learners that don't use differentiation). Once you put the differentiable structure back into Backprop As Functor it <em>really</em> starts to look the same as open games - not that there's an adjunction or even an equivalence, but that they're literally the same category</p>
