<p>I have some questions on Joyal's fascinating talk that is just wrapping up.</p>
<ol>
<li>J said that coherence spaces are related to bicompletions. What precisely is that relationship? Are they a bicompletion? To me it sounds like the Sum-product-bicompletion is much bigger than coherence spaces?</li>
<li>What's the reference for the statement that bicompletions of *-autonomous categories are *-autonomous?</li>
</ol>

<p>It's not that kind of reference (the statement is asserted in Joyal's papers); however it is the kind of reference that contains no proofs, and we just learnt from Joyal's talk that he didn't even prove for himself everything he asserted in that paper.</p>

<p>Anyway, this reminds me of Barwick's <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/files/BarwickFutureOfHomotopyTheory.pdf">the future of homotopy theory</a> where he writes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We do not have a good culture of problems and conjectures. The people at the top of our field do not, as a rule, issue problems or programs of conjectures that shape our subject for years to come. In fact, in many cases, they simply announce results with only an outline of proof – and never generate a complete proof. Then, when others work to develop proofs, they are not said to have solved a problem of So-and-So; rather, they have completed the write-up of So-and-So’s proof or given a new proof of So-and-So’s theorem. The ossification of a caste system – in which one group has the general ideas and vision while another toils to realize that vision – is no way for the subject to flourish. Other subjects have high-status visionaries  who are no sketchier in details than those in homotopy theory, but whose unproved insights are nevertheless known as conjectures, problems, and programs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(that's what I had in the back of my mind when writing the above comment)</p>

<p>I think the nLab is dealing with attrbutions correctly (now, at least) when it says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The above references do not contain proofs. For a sketch of the existence of free bicompletions of categories, see <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1686774/can-we-simultaneously-freely-adjoin-both-limits-and-colimits-to-a-category">this MathOverflow question</a>.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we're in the sad situation where nobody can now publish a proof of this result because everyone thinks of it as Joyal's result, it would be good if interested people take Zhen Lin's argument on MathOverflow and complete it (or bicomplete it!) to obtain a proof, and then put that on the nLab.</p>

I think that’s the main part that’s not “routine” adjoint functor theorem business. I wonder whether it’s clear to anybody here why those functors are ff?</p>

<p>In case it wasn't clear or you didn't see my wording, it wasn't like a casual comment over dinner. It was stated in his conference talk at CT '95 in Halifax before a packed house. (I mentioned it hoping that it would jog his memory a little.)</p>

<p>For Set monads, there is some remote chance that the coproduct of monads whose unit is a mono will have monomorphic unit "by construction". Here I have in mind the paper "Coproducts of Monads on Set" by Adamek et al. If this is any true, I am quite sure it would be using the following facts: coprojections are monos in Set, and that colimits of chains of monos are monos, the monads map monos to monos.</p>

<p>I was wondering whether full faithfulness of the unit could be deduced from full faithfulness of the embedding into the completion and cocompletion. It would certainly be satisfying if many of the formal properties of the bicompletion could be deduced from the fact it is a coproduct of pseudomonads.</p>

<p>I am sure he means it in earnest when he says it is not meant to be arrogant. In spite of this good faith I have a hard time taking seriously the idea that homotopy theory is not a part of algebraic topology. To me this seems like trying to jettison the old-fashioned and historical - algebraic topology, ho-hum, how ancient and boring - in favor of the modern and exciting, higher categorical concepts. Algebraic topology is ancient stuff like Kan complexes (1958 - dinosaurs!) Homotopy theory is about modern concepts like infinity groupoids (Lurie, 2009 - cutting edge!) These two are obviously completely unrelated.</p>

<p>I'd say a certain chunk of traditional algebraic topology is the study of what homotopy types and maps between them <em>are like</em>: we study invariants of them, try to classify them, etc.    The new work is more about <em>what we can do</em> with homotopy types and maps between them: how we can set up math using these  rather than sets as the fundamental structures, and what are the interesting features of this new kind of math.</p>

<p>But I believe it's inevitable that the old work will inform the new work.   When you start serious work using any sort of mathematical material - be it sets, groups, homotopy types or whatever - you eventually start wanting to know detailed facts about what those things <em>are like</em>.</p>

<p>Nonetheless we are right now experiencing an immense growth phase in doing new math with homotopy types.  This field is so immature that - right now - one can do a lot of interesting new things with homotopy types without relying much on the detailed wisdom algebraic topologists have about what homotopy types and maps between them <em>are like</em>.</p>
