<p>Hi folks!</p>
<p>I came across the <a href="https://adjointschool.com/">Adjoint School</a> about a month ago or so and was hoping to get some input from the community on a few questions I had! Here they are:</p>
<ol>
<li>What makes a successful application to the adjoint school? I have heard it is quite competitive and want to start thinking ahead about how best to prepare.</li>
<li>I heard and read that potential applicants could come forward with their own ideas of a topic/project to pursue. What would be the best way to present and polish up those ideas?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks folks and I am happy to add clarification as needed! Hoping this could also help with answering questions other potential applicants may have! </p>
<p>(Also, cc <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span> from an earlier conversation)</p>

<p>When you actually work with someone at the Adjoint School you will <em>not</em> be working on an arbitrary topic of your own devising: there will be a small set of mentors, each with a topic, and you'll choose one and work with them on a project in that topic.  You'll have some ability to craft the details of that project, but it works best if you follow the lead of the mentor and work on the subject they're interested in.</p>

<p>As for what makes a successful application, I guess the best thing is to demonstrate that you know stuff about applied category theory and - even better! - have <em>done</em> stuff in applied category theory... especially in the specific topic that one of the mentors has proposed as a research project.</p>
<p>(By the time you apply you'll know who the mentors are, and what their proposed topics are.)</p>

<p>But: there are a lot of people here who have either been mentors at the Adjoint School, or have been students at this school, or <em>both</em> - as well as people who have applied and not gotten in.   All of these people probably have interesting things to say about your question!  So I hope they speak up!</p>

<p>For what it's worth, here are my answers to the "important" questions of last year's application (which was accepted). Note that I was very lucky there was a project led by Fillipo Bonchi with whom I already wanted to work.<br>

<p>Thanks, Ralph! This sort of thing could be very helpful to would-be students - not to "game the system", but to get a better sense of what applying to the Adjoint School is really like.</p>

<p>I'll say the pessimistic bit: back when I was an organiser in 2019 we had to reject something like 4/5 of applicants, most of who had strong applications and could probably have done well in the school</p>

<p>Pessimistic, but it should make folks feel better if they get rejected: it doesn't mean you're bad!</p>
