<p>I'm getting tired of writing long boring proofs of things that are obvious (e.g. show that an object satisfies a universal property, show that two bicategories are equivalent, show that a functor is monoidal).  Will a proof assistant help my situation, or will it take even longer?  If it will help, which one do you recommend?</p>

<p>Subject: Proof assistant for tedious CT computations</p>
<p>Hi Professor Kreitz,</p>
<p>I am a math PhD student at Indiana University, and I am having to do a lot of tedious category theory computations in my work.  I was looking for a proof assistant that would save me some time, and I found your paper "Automating Proofs in Category Theory" and your chapter "Nuprl as Logical Framework for Automating Proofs in Category Theory", which seem to be just the kind of thing that I am looking for.  So I am wondering, is it a good idea to use Nuprl for this kind of thing, or is there another proof assistant out now that would be better for this purpose (MetaPRL, RedPRL, Coq?)  Thanks for any advice you can give,</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Joshua</p>

<p>Are you ignoring more popular proof assistants because you don't think they'll be particularly useful for category theory? I know Lean has some CT in its standard library (and I'd be surprised if others didn't as well) but maybe that's not enough for your purposes</p>

<p>Proof assistants can be very useful as a library for finding out what terms mean. For example <a href="https://github.com/agda/agda-categories">Agda Categories</a> can be thought of as a huge executable library, that explains what terms mean by showing how they are implemented. It would be great to have a Cubical HoTT version. I think as they make progress they will be very useful to look up definitions. And also one learns by doing.</p>

<p>No, the only reason I'm thinking about Nuprl is that I saw those papers about doing exactly what I want to do with Nuprl.  Do you think that it is possible to do the same sort of thing in more popular proof assistants?  I really don't know much about proof assistants, so I don't know how similar or different they are.</p>

<p>Usually, formalizing a proof in a proof assistant is considerably harder than working on paper.</p>

<p>What you gain is that if it typechecks you can be certain of your proof. But no, it will not make it less tedious. On the contrary, it will make it way more tedious, and you will have to spend a great deal of time to convince your compiler that some thing that you consider totally obvious is true</p>

<p>Also, while working with proof assistants the way you formalize things in the beginning makes a great deal of difference. For instance, at Statebox we decided to formalize categories as strict (associativity and identities are equalities, not isos) and this has been a dramatically bad choice. It turns out that, at least while using dependent type theory, non-strict definitions are much more manageble.</p>

<p>This will, presumably, force you to go back and forth many times to completely rewrite your definitions in a way that makes sense. Obviously you will find out that what you thought would make sense does not only after hours/weeks/months that you have worked on it.</p>

<p>So, long story short: Formalizing proofs with computers is unbelievably cool and interesting for a lot of reasons, and you should definitely give it a try. But if your goal is to "get rid of the verboseness and save time" this is really, really, really the wrong choice xD</p>

<p>There are in principle a lot of powerful tricks for category theory that would be facilitated by verified automation. But at least at the moment, as far as I've seen, these tend to be a little heavy to deploy, and may require learning a bit of programming language theory.</p>

<p>I should be clear on what exactly I want to avoid.  I want to avoid having to spend lots of time on stuff that is easy (and thus boring).  If there is a way to spend about the same amount of time to get to the same place, or even a bit more (due to a learning curve), but have it be challenging, I would greatly prefer that.</p>

<p>For example, if instead of cranking out proofs where I right down the obvious thing and it works, I'd rather go up one metalevel and think about strategies for coming up with "the obvious thing"</p>

<p>Also, I really like Lambek's approach of thinking of categorical structures syntactically (a language of objects, a language of arrows, a language of equalities between arrows), so I think what a proof assistant would expect would align with the way I already think about CT anyway</p>

<p>This sort of thing you can definitely do, and if you're wanting to learn something, then algebraic solvers are full of nice theory, and worth doing as an exercise.

<p>Yes, that's important.   There are lots of ways to do that.   With category theory I often explore topics by thinking about them in words using general principles.   When two principles seem to conflict, or the principles I know don't seem powerful enough to guess any answer to some question, then sometimes I calculate.   At that point it's often not tedious, because I'm in actual suspense about how the answer will come out!    (Sometimes it still is tedious, but I try to do the bare minimum of calculation necessary to point my intuition in the right direction.)</p>
<p>When I say "think in words", I mean that I have 3 main ways of thinking: using sentences that I say to myself in my mind, using mental pictures, and using mathematical symbols.</p>

<p>I suspect the proof in the first paper you linked could be done in Lean, since the essential ingredients seem to already be part of the standard library: <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/category_theory/closed/cartesian.html#category_theory.curry_natural_right">https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib_docs/category_theory/closed/cartesian.html#category_theory.curry_natural_right</a></p>
<p>You can click around to see if the definitions and lemmas you need are in there. Also note that I'm extremely biased because I only have (some very limited) experience with Lean, so I knew where to look. It's perfectly possible other proof assistants fare better in CT. If you want a somewhat idiosyncratic list of  proof assistants ranked by "how much math they have formalized" I recommend <a href="https://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/100">https://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/100</a></p>

<p>A trick to piggyback on existing proof assistants (like Agda) is to use the internal language of your categories to work in their type theory. Being careful to not use things your language hasn't (e.g. products/pairs, exponentials/arrow types), you can carry on quite a bit of proofs.<br>
I noticed it often happens that the things you actually think as trivial become really trivial (meaning the proof assistant can figure it out by itself) when done like this.<br>
I'm not sure how far you can go with this approach, though. I myself done very little stuff like this, but not because I encountered obstacles.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It seems risky to me to do this for a significantly weaker theory than the "internal language of Agda", because the proof assistant may make some assumptions that are only valid in the stronger metatheory. For example, when you have exponentials, you have distributivity of products over sums, but this isn't true in general. However, it might not be obvious that you're using that fact automatically in a proof assistant, because the role exponentials play isn't completely explicit, if all you're seeing are products and sums.</p>

<p>I think NTT or something like it can help.  The point is to take the category you're interested in and embed it by Yoneda in a category that models all the type theory of your proof assistant, including exponentials, distributivity, universes, etc.  Then whichever of those structures are preserved by the Yoneda embedding, like exponentials and products, can be used directly as operations on the "representables" inside your type theory, whereas the structures that are present in your category but aren't preserved by Yoneda, like sums, are asserted as separate structure on the representables that doesn't coincide with the structure of the ambient proof assistant type theory.</p>

<p>And if you have some structure that isn't preserved by Yoneda but does "act sufficiently like" the corresponding structure in a topos, then you can make it coincide with that of the embedding type theory by using a sheafified Yoneda embedding into a sheaf topos.  Where of course "act sufficiently like" means essentially "defines a subcanonical Grothendieck topology", i.e. "is a postulated colimit", e.g. sums that are extensive.</p>

<p>Given the effectiveness of tools like <a href="https://www.gap-system.org/">GAP</a> and the power of provers like <a href="https://vprover.github.io/">Vampire</a> (and the reasonable effectivness of things like <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/djinn">Djinn</a>), I wouldn't be surprised if one could build a somewhat effective automatic tool to discharge <em>some</em> of these "trivial" obligations.</p>
<p>Though one should note that these obligations are far from trivial from an ATP perspective.</p>
<p>I briefly tried to build the skeleton of such a system, but got distracted. I think my friend <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276026">@Philip Zucker</span> has made a more successful attempt.</p>
<p>If I had but a grad student...</p>

<p>Thanks for the ping! Yes, I've been sort of slowly plunking away at the problem of automation for category reasoning in various forms for about a year now. I don't know that anything I've done is genuinely useful as of yet.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.philipzucker.com/category-theory-in-the-e-automated-theorem-prover/">https://www.philipzucker.com/category-theory-in-the-e-automated-theorem-prover/</a> Here I tried using Automated first order logic theorem provers off the shelf to try an encode some universal properties. I'm not particularly confident my encoding is sound.</li>
</ul>
<p>I switched tracks to instead of treating universal properties, which feel more complicated, to just equational reasoning</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.philipzucker.com/notes-on-synthesis-and-equation-proving-for-catlab-jl/">https://www.philipzucker.com/notes-on-synthesis-and-equation-proving-for-catlab-jl/</a> Using ATP like Vampire and E again. This post is mostly just junk now. </li>
<li><a href="https://www.philipzucker.com/theorem-proving-for-catlab-2-lets-try-z3-this-time-nope/">https://www.philipzucker.com/theorem-proving-for-catlab-2-lets-try-z3-this-time-nope/</a> Using Z3 SMT for encoding. Seemed correct, but the encoding was too heaviweight to do anything more than trivial. Perhaps with recent lessons I could go back and tune it up.</li>
</ul>
<p>The egg paper came out <a href="https://egraphs-good.github.io/">https://egraphs-good.github.io/</a> , which describes a data structure for equational reasoning. I implemented a version here <a href="https://www.philipzucker.com/egraph-1/">https://www.philipzucker.com/egraph-1/</a> and Alessandro Cheli made a better version of that here <a href="https://github.com/0x0f0f0f/Metatheory.jl">https://github.com/0x0f0f0f/Metatheory.jl</a> . I think I have a sound system for equational reasoning in a cartesian category here, once in Julia using Metatheory.jl, once in Rust using egg.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.philipzucker.com/metatheory-progress/">https://www.philipzucker.com/metatheory-progress/</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.philipzucker.com/rust-category/">https://www.philipzucker.com/rust-category/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Currently I'm trying to fix up the data structure so that it records and prints its proofs in a human readable way and auto translating the axioms sets that are contained in the Julia package Catlab <a href="https://github.com/AlgebraicJulia/Catlab.jl">https://github.com/AlgebraicJulia/Catlab.jl</a> into my system. You may also find Catlab interesting in it's own right depending on what you want.</p>
<p>Having said all that, I suspect you'd find it most interesting to try and use Agda categories as mentioned above. <a href="https://github.com/agda/agda-categories">https://github.com/agda/agda-categories</a>  No automated system as of yet gets you all that much as far as I am aware.</p>

<p>Cool! I saw him tweet about this. I vaguely thought it was a port of the monoid solver so it mainly dealt with associativity and identity absorption. Any idea how likely the approach is to extend to complex queries?</p>

<p>The basic idea of that solver is that we want to embed our category into a nice place where equalities hold up to beta-eta equivalence, then let agda figure out the details from there. For arbitrary categories this place is the category of copresheaves, and the embedding is yoneda. This is nice insofar that the tactic has actual categorical semantics, but is a bit underpowered when it comes to adding extra stuff ontop of it.</p>
<p>I think we can do something similar with Closed Monoidal Categories using a "curried" form of day convolution, but I've yet to play with it too much</p>

<p>Yeah, it is a bit mysterious. For instance, I _dont_ think it would work with any old Monoidal Category, as the day convolutions doesn't seem to melt away in the same way that the  curried version would. This is all speculation though!</p>

<p>To elaborate, you would end up with this giant pile of tensors that you would have to sift through, whereas you can shift some stuff around when the category is closed monoidal to get rid of all of the tensors that might show up</p>

<p>Yeah, there's interesting variety in NbE-style solvers. Sometimes, you have to make extra use of the fact that expressions are given syntactically, so only finitely many elements have to be considered. The simplest example would be <a href="https://agda.github.io/agda-stdlib/Algebra.Solver.CommutativeMonoid.html">commutative monoids</a>, where expressions in <code>n</code> variables are interpreted into <code>Vec ℕ n</code> (for each variable, how many times it occurs in the expression). That is, you don't use a general free commutative monoid, but rather a specific, data-like, free commutative monoid on finite sets.</p>

<p>So the tactic works by first reifying some series of morphisms composed together into a tree, like so:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Agda"><pre><span></span><code>  <span class="kr">data</span> Expr <span class="ow">:</span> Obj <span class="ow">→</span> Obj <span class="ow">→</span> <span class="kt">Set</span> <span class="o">(</span>o ⊔ ℓ<span class="o">)</span> <span class="kr">where</span>
    <span class="nf">_∘′_</span> <span class="ow">:</span> <span class="ow">∀</span> <span class="o">{</span>A B C<span class="o">}</span> <span class="ow">→</span> Expr B C <span class="ow">→</span> Expr A B <span class="ow">→</span> Expr A C
    <span class="nf">id′</span>  <span class="ow">:</span> <span class="ow">∀</span> <span class="o">{</span>A<span class="o">}</span> <span class="ow">→</span> Expr A A
    <span class="nf">[_↑]</span> <span class="ow">:</span> <span class="ow">∀</span> <span class="o">{</span>A B<span class="o">}</span> <span class="ow">→</span> A ⇒ B <span class="ow">→</span> Expr A B
</code></pre></div>
<p>As a note on notation, <code>A ⇒ B</code> is notation for a morphism between <code>A</code> and <code>B</code></p>
<p>We then turn this reified tree of morphisms into an action on homs:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Agda"><pre><span></span><code>  <span class="nf">embed</span> <span class="ow">:</span> Expr B C <span class="ow">→</span> A ⇒ B <span class="ow">→</span> A ⇒ C
  embed <span class="o">(</span>f ∘′ g<span class="o">)</span> h  <span class="ow">=</span> embed f <span class="o">(</span>embed g h<span class="o">)</span>
  embed id′ h       <span class="ow">=</span> h
  embed [ f ↑] h    <span class="ow">=</span> f ∘ h
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is the "programming reason". We could have it be:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Agda"><pre><span></span><code>  <span class="nf">embed-contra</span> <span class="ow">:</span> Expr C A <span class="ow">→</span> A ⇒ B <span class="ow">→</span> C ⇒ B
  embed-contra <span class="o">(</span>f ∘′ g<span class="o">)</span> h <span class="ow">=</span> embed-contra g <span class="o">(</span>embed-contra f h<span class="o">)</span>
  embed-contra id′ h <span class="ow">=</span> h
  embed-contra [ x ↑] h <span class="ow">=</span> h ∘ x
</code></pre></div>
<p>But the traversal is a lot less natural</p>
<p>Full code is here if you want to take a peek :)<br>

<p>I think NTT or something like it can help.  The point is to take the category you're interested in and embed it by Yoneda in a category that models all the type theory of your proof assistant, including exponentials, distributivity, universes, etc.  Then whichever of those structures are preserved by the Yoneda embedding, like exponentials and products, can be used directly as operations on the "representables" inside your type theory, whereas the structures that are present in your category but aren't preserved by Yoneda, like sums, are asserted as separate structure on the representables that doesn't coincide with the structure of the ambient proof assistant type theory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed! And for others in the room, this is in essence also the method that we used to prove metatheoretic results such as normalization for cubical type theory, except that we pass through not only the Yoneda embedding but a further open embedding until we reach a topos whose 'internal type theory' can state the properties we want to prove.</p>
