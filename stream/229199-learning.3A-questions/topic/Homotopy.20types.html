<p>So, I've just started understanding Homotopy types from Baez's cohomology paper.</p>
<p>I'm pleasantly surprised that these seem to be the same types from Homotopy type theory.</p>
<p>I'm so pleased by this I wanted to try to make up a question about them.</p>
<p>Did Homotopy types get their name in anticipation of their application to type theory? Or is their name a coincidence?</p>
<p>I've always read "Homotopy type theory" as "homotopical style type theory" not as "the theory of Homotopy types." Where "Homotopy type" was a clearly understood topological space. I guess both reads are true, which is very fun!</p>

<p>Yes, I think it's a lucky post hoc pun; I think though I don't have a citation that the phrase "homotopy type" is 50-75 years old, much older than anybody would have been making the connection to type theory.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Did Homotopy types get their name in anticipation of their application to type theory? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>No.   Something called "the ramified theory of types" was invented by Bertrand Russell and Albert North Whitehead in their famous 1910-1912 book <em>Principia Mathematica</em>, which was trying to create a logical foundation for mathematics.  To avoid paradoxes they built a rather elaborate theory of different "types" of set.  I don't really understand it, so I'll quote a <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/a/376731/2893">MathOverflow answer</a> by Andreas Blass:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As far as I know, the word "ramified", in reference to type theory, means that one pays attention not only to the ranks of sets (where sets of rank n have members of rank n−1) but also to the complexity of their definitions. So for example, a set of fairly low rank, like a set of natural numbers, might be defined by a formula that quantifies over sets of high ranks and would be considered to have high "level". The comprehension axioms of such a type theory would impose limitations on both the ranks and the levels of the sets involved.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This rather complicated arrangement was introduced in Russell and Whitehead's "Principia Mathematica" to enforce predicativity of their type theory. Unfortunately, it proved too restrictive to serve as a foundation of ordinary mathematics, so it was supplemented with an "axiom of reducibility", saying that any set of high level is extensionally equal to (i.e., has the same members as) some set of suitably low level. Afterward (around 1920, I think) Chwistek and Ramsey (independently) noticed that the reducibility axiom had the effect of completely annihilating the structure of levels. So the theory can be reformulated by ignoring levels and working with ranks alone. This is now called either "simple type theory" or just "type theory".</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The idea of levels resurfaced in Gödel's definition of the constructible universe <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>L</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">L</span></span></span></span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eventually this sort of type theory morphed into the quite different type theory used by logicians and later computer scientists - I have no idea how!</p>
<p>Quite separately, topologists like J. H. C. Whitehead - <em>a completely different guy named Whitehead!</em> - started talking about homotopy types .   For example, in 1949 Mac Lane (yes, that guy) and Whitehead came out with a paper called <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.36.1.41">On the 3-type of a complex</a>.   In this they classified what we'd now call homotopy 2-types (since they used a dumb numbering system).  Even now people talk a lot about homotopy <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">n</span></span></span></span>-types: we say two nice topological spaces have the same homotopy <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">n</span></span></span></span>-type if they are homotopy equivalent up to dimension <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">n</span></span></span></span>.   I could be more precise, but this is the rough idea.  And we say two nice spaces have the same homotopy type if they are homotopy equivalent.</p>
<p>It seems to be just a nice coincidence that these two things called "types" turned out to be related.</p>

<p>Yes, the naming of the subject "homotopy type theory" was always a bit of a joke, or at least a double meaning: "homotopy (type theory) = (homotopy type) theory".</p>

<p>Incidentally, it's funny to remark that this joke is not possible in Romance languages, so when translating "homotopy type theory" people have to choose whether "homotopy" refers to "type" or to "theory".  Apparently, in Spanish it's "<a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teor%C3%ADa_de_tipos_homot%C3%B3pica">homotopy (type theory)</a>" ("homotopy" becomes an adjective and the feminine singular inflection betrays it's related to the theory, not the types), while the <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A9orie_homotopique_des_types">French Wikipedia</a> seems to suggest that, although "homotopy (type theory)" is more used, "(homotopy type) theory" is more correct (go figure why).  This also makes me realize that I have always been translating it wrong: I would write "<em>théorie des types homotopiques</em>", which apparently isn't a thing (I never worked in homotopy type theory, I only had to write this in some French research projects and stuff like that, so it's ok <span aria-label="big smile" class="emoji emoji-1f604" role="img" title="big smile">:big_smile:</span>).  It also makes me wonder what people say in Italian, my native tongue... (the Italian Wikipedia doesn't have a page on homotopy type theory).</p>

<p>I became curious about the invention of "homotopy type".<br>
A quick search on Scholar seems to point to the 1935 book by Hopf and Alexandrov, "Topologie" (in German), as first introducing "Homotopietypus" to refer to the equivalence class of two <em>continuous maps</em> under the relation of homotopy.<br>
In 1937, Borsuk (writing in French) then uses <em>type d'homotopie</em>, referencing Hopf and Alexandrov, in his paper <em>Sur les transformations des polyèdres acycliques en surfaces sphériques</em>, again only referring to the equivalence class of continuous maps under the homotopy relation.<br>
Then in 1938 J.H.C. Whitehead speaks of the <em>homotopy type</em> of a simplicial complex in the modern sense, apparently for the first time in <em>Simplicial spaces, nuclei and <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">m</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">m</span></span></span></span>-groups</em>. (As John points out, there is a shift in numbering so a 2-group for Whitehead seems to be the fundamental group). However Whitehead introduces the term quite casually in the introduction: the second paragraph starts with</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two complexes have the same m-group for each value of m if they have the same homotopy type.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which (at least to my "modern" ears) seems to imply an expectation that the reader will already know what this means.</p>

<p>The Hopf-Alexandrov book is the very first citation in Whitehead's paper as well, so it does seem to be the origin, but again, in the book the term seems to only ever be applied to maps and not objects.</p>

<p>It could be the case that the term had started being extended from maps to complexes in lectures/talks/private communication, so by the time of writing there was a common understanding and he didn't feel like it needed to be spelled out in the introduction. <br>
(Later in the article Whitehead does give the explicit definition of "two complexes having the same homotopy type" as "there exists a homotopy equivalence between the two complexes", so it's not like it's entirely taken for granted).</p>

<p>Another interesting point is that in 1942, in <em>On Rings of Operators. IV</em>, Murray and von Neumann define the <em>algebraical type</em> and the <em>spatial type</em> of a ring of operators in a Hilbert space as being, respectively, its isomorphism class with respect to isomorphism of rings and with respect to <em>isometric</em> isomorphism. <br>
These are first occurrences and the authors take a lot of care explaining the meaning of both terms, so it suggests that it is an early use of “type” to denote an equivalence class of objects under some notion of isomorphism. Could it have been influenced by the spread of "homotopy type"?</p>

<p>In 1940, Whitehead's <em>On the homotopy type of manifolds</em> was published in the <em>Annals of mathematics</em>, which is also where Murray and von Neumann published all the installments of <em>On rings of operators</em>, and presumably von Neumann would have been up-to-date with Annals-worthy developments.</p>

<p>Actually I'm confused.  If "théorie des types d'homotopie" is "(homotopy type) theory", then the other option "théorie homotopique des types" mentioned on the French wikipedia sounds to me as though it should translate into English as "homotopy theory of types", which is different from "homotopy (type theory)".</p>

<p>No, the pun sadly does not work: I think the customary phrasing of homotopy types in French is "types d'homotopie" rather than "types homotopiques" (and then there's also a grammatical mismatch because "homotopique" is singular in the first case, but should be plural in the second).</p>

<p>Ah, so I wasn't completely wrong!  I just thought there was an "s" at the end, which is silent anyway so it sounds the same.  But now I understand that "types homotopiques" simply doesn't exist, it's "types d'homotopie", as you say.</p>

<p>Yes.  In fact, as Kenji says,  "théorie des types homotopique" may be a better rendering of "homotopy (type theory)" than Wikipedia's "théorie homotopique des types", because it suggests that it's the whole "type theory" that is "homotopical", not just the "theory".  But it's really a matter of taste, technically the adjective "homotopique" is related to the noun "théorie", whether you place it right after or at the end, so both expressions literally translate in English as "homotopical theory of types" (admitting that the adjective "homotopical" exists in English, which I am not sure it does).  The literal translation of the other option mentioned on Wikipedia is "theory of types of homotopy".</p>

<p>Actually, now that I think about it, I don't understand why people, both in Spanish and French, resorted to the adjective "homotopical" to render "homotopy (type theory)".</p>
<p>English compound nouns of the form "X Y" where both X and Y are nouns are rendered in Romance languages as "Y of X".  E.g. "work permit" becomes "permit of work".  Similarly, "type theory" = "theory of types", "homotopy type" = "type of homotopy", and also "homotopy theory" = "theory of homotopy".</p>
<p>Following the above, "(homotopy type) theory" becomes "theory of types of homotopy", which, as I mentioned, is the literal translation of "théorie des types d'homotopie".  But then "homotopy (type theory)" should become "theory of homotopy of types", which is the literal translation of "théorie de l'homotopie des types".  As far as I know, nobody has ever used this expression in French, but to me it sounds like a very adequate description of the subject, possibly more than both expressions using the adjective "homotopique"/"homotopical".  I mean, isn't HoTT about seeing types as spaces, and then studying them from the viewpoint of homotopy theory?</p>
<p>Of course I am not advocating for changing the terminology, it's just curious that the most direct and obvious translation isn't the one that ended up being used.</p>

<p>Some people in English have said "homotopical type theory", particularly I think in the early days of the subject before terminology settled down.  Maybe the Romance languages picked up on that and then didn't settle the same way English did.</p>

<p>Another interesting point is that in 1942, in <em>On Rings of Operators. IV</em>, Murray and von Neumann define the <em>algebraical type</em> and the <em>spatial type</em> of a ring of operators in a Hilbert space as being, respectively, its isomorphism class with respect to isomorphism of rings and with respect to <em>isometric</em> isomorphism. <br>
These are first occurrences and the authors take a lot of care explaining the meaning of both terms, so it suggests that it is an early use of “type” to denote an equivalence class of objects under some notion of isomorphism. Could it have been influenced by the spread of "homotopy type"?</p>

<p>Good point <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="492072">@Vincent R.B. Blazy</span> . Order type had a much older history: it seems to date back to a 1884 paper by Georg Cantor, <em>Prinzipien einer Theorie der Ordnungstypen</em>.</p>

<p>So it seems plausible that in the 1930s mathematicians start thinking more and more about "notions of isomorphism" and equivalence classes under those notions, and they have "order types" as the obvious already-established instance that can be generalised.</p>

<p>Obviously Russell was deeply influenced by Cantor, so it would be very neat if somehow also his use of "type" had its origin in Cantor, but that seems a bit of a stretch :)</p>
