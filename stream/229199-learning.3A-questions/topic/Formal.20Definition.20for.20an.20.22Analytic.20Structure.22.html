<p>Hi, this is my first main post here. Thanks to all who can provide suggestions and answers! Oh also I'll try to make my posts more concise next time (sorry about the length)!<br>
So, when you are in middle or high school, you are entered into a class titled "algebra" where you learn about the so-called rules of algebra. When you don't follow these rules, you are marked incorrect- it's as if these rules are THE rules of THE algebra, and there's no other way it could be. But then you get to college and learn the field of abstract algebra. In the process, you learn that THE algebra from school is just a tiny drop in an infinite sea of differing algebraic universes, each with their own "rules" of algebra. These universes are known as "algebraic structures" and include everything from magmas to groups and monoids to rings and fields to vector spaces and algebras over vector spaces. In the process, THE algebra from school is just AN algebra(ic structure) among many others. And from a categorical POV, algebraic structures are not hard to define- they are just algebraic objects in Set, where an algebraic object in a category with finite products (or tensor product) is an object A equipped with (one or more) "operation morphism" A x A -&gt; A participating in diagrams encoding certain "properties" such as associativity, commutativity, identity, inversion, etc. This is a classic example of a formal definition in "stuff, structure, property" format, IE, "An algebraic structure is a set A equipped with morphism(s) A x A -&gt; A such that..."</p>

<p>After they learn algebra in school, many students will move on to the dreaded course of calculus! There, they learn about limits, derivatives, integrals, and the fundamental theorem of calculus. Again, there are rules to follow, and again students learn about alternate rules when they get to college. There, they learn THE calculus they learned in high school is a type of "real analysis", but other "analyses" exist such as complex analysis and vector calculus. So here's my question: is there a such thing as AN "analytic structure" that generalizes THE calculus learned in high school, directly analagous to how AN "algebraic structure" generalizes THE algebra learned in high school, such that THE calculus is just one of many in an infinite sea of different calculus/analysis universes? If so, is there a subject of "abstract analysis" that studies it directly analagous to abstract algebra, and then what is the corresponding formal/internal definition of an analytic object such that an analytic structure is defined as an analytic object internal to Set? Preferably, in "stuff, structure, property" format: "An analytic structure is a set A equipped with structure S such that..."</p>

<p>Here's my thoughts so far. I believe whatever it is, an analytic structure needs to have an underlying algebraic structure. This is because analysis needs to be built on a concept of "linearity", with these linear operations being identified with the underlying algebraic operations. For instance, take some 1d continuous function and zoom into a point until the infinitesimal scale, then apply the derivative operator. The application will look like applying some linear transformation in that neighborhood, which is usually some sort of scaling- which is just multiplication, an algebraic operation. Likewise, when defining an integral, one imagines dividing up the area under a 1d function into infinitesimal tiny rectangles and adding them up, where rectangles are linear objects (whose areas are b*h, again multiplication). So a common theme in THE calculus we learned, that we can approximate continuous things with tiny infinitesimal linear things, is likely something that needs to carry over to analytic structures in general, in which case we need that definition of linearity that an algebraic structure will be able to provide.</p>

<p>My guess is that the underlying algebraic structure is some sort of algebra over a field, though maybe generalizations are possible to other algebraic structures. Under this, it seems then that "THE calculus" is just an analytic structure defined over the algebraic structure of the real numbers. In a similar vein, "complex analysis" is just an analytic structure defined over the algebraic structure of the complex numbers. "Vector calculus" could be an analytic structure defined over the algebraic structure of linear algebra. There also always seems to be some concept of an analogy to the fundamental theorem of calculus associated to each analytic structure here (like Stokes theorem for vector calculus, which reduces to things like Green or Divergence theorem). I'm wondering if that's always true for any analytic structure. Related to this is if it is always possible to define both an integral and derivative operator in any analytic structure, or if there are some analytic structures that only contain one or the other. In vector calculus, we actually have multiple (such as divergence, gradient, and curl for derivative operators and line, surface, volume integrals for integral operators)</p>
<p>Let me know if I'm on the right track, or any track at all, with any of this. Thanks!</p>

<p>Synthetic differential geometry has the kind of axiomatic vibe that I'm getting from your question, but it's not presented as being quite as fundamental as what you're aiming for.</p>
<p>Also vaguely related are the (sheaves of) differentials used to construct de Rham cohomology. They're a formal algebraic version of the differentials in analysis. I took a cohomology course where a version of Stokes' theorem was proved using these. (Sorry that that's vague, I can dig up more details if it sounds relevant.)</p>
<p>Maybe you can figure it out from first principles: what are the operations featuring in an "abstract calculus", and by extension what features do you need an object to have in order to count as one?</p>

<p>I think the concept of "limits" and of "continuity" are important to calculus and real analysis. The particular way in which those concepts are handled I assume would depend on how one is modelling "topological aspects". We could imagine having different "topological structures" - different ways of doing topology, analogous to how "algebraic structures" are different ways of doing algebra. And indeed, there are things called "topological constructs", which I think are like different settings in which one can do topology-like things.</p>

<p>Interesting, thanks for the answers! It seems what I am gathering from all the above is that it is not possible to do analysis without some notion of underlying "space", whether that be from differential geometry, cohomology, a topological construct, a banach space, etc. So you can't just have some set and an underlying algebraic structure, you would also need some sort of a space structure to define an abstract analysis.<br>
I also gather that what will be the most general "underlying space" to define these analytic structures will depend on the set of concepts I (maybe arbitrarily) define to be sufficient for analysis (tying into Morgan and David's comment). If convergence is all I need, then a convergent space is the most general space, but if I need both convergence and continuity, then a topological space will be. If I also want to be able to define uniformity, then I will need a uniform space. Integrals, as far as I know, require measure theory to properly define, so if I want integrals in addition to the above I'll need a measure structure on the space too (IE, it will need to be a measurable topological space).</p>

<p>Following from Dr. Shulman's response, once I have a reasonable space, I can combine the space structure with an algebraic structure by analyzing vector spaces (or more generally modules) internal to the categories of those spaces. For instance, topological vector spaces are vector spaces internal to Top, and a Banach space seems to have an underlying TVS with even more extra analytic structure added on top. However, at this point I will need to learn more about Banach spaces and related spaces since admittedly I haven't taken any extremely rigorous real analysis courses that would likely cover such things. For instance, I am unsure how "vector measures" that allow for integration in Banach spaces come into being. I know that if a topological group's underlying topology satisfies certain properties (local compactness), it somehow gains a natural "Haar measure"; is something similar happening here? How does this measure work, and would it make specifying the underlying topological space to be a measurable topological space redundant? Lastly, do you think it would make sense to define an analytic structure in the most general case as a vector space internal to a category of spaces?</p>

<p>While there is some dependence, I was suggesting that you try and extract the "type" of these various operations. In the same way that you have a general concept of an algebra in terms of finitary operations, if you can find some commonality of type then you don't have to be as specific. For example, to define convergence spaces you need a notion of distinguished "net", and the structure of convergence is a map from the space of such sequences back to the space satisfying certain constraints. It might be possible to make generalize "net" to other shapes and still prove analogous results.</p>
<p>There is a reverse mathematics flavour to this pursuit, where a tangible goal would be to isolate the features of integration etc that enable one to conclude certain properties or results.</p>

<p>I'll check out algebraic analysis, thanks for the links! In the meantime, I've been struggling to reconcile two ideas. As Dr. Schulman noted, analysis can be done in a Banach space. However, in differential geometry, one defines calculus to be set on a differentiable manifold. How do these two seemingly entirely separate concepts connect? Does differentiable structure added onto a topological manifold also instantly grant Banach structure in some way?</p>

<p>You can do calculus on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_manifold">Banach manifolds</a> and this is quite useful when studying nonlinear differential equations.   As the Wikipedia article points out, we can go further and work with Fréchet manifolds (or even more general kinds of infinite-dimensional manifolds).   But for hard analysis, Banach manifolds are more practical.  I used to use them a fair amount.  For "soft" work on differential geometry it often pays to use the still more general <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffeology">diffeological spaces</a>, and people who like category theory tend to enjoy these.</p>

<p>Thanks for the help! There's still two things that confuse me. First, where do vector bundles and tangent bundles come in when discussing calculus on a differentiable manifold? Does the ability to do calculus come from the tangent/vector bundle defined on the manifold, or does it come from the manifold looking locally like a Euclidean vector space? The second question is about how derivatives are even taken using Banach spaces. As a vector space, the canonical morphism between Banach spaces are continuous linear maps unless I am mistaken. However, what if I wanted to take the derivative of a nonlinear function? How am I supposed to represent that operation? Thanks!</p>

<p>As for your first question, the ability to define the tangent space of a manifold comes from the fact that a manifold 'looks locally like a vector space'.   The intuition is that when you zoom in to a point on a manifold, its infinitesimal neighborhood looks like a vector space, and that vector space is the tangent space of that point.  Of course what I'm saying is rather vague.  To make it precise you have to fill in a bunch of details - or read a book that does.  Actually it can't hurt to read all of this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_manifold">Differentiable manifold</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't think general <em>vector</em> bundles are so important here: right now you're wondering about the basics of calculus on a manifold, and that mainly requires that you understand the <em>tangent</em> bundle.</p>
<p>As for your second question, derivatives of differentiable maps between Banach spaces are taken the same way as for differentiable maps between Euclidean vector spaces.   This subject is explained reasonably well here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9chet_derivative#Definition">Fréchet derivative: definition</a>.</li>

<p>Thanks, the manifold stuff makes sense now. I looked at that page before where it said a chart is an assignment of an open subset of a manifold to an open subset of Euclidean space that is a homeomorphism. But the page left it extremely vague as to if "Euclidean space" in this context is topological Euclidean space or topological vector space Euclidean space (only the latter of which would make sense in getting the manifold to look locally like a vector space), which was probably what was confusing me. An atlas is then a way of "gluing" the charts so they are compatible. This reminds me of sheaves in a way, since they also correspond to gluing and also have to do with open subsets. Any connection?<br>
As for the second point (and using the notation given in the wikipedia article), my concern is with a possible typing error in the expression f: U -&gt; W. A morphism between topological vector spaces (TVS), Euclidean space included, is of the "continuous linear map" type. The article on Frechet derivative acknowledges this by stating the derivative as a bounded linear operator A: V -&gt; W, which makes sense as bounded linear operators are a case of continuous linear map. However, this means trying to define a morphism of "nonlinear continuous function" type between TVS is impossible since this results in a typing error; the morphism and the object are incompatible (IE, we are using a morphism from one category and objects from another). In this case, we are using objects from some category of TVS, and morphisms from Top (or at least some subcategory of Top). Perhaps this is where manifolds come in: instead of V and W being TVS, they are TVS manifolds (like Banach manifolds or differentiable manifolds), which do have a notion of nonlinear map between them. Any thoughts?</p>

<p>This makes sense, thanks. I do understand why the wikipedia article is written the way it is, it's because most mathematics is considered (implicitly in most cases) from a set theoretic perspective where everything is of type Set and so defining a function between anything is possible and makes sense. I wanted to think of this from the category theoretic perspective which is where the issue arose. It's likely there are other ways of going about this that are more "friendly" to category theory (such as synthetic differential geometry), which I plan to investigate further in the future!</p>

<p>I did have another question about manifolds going off on what was said above about how R^n can have different structure depending on the category. If R^n is a topological space only and used in a chart for an atlas, one gets a topological manifold. If R^n is given topological vector space structure and used in a differentiable atlas, one can assign a tangent space to points on the generated manifold and so the resulting manifold defined using that atlas is differentiable. However, I am confused when it comes to defining metrics on a manifold (like in Riemannian geometry with metric tensors and the like). There are certain explicit ways of starting with some smooth manifold (a type of differentiable manifold) and then giving it a metric structure. On the other hand, one can give a metric structure instead to the topological vector space R^n, turning it into a normed topological vector space R^n. One can then use this in an atlas to define a manifold. How do these two ways of giving a metric connect? Are they essentially equivalent?</p>

<p>Related to this is if it is always possible to define both an integral and derivative operator in any analytic structure, or if there are some analytic structures that only contain one or the other. In vector calculus, we actually have multiple (such as divergence, gradient, and curl for derivative operators and line, surface, volume integrals for integral operators)</p>
<p>Let me know if I'm on the right track, or any track at all, with any of this. Thanks!</p>

<p>In the field of differential categories, we have differential categories which axiomatize differentiation and integral categories which axiomatize integration. A category which is equipped with the two structures at the same time in a compatible way is named a calculus categoy. I think that some differential categories can't be made into a calculus category and in the same way some integral categories can't be made into a calculus category.</p>
<p>I don't know about examples because I know only about differential categories and not about integral and calculus categories which are more recent. But for sure <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277105">@JS PL (he/him)</span> will know as he introduced integral and calculus categories in his master thesis.

<p>I'm not sure of the exact conditions but every symmetric monoidal category enriched over the category of commutative monoids which can be equipped with a free commutative algebra modality which is not too bad is a codifferential category (ie. its opposite is a differential category) and this is a very weak condition.</p>

<p>This is all interesting! It sounds a little like the concept of an algebraic category or a topological category. Various algebraic objects like groups, monoids, etc. form an algebraic category, while various space like objects form a topological category. Maybe various analytic objects form differential or integral categories? So as algebraic categories are settings for algebra, differential categories are the various settings for analysis? Hope I'm on the right track... I wonder what other categories are differential, for instance diffeological spaces, smooth spaces, orbifolds, etc.</p>

<p>If you want categories of differentiable maps, you must use the notion of cartesian differential categories which are categories with finite products and additional structure which allows also to define differentiation, but starting from the differentiable maps and not the linear maps this time.</p>

<p>Would you happen to have any concrete examples of how to do things inside a differential category to illustrate? For instance, in the category of smooth manifolds, differentiation is an endofunctor that sends a manifold to its tangent bundle and a function to its derivative. Does this tie in to the concept of a differential category and monads (which are a type of endofunctor) on it? If so then how does differentiation on a differentiable manifold "look like" within the context of the differential category they form?</p>

<p>I'm not sure how to write it using polynomials and coordinates but with the symmetric algebra, it is the natural way to compose: you have two levels of symmetric tensors, and then you flatten everything to the same level.</p>

<p>Thanks for the information and for all your help! It was very well explained. I'll check out the resources and everything, its a very interesting topic! <br>
This may sound like a goofy question and it's probably silly. But what if you were asked to find the derivative of the function x^2 or e^x evaluated at x = 1, but the catch is you have to completely use the machinery of some differential category to solve the problem. How do you go about approaching that problem?<br>
A second question is how a tangent category relates to a differential category.</p>

<p>I have no idea how to obtain a differential category from a tangent category. But maybe you can use some category of the vector bundles of your tangent category and for instance apply the symmetric algebra on it to obtain your modality <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">!</mo><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">!A</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6944em;"></span><span class="mclose">!</span><span class="mord mathnormal">A</span></span></span></span>. It would be quite weird but there is a paper doing something like this, not starting from an arbitrary tangent category but from the category of smooth manifolds:</p>

<p>This is quite plausible that a general process could be adapted from this paper to obtain a differential category from any tangent category.</p>

<p>However, I am confused when it comes to defining metrics on a manifold (like in Riemannian geometry with metric tensors and the like). There are certain explicit ways of starting with some smooth manifold (a type of differentiable manifold) and then giving it a metric structure. On the other hand, one can give a metric structure instead to the topological vector space R^n, turning it into a normed topological vector space R^n. One can then use this in an atlas to define a manifold. How do these two ways of giving a metric connect? Are they essentially equivalent?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second way sounds much more restrictive, since every chart would be a copy of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi mathvariant="double-struck">R</mi><mi>n</mi></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{R}^n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6889em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathbb">R</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.6644em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mathnormal mtight">n</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> with its flat metric, so you'd only get <em>flat</em> Riemannian manifolds.   I'm assuming that the first way - which you didn't really explain in detail, you just mentioned "certain explicit ways" - you are talking about the usual definition of Riemannian manifolds.</p>

<p>The second way is much more rarely used; I might have seen it used somewhere, but people are vastly more likely to just talk about flat Riemannian manifolds.</p>

<p>Late to the discussion, but yes absolutely always happy to discuss differential categories. As it might be what you're looking for. <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="428716">@Jean-Baptiste Vienney</span> did a good job discussing differential categories, but another kind of category might better fit what you are looking for. They fit more in the direction <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="383799">@Tom Hirschowitz</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277473">@Morgan Rogers (he/him)</span>  were going towards, which are <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/tangent+bundle+category">Tangent Categories</a> in the sense of Cockett and Cruttwell. (I don't know if the nlab page is complete, so here are some <a href="https://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~robin/FMCS/FMCS2022/slides/JS.pdf">slides</a>) </p>
<p>Essentially a tangent category is a category where every object <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">A</span></span></span></span> has an associated object <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T(A)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">T</span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathnormal">A</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span> which behaves like an abstract tangent bundle over <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">A</span></span></span></span>. The canonical example is the category of smooth manifolds, but there are also lots of other examples in particular like synthetic differential geometry and (affine) schemes. They are also very much linked to the differential categories <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="428716">@Jean-Baptiste Vienney</span> was talking about above. Tangent categories have been particularly successful in formalizing numerous concepts from differential geometry. So they might be a suitable setting for what you which to achieve.</p>
