<p>In my previous discussion we discussed many kinds of space and generalizations of space, such as how locales generalize (sober) spaces and toposes generalize those. We also discussed pretopological spaces for a bit. So I looked more into all these different kinds of "topological-esque" spaces and found many interesting kinds. But I now want to organize them all into a hierarchy, and so I will need to know which one to put at "the top"- in other words, find a notion of "topological-esque" space that includes all the others, if such a thing is even possible!</p>
<p>To start, we can generalize topological spaces to <em>convergence spaces</em>, which also includes pretopological and pseudotopological spaces. Beyond that, we can directly relax axioms to get to <em>filter space</em> and eventually to <em>preconvergence space</em>. Meanwhile, separately, the nlab page for convergence space gives us another direction of generalization of convergence space: to <em><a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/convergence+space#cluster_spaces">cluster spaces</a></em>. Furthermore, just as one can see topological spaces as a particular kind of approach space, one can see a convergence space as a kind of <em><a href="https://digitalcommons.georgiasouthern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2115&amp;context=etd">convergence approach space</a></em>. Next, we can more directly generalize topological spaces to <em>syntopogenous spaces</em> and <em>quasi-topological spaces</em>, but the connection to convergence spaces there is unclear. Lastly, one has a notion of <em><a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/apartness+space#pointset_apartness_spaces">apartness space</a></em> given under this nlab article which doesn't appear to generalize topological spaces, but also doesn't appear to be generalized by them. There might also be other kinds of non-topological (or generalizations of topological) "topological-esque" space that I'm missing, so feel free to fill me in on more if you have them!</p>

<p>So here's my questions: for all the spaces I mentioned above (the ones in italics), how would you arrange them in a hierarchy (thus, which one is the "most general")? And if this poset of generality doesn't have a greatest element - that is, none of the spaces I mentioned subsume all the other spaces I mentioned- then which notion of space IS "the most general"? That is, such that the categories of all "topological-esque" spaces I mentioned above embed fully faithfully into this category of "most general spaces". In other words- what is the one "topological-esque" space to rule them all? Thanks!</p>

<p>Presumably as you keep generalizing you lose more and more useful properties until you get something like "object in an <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord">∞</span></span></span></span>-category".</p>

<p>Thanks. I guess I figured it would be difficult to define a "most general" notion of space. But I at least still want to unpack more about the relationships between the kinds of space mentioned.</p>
<p>It seems that the first few kinds of space I mentioned take "filters" to be fundamental. A preconvergence space is any set equipped with a relation, known as the convergence relation, between the set of filters and the set itself. If a filter is paired with a certain point in the set by this relation, then it is said to "converge" to that point, and that point is the "limit" of the filter. In essence, this is defining the notion of "limit" as "extra structure" on a set. Of course, pseudotopological, convergence, and filter spaces are special cases as one then imposes additional axioms on these binary relations. I also speculate that cluster spaces are a special case of preconvergence space since they also involve a binary relation with the filter set. But this time it's a "clustering" relation rather than a "convergence" one. Still, since any such relation qualifies as a preconvergence space, I would say this makes cluster spaces preconvergence spaces.</p>

<p>I hope that all sounds reasonable so far! But I do have some more questions about filters because I want to make sure I understand them well enough to figure out how these kinds of space are interrelated. I'm still not clear on exactly what a filter is supposed to be. For instance, how do you construct the set of all filters on a set (the very set that the binary relation exists between to get a preconvergence space)? Is it related in any way to the powerset of the set, and if so, how?</p>

<p>I've never heard of the term "preconvergence space", but the most general concept of such spaces built out of filters is a set equipped with a relation between that set and the set of its filters.</p>

<p>Oh I see, the nLab has an article on <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/preconvergence%20spaces">[[preconvergence spaces]]</a>. I suspect this might be another instance of nLab authors coming up with new names for mathematical structures because there aren't any names being used for this structure in the existing published literature.</p>

<p>Here's my next main question. In math class we learn about the definition of a limit of a function in terms of "epsilon-delta". Meanwhile, in a convergence space, the notion of limit is given not in terms of some "epsilon-delta" machinery, but in terms of the actual structure put on the set to make it into a convergence space. What I want to know is: how do these two notions of specifying a limit converge? For instance, is it possible to, given a function and a point in the domain, find a corresponding filter such that all limits of that filter (in terms of convergence spaces) coincides perfectly with all limits of that function at that point (in terms of epsilon-delta)? </p>
<p>Also, let's say that there is a way of doing this. The whole reason why limits of functions are useful in the first place is <em>because</em> they can be defined for discontinuous functions. Otherwise we'd just always take the value of a function at a point! But according to nlab, the functions in the category <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">C</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">o</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">n</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">v</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{Conv}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm" style="margin-right:0.01389em;">Conv</span></span></span></span></span> - even in spite of convergence spaces being more general than topological spaces- are <em>still</em> "continuous", at least in some sense of the term. So when the only functions between convergence spaces are continuous, what exactly would it even <em>mean</em> to take a limit of a discontinuous function- either in terms of convergence spaces or in terms of epsilon delta, categorically speaking?</p>

<p>Anyway, it's not true that the only functions between convergence spaces are continuous.  The <em>morphisms</em> in the category of convergence spaces are the continuous ones, but we can certainly talk about discontinuous functions between (the underlying sets of) convergence spaces.</p>

<p>That's interesting, I've never heard of a gauge space before. On my first thought I thought it had to do with gauge theory (so principal bundles, smooth manifolds, and all that) but it looks like something very different to that! From what I have read so far, I can see epsilon-delta working just fine for a typical gauge space since gauge spaces are topological spaces. I might object to this working for quasi-gauge spaces since the article almost made it sound like not every quasi-gauge space was a topological space.</p>

<p>Yes, totally different meaning of "gauge".</p>

<p>No, every quasigauge space has an underlying topology, and moreover every topological space can be induced by a quasigauge.</p>

Maybe I'm thinking backwards since normally a Kleisli morphism is into the monad applied to an object, but I think this still works! Maybe it's like a "co-Kliesli" morphism of some sort...</p>

<p>When I was revisiting the nlab page for "<a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/filter">filter</a>", I saw the following paragraph: "Filters of subsets form a category whose simplicial category provides a somewhat more formalisation of the intuition of “nearness” than the usual topological one; in particular, it contains the categories of topological and of uniform spaces, of simplicial sets, and of filters themselves, allowing to reformulate in terms of this category notions such as limit, equicontinuity, locally trivial, and geometric realization."<br>
I'm interested in understanding this passage. I know a topological space, and many of its generalizations, can be described as the set of filters equipped with a binary relation of "convergence". But this approach seems to be different- it's taking filters themselves as fundamental, not a relation on filters. I'm therefore wondering how exactly this generalizes topological spaces, and connects with the notion of a topological space as a relation on filters rather than a simplicial object in the category of filters.</p>

To clarify, consider the category <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">G</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">r</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">p</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{Grp}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8778em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">Grp</span></span></span></span></span>. The act of "taking the product" of two elements of a group isn't something that's done in the ambient category- it's something that's done <em>inside</em> a group inside <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">G</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">r</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">p</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{Grp}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8778em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">Grp</span></span></span></span></span>. There isn't anything in the ambient category that allows you to define "taking a product of elements" (and if it does, maybe it's a coincidence and probably doesn't generalize well to other "sets with binary products"). Instead, the product is defined- and taken- in <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">e</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{Set}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">Set</span></span></span></span></span>. So somehow, not everything you can do related to a mathematical object "makes it into" the actual category of those mathematical objects.<br>
Anyways, I hope I'm making sense. Am I on to something here or am I going math crazy?</p>

<p>I strongly suspect that the page <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/situs">[[situs]]</a> was added by Misha Gavrilovich. Certainly has his own ideas, and that page has broken formatting etc (and is not really a good fit for the nLab), but I wouldn't call him a crank.

<p>Ok, well, I think at least that paragraph should be removed from the "Idea" section as it suggests this is a fundamental and well-established use of filters.  It would be more appropriate in a "related pages" section.</p>

<p>So I've been reading more into defining spaces in terms of "distance", and came across approach spaces. I think they are interesting but there's a few points I'm confused about. First, every quasi-pseudometric <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>d</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">d</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6944em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">d</span></span></span></span> ("Lawvere metric space") gives rise to an approach metric <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>D</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">D</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.02778em;">D</span></span></span></span> in accordance with <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>D</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>A</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">i</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">n</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">f</mi></mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>d</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>a</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>:</mo><mi>a</mi><mo>∈</mo><mi>A</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">D(x,A) = \mathrm{inf}(d(x,a): a \in A)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.02778em;">D</span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathnormal">x</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">A</span><span class="mclose">)</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">=</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm" style="margin-right:0.07778em;">inf</span></span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathnormal">d</span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathnormal">x</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">a</span><span class="mclose">)</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">:</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.5782em;vertical-align:-0.0391em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">a</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">∈</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">A</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span>. But also, every quasi-pseudometric has an underlying topological space, which itself can be given an approach metric. However, the approach metric for a topological space is always two-valued. Thus, the approach metric for a quasi-pseudometric space and its underlying topological set are somehow different from one another! My question is: is there any way to connect them (well, besides a potential manual way of doing it, maybe I'm looking for a way of doing the conversion without ever stepping foot in <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">T</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">o</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">p</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{Top}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8778em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">Top</span></span></span></span></span> and so working entirely with approach metrics, if possible).</p>
<p>My second question is about the specific way that gauge spaces- and also importantly quasi gauge spaces- intersect with approach spaces. The nlab for "<a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/approach+space#Examples">approach space</a>" gives a conversion from a gauge- in fact a gauge base- to approach metric, but it differs from the one that wikipedia gives <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approach_space#Equivalent_definitions">here</a>. The one on Wikipedia even seems to be defining not a gauge but a quasigauge, but I could be wrong. Wikipedia also insists that the conversion from gauge to approach metric is "invertible"- does this imply an equivalence of categories somewhere? Thanks for helping me untangle these notions!</p>

<p>Hi! Thanks so much for the pdf link to the book. I've already gone through a large part of it and I'm blown away by the amount of different kinds of "space" are classified by the (relatively) simple (T,V)-algebra scheme (as well as its extensions to (T,V)-graphs and such).</p>

<p>I am a little disappointed the book never mentions "convergence space" by name directly.

<p>Update to the above: I reviewed the book and it actually states outright that <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>F</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>2</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mrow><mo>−</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">R</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">G</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">r</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">p</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">h</mi></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">(F,2)\mathrm{-RGrph}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">F</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord">2</span><span class="mclose">)</span><span class="mord"><span class="mord">−</span><span class="mord mathrm">RGrph</span></span></span></span></span> corresponds to the first two axioms ("centrality" and "isotone") of any convergence relation. So going by the nlab this would qualify as a "filter space", but many authors also call it a "convergence space". So I guess it depends on the terminology used! Then upgrading the right unital property to the unital property gets to the category <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>F</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>2</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mrow><mo>−</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">U</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">G</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">r</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">p</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">h</mi></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">(F,2)\mathrm{-UGrph}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">F</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord">2</span><span class="mclose">)</span><span class="mord"><span class="mord">−</span><span class="mord mathrm">UGrph</span></span></span></span></span>, which is just pretopological spaces. It thus makes me wonder if one can define a property "between" being right unital and unital to get the nlab's convergence space (whose third axiom of being "directional" is a much weakened version of the third axiom of pretopological spaces). One doesn't seem immediately apparent but it might just be a more complicated property.</p>

<p>To be completely explicit, if you look at the expanded definition of a T-monoid (e.g. immediately after Definition 4.3), you will see that it has exactly the structure of a "lax loose T-algebra" in a suitable sense. So there really is no difference between T-monoids and lax T-algebras. (See also the remark at the end of section 2 in Day and Street's paper <a href="http://science.mq.edu.au/~street/Multicats.pdf">Lax monoids, pseudo-operads, and convolution</a>.)</p>

<p>That seems quite odd! If it's really true, then wouldn't this imply that every single algebraic structure is a "generalized multicategory"? After all, if you define an "algebraic structure" to be a model of a Lawvere theory, then you know all such models are equivalent to algebras for some finitary monad on <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">e</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{Set}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">Set</span></span></span></span></span>. But if all algebraic structures are algebras of some monad, and all monad algebras are monoids in the horizontal Kleisli category for that monad (are generalized multicategories), then it follows that algebraic structures are generalized multicategories, no? I'm confused!</p>

<p>Well, there are some conditions on the monad so that it lifts to some double category and you can define a horizontal Kleisli construction for it.  But modulo that, yes, every algebraic structure gives rise to a generalized multicategory, in the same way that every monoidal category gives rise to an ordinary multicategory.  Of course, not every generalized multicategory arises in this way, only the "representable" ones.</p>

<p>What generalized multicategories are <em>the same as</em> is <em>lax</em> algebras for the induced monad on the horizontal bicategory.  Which are more general than ordinary strict algebras for the original monad on the vertical category.</p>

<p>Yes, if you're willing to consider "degenerate" double categories like Sq(Set), you can do that.  But note that Sq(Set) is not an equipment, and the theory of generalized multicategories works better with an equipment.</p>

<p>Ah, good to know!<br>
I did some more reading of the article in the context of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">V</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">M</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{VMat}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">VMat</span></span></span></span></span> and I had some questions about it. First, the article only mentions <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>V</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">V</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.22222em;">V</span></span></span></span> up to being a monoidal category. But VDC theory allows you to enrich in objects beyond monoidal categories, up to and including VDCs themselves. In fact, a monoidal category is just a one object bicategory, which is just a special kind of double category, which is just a special kind of VDC. This leads me to wonder why the paper never talks about <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">V</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">M</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{VMat}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">VMat</span></span></span></span></span> for <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>V</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">V</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.22222em;">V</span></span></span></span> a general VDC, and if its category of monads <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">M</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">o</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">d</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">V</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">M</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">t</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{Mod(VMat)}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">Mod</span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathrm">VMat</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span></span> will correspond precisely with VDC-enriched categories. </p>

But I'm not exactly sure if- or even how- this would work, since how can you index objects of one category with something other than a set?</p>
<p>In addition, I wanted to ask about the "chirality" of VDCs in general. Unlike lower categories, VDCs appear inherently chiral in that the appropriate notion of map between them are <em>lax</em> functors. But there's another notion of <em>oplax</em> functor that could also have been chosen. I guess my question is- how is this chirality resolved, and how do you define an oplax functor between VDCs? Is there a way to "convert" a general oplax functor into a lax functor? For instance, say I have an oplax functor between two double categories <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>F</mi><mo>:</mo><mi>C</mi><mo>→</mo><mi>D</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">F: C \to D</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">F</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">:</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07153em;">C</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">→</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.02778em;">D</span></span></span></span>.

<p>By postulating it.  You have to <em>start</em> with an indexed monoidal category; you can't expect to make one if you're just given a category C and a monoidal category M.</p>

<p>I don't know of any.  I mean, you can observe that your VDCs are representable and define an oplax map between representable VDCs, but that's really just going back to double categories.</p>

<p>What I want to think about now is how multicategories are dealt with from the monoidal fibrations perspective (since this wasn't, at least not that I believe, mentioned explicitly in the paper). So an internal category is one corresponding to the self-indexing monoidal fibration, and an enriched category is one corresponding to the family indexing monoidal fibration. What are the corresponding analogous monoidal fibrations that give rise to both internal and enriched multicategories? And how does this tie in with multicategories being <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">T</span></span></span></span>-multicategories where <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">T</span></span></span></span> is the free monoid monad on <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">e</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{Set}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">Set</span></span></span></span></span>?</p>

<p>I would back up a further step and ask whether there are any other interesting Set-indexed monoidal categories.  (If you said "indexed" you don't also have to say "fibration" -- an indexed category is equivalent to a fibration.)  In fact any Set-indexed category that satisfies the natural condition of being "a stack for the canonical topology on Set" is automatically of the form Fam(V).  There are Set-indexed monoidal categories that aren't stacks (e.g. any <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/tripos">[[tripos]]</a>), but they're arguably a bit esoteric.</p>

<p>On the other hand, even the question of whether a monad on Set extends to <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>V</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">M</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">t</mi></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">V\rm Mat</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.22222em;">V</span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">Mat</span></span></span></span></span> is nontrivial.

I don't know a general answer to this question either, but there are certainly examples.  E.g. there is an indexed monoidal category of abelian-group objects over any topos, and the free monoid monad on the topos should extend to it, yielding a notion of "internal additive multicategory".</p>

<p>Here's something I've been thinking of in terms of "extending monads". Every finitary monad on <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">e</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{Set}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">Set</span></span></span></span></span> corresponds with a Lawvere theory. While monads aren't very extendable in general, theories very much are- all you have to do is just change the target category of your finite product preserving functor (so long as that category also has finite products). So while a "free monoid" monad only exists for some small number of categories, given a finite products category you can derive the category of monoids internal to it with ease via the Lawvere theory. Maybe something like this could be used in some way to figure out if a monad on <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">e</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{Set}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">Set</span></span></span></span></span> can be extended. Or even better, perhaps generalized multicategory theory itself can be reformulated in a theory-centric way as opposed to a monad-centric way. For instance, just as one can restrict the category of algebras of a monad to the Kleisli category, perhaps we can construct a "category of horizontal models of a theory" in a VDC and then restrict that to get something analogous to <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">H</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">K</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">l</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">e</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">i</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">s</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">l</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">i</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo></mrow><mi>T</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{HKleisli(}T)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">HKleisli</span><span class="mopen">(</span></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">T</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span>. Then you can simply take the Mod construction of that to get a generalized multicategory without having to worry about monads at all. But of course the main problem with this is that the monad-theory correspondence only works on <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">e</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{Set}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">Set</span></span></span></span></span> in the unenriched case, but I'm still confident there's a way to extend this correspondence that might help.</p>
<p>Anyways that's all my thoughts for today... I'll probably get back to talking about spaces but I think I might need to rest for a bit first!</p>

<p>I did some digging around in the literature and ended up finding a few authors who did define a notion of "preconvergence space".

<p>I would add them, except the concept described on the nLab article is different from the preconvergence spaces defined in the references. So I'm wondering if I should instead rename this current nLab article to something else and start a new article on the preconvergence spaces actually found in the literature. Especially since John Onstead pointed out that the current article's topic also generalises cluster spaces which are meant to formalise clustering rather than convergence.</p>

<p>I think a good name for the space currently described in the nLab article on <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/preconvergence%20spaces">[[preconvergence spaces]]</a> would be "generalised filter spaces" since they generalise all the spaces defined using filters.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://topology.nipissingu.ca/tp/reprints/v29/tp29216.pdf">Non-symmetric Convenient Topology and its Relation to Convenient Topology</a> the author Gerhard Preuss defines a "preconvergence space" to be this other structure: </p>

<li>a preconvergence space is a preuniform convergence space which is ‘generated’ by its preconvergent filters</li>

<p>I believe the "official" best thing to do is to raise the issue on the nForum and see if anyone objects, and then change the page title if nobody objects after a while.    I think it would be really good for you to join the nForum.  But if you don't want to, we could just ask <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276777">@Mike Shulman</span> what he thinks - he's like the local representative of the nForum here.</p>
<p>In the meantime the easiest thing to do is add the references prefaced by a sentence saying "For a different concept of preconvergence space, see..."  And maybe you could explain the difference.  This would take 5 minutes and nobody could possibly be offended.</p>

<p>It's quite possible nobody knows enough about this to care very much, but it's also the weekend now, so if nobody replies after - what, a week? a few days? - it's good to just go ahead and take action before you lose interest.  People can always change things back if they don't like what you did, but it's nice to see if anyone has opinions.</p>

<p>I wanted to return to discussing spaces from the discussing of VDCs by asking a question I've had for some time now. So when you have a virtual equipment like those for generalized multicategories, you can define category theoretic machinery for the objects in that equipment, such as (weighted) limits and colimits. But topological spaces (and, as we've seen, many other kinds of space) can be seen as generalized multicategories. That leaves me wondering: what is the notion of "limit" and/or "colimit" internal to the virtual equipment of topological spaces? Does it correspond with any traditional/standard topological concepts? Is it useful in any way?</p>

<p>Hmm... by any chance, have you ever considered revisiting the subject of generalized multicategories and writing up a "sequel" paper? Of course it wouldn't need to just be about pro-generalized multicategories. The "Unified Framework for Generalized Multicategories" came out all the way back in 2010. Since then, there have been a plethora of new concepts and developments that could be fit into, or help enhance, the framework. For instance, there's been a massive amount of further work in developing formal category theory, including in virtual equipments (such as what was covered in a recent double category seminar advertised on this server). There's also been other candidates for formal category theory settings, like augmented virtual double categories. We also have all the potential ways to expand the subject that we discussed right here above!</p>
<p>In my ideal world I'd of course very much like to do some of this myself. I have a lot of ideas for the subject of VDCs and generalized multicategories, and I'd like the opportunity to see for myself if they are actually useful or functional or not. Alas I'm no mathematician so I don't see that as something that can happen in the near future!</p>

<p>When it comes to functoriality, I'm wondering about the functoriality of the "pro" construction. It seems like it should be functorial since, as stated in the paper, there should be a "pro-VDC" for every VDC, and it also seems there's a natural way to lift a monad on a VDC to one on the pro-VDC. </p>
<p>But I also wonder... could the "pro" construction not just be one but a whole spectrum of different related constructions? For instance, the usual pro construction takes you from a category where morphisms are relations of a certain kind to a category where morphisms are directed sets of those relations. Might it be possible to come up with a "weaker" notion of "pro" construction that takes you to a category where morphisms are mere sets of the relations (rather than directed sets?)

<p>For a Lawvere theory T and a category C with finite products, Mod(T,C) is equivalently the category of finite-product-preserving functors from (the syntactic category of) T to C.  Therefore, Mod(T,-) is a representable functor whose domain is the (2-)category of categories with finite products <em>and finite-product-preserving functors</em>.  Thus, if a monad on Set preserves finite products, then you can apply this functor to it and obtain a monad on Mod(T,Set).</p>
<p>You can do the same thing for theories in other doctrines, and in each case the monad will have to preserve the relevant categorical structure in order to lift.</p>

<p>Ah, so that's the catch! Thanks, that makes sense! Especially since the more advanced the doctrine, the less functors will preserve that structure.<br>
But this provides at least somewhat of a systematic answer to if a monad will lift to some category, specifically a category of models- just look at what structure the monad preserves.</p>

<p>When I was looking at the article for prometric space to learn more about them, I stumbled upon <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/prometric+space#proarrows">this table</a> at the bottom which seems to summarize some of the <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>T</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>V</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">(T,V)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">T</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.22222em;">V</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span>-algebra concepts.

<p>I tried looking into it myself, but I ran into a problem- a topogeny is a binary relation, but it seems to be one between a powerset and itself. But we need a binary relation between some monad applied to a set and the set itself.</p>

<p>It is possible to generalize generalized multicategories to "generalized <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/polycategories">[[polycategories]]</a>", a.k.a. generalized <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/PROPs">[[PROPs]]</a>, where you have one monad for the domains of morphisms and a possibly-different monad for their codomains, related by a "horizontal distributive law".  But I don't know whether you can make proximity spaces come out of that.  (And I don't think anyone has yet written down a general theory of such things.)</p>

But any power of two is only divisible by two (or a lesser power of two), so unless the cardinality of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>X</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">X</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07847em;">X</span></span></span></span> is a power of two, we can't "divide" in this way (since the category of sets is the categorification of the natural numbers, not the rationals).

<p>But I have another solution to the problem! Consider the category <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">P</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">R</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">e</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">l</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{PRel}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6944em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">PRel</span></span></span></span></span> where objects are sets and the morphisms are <em>powerset</em> relations between the sets. Then a proximity space is easily a generalized multicategory for this category under the identity monad. (that is, if the category I described actually makes sense...)</p>

<p>So there's no treatment of generalized polycategories analogous to "A Unified Framework for Generalized Multicategories"? If not, at least there should be something in the works, right?</p>

<p>Here's my next question. In the nlab article "<a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/apartness+space#pointset_apartness_spaces">apartness space</a>", it states that an apartness space is given by a binary relation between the powerset and the set itself. However, in the book Monoidal Topology, as well as other sources (even including the generalized multicategories article), this is referred to as a "closure space". Maybe they're the same thing? But if they are, then why does the nlab article claim that apartness spaces don't generalize topological spaces? Topological spaces are a case of closure space for sure, since one can describe topological spaces via a closure operator satisfying all the Kuratowski closure axioms. So what's going on here?</p>

<p>Well the "Idea" section says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An apartness space is a set equipped with an “apartness relation” that distinguishes between pairs of points or sets. They are particularly interesting in constructive mathematics; in classical mathematics they <em>tend to be equivalent</em> to better-known definitions expressed in terms of “closeness” rather than “apartness”.

<p>It can't be more precise than that at that point because the page as a whole is about several different kinds of "apartness space".</p>

<p>The section on "point-set apartness spaces", which this question is about, gives the axioms, then contraposes them and says that those axioms</p>
<blockquote>
<p>are precisely the axioms of a topology expressed in terms of a closure operator. In constructive mathematics, of course, the law of contraposition does not hold.</p>

<p>But the lower section "Relation to topological spaces" could probably say more explicitly that the adjunction it discusses becomes an equivalence in classical mathematics.</p>

<p>I did more research on the category I proposed above, <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">P</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">R</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">e</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">l</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{PRel}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6944em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">PRel</span></span></span></span></span>. A type of category similar to this, and that also connects with distributivity conditions as mentioned, is a "double" Kleisli category. Given a monad <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>T</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">T</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">T</span></span></span></span> and comonad <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>C</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">C</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07153em;">C</span></span></span></span>, satisfying the distributivity conditions, this kind of category has as morphisms the morphisms <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>C</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>X</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>→</mo><mi>T</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>Y</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">C(X) \to T(Y)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07153em;">C</span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07847em;">X</span><span class="mclose">)</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">→</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">T</span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.22222em;">Y</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span> in the original category. This is close to what I want, but unfortunately it requires not two monads but a monad and a comonad, while the powerset monad is only a monad.</p>
<p>I tried to do something a little different next. First, I considered the category <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">R</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">e</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">l</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{Rel}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6944em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">Rel</span></span></span></span></span> and the powerset monad extended onto it <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>P</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">P</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">P</span></span></span></span>. But instead of finding its algebras, I applied the Kleisli category construction to get the category <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">K</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">l</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">e</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">i</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">s</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">l</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">i</mi></mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>P</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{Kleisli}(P)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">Kleisli</span></span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">P</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span>.

Here's my question: can you extend the powerset monad again to this Kleisli category? And if so, what would be an algebra for this monad- would it be of the form of a binary relation <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>P</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>X</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>→</mo><mi>P</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>X</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">P(X) \to P(X)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">P</span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07847em;">X</span><span class="mclose">)</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">→</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">P</span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07847em;">X</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span>?</p>

<p>I don't know about that last question.  But re: the first paragraph, this is why I think the proper setting for generalized polycategories is a pair of "vertical" monads (not a monad and a comonad) on a VDC, together with a <em>horizontal</em> distributive law between them.  That should suffice to define a horizontal double-Kleisli VDC.  The connection with the monad/comonad picture is that in an equipment, with both companions and conjoints, a vertical monad induces both a horizontal monad and a horizontal comonad, by taking companions or conjoints respectively.</p>

<p>I covered most of the kinds of space I wanted to cover (IE, the topological-esque spaces), so now I want to situate this discussion in terms of the larger concept of "locality". In summary, it seems that from the perspective of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>T</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>V</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">(T,V)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">T</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.22222em;">V</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span>-algebras, a "topological-esque space" is a set equipped with some set of "parts" of the space (whether it be subsets via the powerset monad, filters via the filter monad, ultrafilters via the ultrafilter monad, etc.) and relations involving these parts (that can be either binary or valued in some more general quantale) that "quantify" how "close" (or "apart") the parts of the set are to each other. As we've seen I think this covers most if not all examples of such spaces.</p>
<p>But being "topological-esque" isn't the only notion of "locality" in math. For instance, there are kinds of space with a "higher order" of locality- most notably manifolds and "manifold-esque spaces". So my question here is: how does the approach to locality given by the above summary connect to the bigger picture of locality in general, and more specifically to the example of manifolds? For instance, is there a way to express a manifold (doesn't matter which type, could be topological, differentiable, smooth, etc.) directly as a <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>T</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>V</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">(T,V)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">T</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.22222em;">V</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span>-algebra, or if not directly, is there at least some connection that can be made?</p>

<p>Could you expand on that? At least, tell me what is fundamentally different between the "locality" encapsulated by topological-esque spaces and "locality" as encapsulated by manifolds. If these are two separate constructions, why would we say that both have a notion of "locality"- whatever that means?

<p>I think a lot of different answers could be given to that question.  The one that occurs to me right now is that "topological-esque" spaces have a way to measure "how far apart" things are (where the "things" could be points, subsets, filters, etc. and the "measurement" could be with real numbers, filters, truth values, etc.) whereas manifold-esque spaces are built by gluing together "local models" (which could be parts of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi mathvariant="double-struck">R</mi><mi>n</mi></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{R}^n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6889em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathbb">R</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.6644em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mathnormal mtight">n</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>, parts of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi mathvariant="double-struck">C</mi><mi>n</mi></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{C}^n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6889em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathbb">C</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.6644em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mathnormal mtight">n</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>, spectra of rings, etc.).</p>

<p>That makes sense! So I guess if there was a common theme, it would be relating "parts" together, whether it be by measuring how "far apart" they are, or by gluing them together.</p>

<p>Though that does make me wonder if gluing itself can be expressed as some sort of binary relation. For instance, let's say you have <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">O</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">p</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">e</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">n</mi></mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msup><mi mathvariant="double-struck">R</mi><mi>n</mi></msup><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{Open}(\mathbb{R}^n)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">Open</span></span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathbb">R</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.6644em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mathnormal mtight">n</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span>, the set of open subsets of Euclidean space. What if you then imposed a binary relation on this set that describes "overlap"- that is, two open subsets of Euclidean space are paired with each other under this binary relation if they are meant to "overlap" with one another, perhaps in the context of using these open subsets to build up some manifold. Then the "gluing" can be encapsulated by imposing some axioms on this binary relation. Have you encountered such an "overlap" relation before, and how close would such a thing be to describing an actual manifold?</p>

<p>It's not just a relation on the set <em>of</em> open subsets, since you have to specify exactly <em>how</em> two opens overlap.  So really it's a relation between each pair of open subsets themselves.  If you make this precise you get a notion of "many-object relation" or "many-object congruence", and manifolds can indeed be described in terms of such things.  We discussed this here a couple of months ago in the thread about <a href="#narrow/channel/229199-learning.3A-questions/topic/motivating.20.22sites.22/near/472957483">motivating sites</a>.

<p>I see... that topic and paper was actually something I wanted to go into more detail on, since it relates back to another concept I'm trying to understand, that of sheaves. It might be something I'd like to discuss in the near future, though I'll be sure to check this out before then!</p>

<p>Well, you can define generalized multicategories for any monad on any VDC.  So it could be the VDC of posets and profunctors, if you happen to have a monad there.</p>
