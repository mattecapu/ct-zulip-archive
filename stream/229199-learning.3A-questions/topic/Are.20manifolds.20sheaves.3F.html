<p>Possibly basic question, I feel like I should have asked this ages ago, but somehow I never did. <br>
Is a manifold (or at least an atlas) a sheaf or a stack of <em>something</em>? It's all about gluing local data. But unlike, say <em>sections of a bundle</em> on a manifold, I can't quite see how to make the sheaf structure precise. </p>
<p>(Of course it's a representable presheaf in the category of manifolds, but is there something less trivial that one can say? Or does the atlas at least play a special role in making the descent condition explicit?)</p>

<p>In short, yes, a manifold is a sheaf on the site of (open subsets of) Cartesian spaces and smooth maps between them, with the Grothendieck topology described <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/CartSp#as_a_site">here</a>. More generally, any smooth manifold, Frechet manifold, and diffeological space is an example of a <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/smooth+set">smooth set</a>, and smooth sets are precisely the sheaves on this site of Cartesian spaces and smooth maps. You can think of a smooth set as "gluing together" copies of Euclidean space with smooth structure. </p>
<p>Even more particularly, the category of smooth manifolds is the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Karoubi+envelope#the_category_of_smooth_manifolds">Cauchy completion</a> of the category of open subsets of Cartesian space and smooth maps between them. That defines precisely the subcategory of smooth sets on the manifolds.</p>

<p>Mmh, I think that is witnessed by John's argument. The category of sheaves has, e.g., pushouts, but manifolds do not. For instance, gluing together two distinct manifolds of different dimensions does not yield a manifold (e.g. a lollipop).</p>

<p>The category of smooth manifolds is fully and faithfully embedded in that category of sheaves, so a smooth manifold can be seen one of these sheaves with an extra property.   So, the question is just how nicely one can state that extra property.   I don't have anything intelligent to say about that.</p>

<p>One has to start with saying that the category of manifolds is a full subcategory of that of concrete sheaves on Cart, aka diffeological spaces. Because lots of sheaves have too few (generalised) points, for instance the sheaf of n-forms, which has one point, one curve, one .... and then an infinite-dimensional space of n-dimensional plots.</p>

<p>You can say a manifold is a sheaf on cartesian spaces together with an atlas: a jointly epi out of representables that is also representable (i.e., base changing to any representable gives an arrow in the image of Yoneda) and a submersion (after base changing to a representable it's a submersion). </p>
<p>The same thing holds for schemes, analytic spaces etc.</p>

<p>Yes, I was thinking about how to phrase something like that, and I'm so used to having coproducts in the site, that I got stuck on thinking that you can't get a single map from a representable to the sheaf!</p>

<p>Yes. Good point. That’s the correct definition. When I wrote that, I was thinking about a smooth atlas, which should again yield a manifold (because the quotient by an eq relation such that one leg, equivalently both, is a submersion is again a manifold). </p>
<p>For the other instances I'd mentioned, you usually will want affine open immersions. In general, you will want the your atlas to output an equivalence relation such that each leg is a covering (over its image) with respect to your chosen topology.</p>
<p>Btw, that’s something curious I'd never thought about before. It seems, for 0-truncated guys, smooth and étale atlases are the same (in all the instances I can remember), but, when we go higher and consider non 0-truncated guys, we usually have two non-equivalent choices of atlases. Is that perhaps a general fact for any geometry (in the sense of structured topos theory)? (What's even a smooth map in the Zariski topology?)</p>

<p>The claim is that adding projections to a site of open covers gives an equivalent sites. Maybe adding projections to the site of open covers can be viewed as giving a site of smooth covers?</p>

<p>(I think at some point it has to be pointed out that to get the classical notion of manifold we also have to add a separation condition, since manifolds are supposed to be Hausdorff.)</p>

<p>You can say a manifold is a sheaf on cartesian spaces together with an atlas: a jointly epi out of representables that is also representable (i.e., base changing to any representable gives an arrow in the image of Yoneda) and a submersion (after base changing to a representable it's a submersion). </p>
<p>The same thing holds for schemes, analytic spaces etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can't we even require the cover to be representably étale (local diffeomorphism) rather than a submersion? In my intuition, that's what captures the idea of an open cover of affines.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. Good point. That’s the correct definition. When I wrote that, I was thinking about a smooth atlas, which should again yield a manifold[...].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmm...Now I see that the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/CartSp">nlab seems to define the covering sieves on cartesian spaces</a> to be jointly surjective open immersions with intersections diffeomorphic to cartesian spaces. That’s even more than étale. So the actually correct definition of an atlas is even more strict.</p>
<p>However, I think both sites (étale and those open immersions) should yield the same topos, but I'm not sure: can every jointly surjective family of  euclidean opens be refined to another one where each n-ary intersection is diffeomorphic to an euclidean space?</p>

<p>Nevermind. I've just checked it. That seems to give the correct definition only when the local models are euclidean spaces if I'm not missing anything. [Lurie's definition of smoothness](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/geometry+(for+structured+(infinity%2C1%29-toposes%29#smooth_morphisms)  gives the usual def of smoothness in the étale topology, but I don’t know what happens for anything else.</p>

[Lurie's definition of smoothness](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/geometry+(for+structured+(infinity%2C1%29-toposes%29#smooth_morphisms)  gives the usual def of smoothness in the étale topology, but I don’t know what happens for anything else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His smoothness definition depends on a pre-geometry and neither a geometry nor a pre-geom determines the other uniquely. So my question was perhaps not that interesting.</p>
<p>If one chooses the correct pre-geometry (say, compact free algebras if we are talking about an essentially algebraic theory), smoothness is kind of obvious: smooth with respect to some topology means locally isomorphic to the dual of a compact free algebra. So, in particular, a Zariski-smooth atlas of a 0-truncated object, will just give a groupoid scheme with smooth legs, which seems very different from a scheme...</p>
<p>Also, that's even worse: I'm starting to think my initial statement was wrong. In smooth sets, from a smooth (aka submersive) atlas, I can only get a groupoid with smooth legs. I can't remember why I thought the underlying relation was also representable... perhaps it's not?... </p>
<p>Anyways, I'm too sleepy to figure that out now.</p>

<p>Just clarifying my own confusion from yesterday.</p>
<p>I somehow forgot that the site is a 1-cat, so every representable is 0-truncated. In particular, the groupoid induced from an atlas of some 0-truncated object will always be a relation with smooth legs. Still, the map <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>R</mi><mo>→</mo><mi>X</mi><mo>×</mo><mi>X</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">R \to X \times X</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.00773em;">R</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">→</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.7667em;vertical-align:-0.0833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07847em;">X</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span><span class="mbin">×</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07847em;">X</span></span></span></span> is only a mono, so there's no reason for that to define a submanifold. Then, Godement's criterion cannot be used.</p>

<p>In the general setting of an essentially algebraic theories with a topology and the respective pre-geometries of compact algebras that are locally (in the chosen topology) compact free algebras, I

<p>However, for schemes in the étale topology, the analogous statement is true: <a href="https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/04SZ">every 0-truncated algebraic stack is an algebraic space</a>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nah. The proof on Stacks Project relies really on fppf-locality. It doesn't imply the result for the étale topology. It just says that fppf-locally (not necessarily étale-locally) one can construct an étale relation. So I don't even know whether a 0-truncated algebraic stack  is an algebraic space in the étale topology.</p>

<p>There is another way to look at manifolds as sheaves: the category of smooth manifolds (not necessarily paracompact or Hausdorff) and etale smooth maps (i.e., local diffeomorphisms) is equivalent to the category of sheaves of sets on the site of cartesian spaces, etale smooth maps, and jointly surjective families as covering families.  In particular, the category of manifolds and etale maps is a Grothendieck topos, so admits all small limits, small colimits, and is cartesian closed (and locally cartesian closed).  Colimits coincide with colimits in the other categories (e.g., sheaves of sets on manifolds and smooth maps), whereas limits and internal homs are quite different.  The inclusion functor from cartesian spaces and etale maps to cartesian spaces and smooth maps induces a left adjoint functor between the corresponding categories of sheaves of sets.  The image of this functor can be characterized as the category of manifolds and etale maps, sitting inside the much larger category of smooth sets and smooth maps.  Abstractly, this describes what is now called a fractured ∞-topos, a theory developed by Joyal–Moerdijk, Dubuc, Carchedi, Lurie.</p>

<p>This can't be true: product projections are not étale. The category of manifolds and étale maps doesn't have a terminal object.</p>

<p>Products in the topos of sheaves on cartesian spaces and etale maps are quite different from the usual products of manifolds, so there is no problem there.  The problem with the terminal object is eliminated by taking the appropriate full subcategory of sheaves, as is now done in the corrected post.  (As pointed out by Adrian below, one has to be careful which version of 0-truncated objects to select: a 0-truncated sheaf on the etale site need not remain 0-truncated on the cartesian site, and we need the latter, not the former.)</p>
