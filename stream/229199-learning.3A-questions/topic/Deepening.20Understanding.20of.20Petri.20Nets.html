<p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>I have been exposed to petri nets in the past and had read only a little about them here and there. Thanks to a wonderful conversation with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="280755">@Owen Lynch</span> last week, I have been exploring petri nets again but was wondering where might be the best places to learn about petri nets, there relationship to category theory, and CT applications of the structures (I have encountered most applications within the works of Baez, Libkind, and Fairbanks as of now -- wondering what else I have missed). </p>
<p>Would anyone be able to recommend some readings on petri nets? Thanks! </p>
<p>~ jz</p>

<p>You might try the paper "Categories of nets" by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276777">@Mike Shulman</span>, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="679887">@Fabrizio Romano Genovese</span>, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276037">@Jade Master</span> and myself.  The point is that different people use different kinds of Petri net, which can be confusing.  We sort them out using category theory in a nice way: different kinds of Petri nets are presentations of different kinds of symmetric monoidal categories.  I recommend starting with <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2021/01/categories_of_nets_part_1.html">my blog article</a> on this paper, and then reading <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2021/01/categories_of_nets_part_2.html">Mike's blog article</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks, Owen!  Yes, this is my book on Petri nets with Jacob Biamonte, which is a fun place to learn about many aspects of Petri nets.  (How many math books have a picture of a rabbit warrior?)  But for some reason I misread Jacob's question and thought he <em>only</em> wanted to learn about the category-theoretic aspects of Petri nets.  Now I see he may be interested in more.</p>

<p>That said, I have been reading through the resources you suggested (starting the with the blog posts on <em>Categories of Nets</em>) and have been enjoying the materials so far. </p>
<p>An initial question I had is based on these lines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A Petri net is actually a way of describing a monoidal category. A way of putting a bunch of tokens in the places gives an&nbsp;<em>object</em>&nbsp;of this category, and a way of moving them around repeatedly (as above) gives a&nbsp;<em>morphism</em>.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Particularly, that moving the tokens in the places gives an object of the monoidal category. Later in the post, it says that petri nets are "rigidly collectivist" but this feels slightly contradictory to me based on the photo provided in the blog post here: <br>
<a href="/user_uploads/21317/pn8RcZBMULSNhlNqzbR8T39U/image.png">image.png</a></p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/21317/pn8RcZBMULSNhlNqzbR8T39U/image.png" title="image.png"><img data-original-dimensions="939x201" src="/user_uploads/thumbnail/21317/pn8RcZBMULSNhlNqzbR8T39U/image.png/840x560.webp"></a></div><p>My understanding is that the three orientations of the tokens in the single petri net each represent objects of the monoidal category (I am ignoring how morphisms were defined for now). How are petri nets "rigidly collectivist" when it seems like the location of the tokens in each "place" gives rise to objects in this category? To me, it seems like we would say that there is only ever three tokens in this petri net which would imply one object given the "rigidly collectivist" rules to generate an object in the monoidal category.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i.e. based on this statement: "<em>In the so-called &lsquo;individual token philosophy&rsquo;, we allow a finite set of tokens in each place. In the &lsquo;collective token philosophy&rsquo;, we merely allow a natural number of tokens in each place. It&rsquo;s like the difference between having 4 individual workers named John, Fabrizio, Jade and Mike where you can tell who did what, and having 4 anonymous workers: nameless drones.</em>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This would be one of the first things explained in a typical introduction to Petri nets, since this is what Petri nets are all about.   Actually if you look carefully at the picture you can figure out what's going on.  Notice how in the first step, two token move into the top left box and one pops out, moving into the circle at right.</p>

<p>If you want to learn these definitions my book may not be best, because it starts by explaining applications of Petri nets to chemistry, which go in a somewhat different direction.  A more traditional computer-science oriented introduction may be better, though unfortunately I've never seen one I enjoy.</p>

<p>I decided to delete that because there's no point in discussing this rather subtle issue until you've learned basic Petri net concepts like place, transition, token, marking, the firing of a transition, and how the marking changes when you fire a transition.    </p>
<p>(Right now you are staring at three markings of the same Petri net, and trying to figure out how the marking changes when a transition fires.)</p>

<p>Alright, I took a look further at the markings. So it seems like in marking 1, this is the "initial state" of the marking with tokens placed in each place (representing the initial conditions of the petri net). In marking 2, the arcs into the "top" transition block (I am denoting the "top" transition as the transition at the top of the marking; "bottom" transition analogously so) seem to combine their places' tokens into one token that gets put into the far right place. In marking 3, it seems like one token is "sent" from that far right place into the "bottom" transition which splits the token into two tokens that get placed in the bottom place.</p>

<p>So, from that, it appears that petri nets have two types of transitions which operate on tokens to combine or split them. It seems that the transition that "combines" can have however many number of arcs going into it but with only one arc going out from it. The "splitter" transition seems to accept one arc, but then can split an incoming token into as many tokens going out of the "splitter" transition as there are arcs.</p>

<p>You're exactly right as far as this example goes.  But this example is special in that all the transitions either have 2 input arcs and 1 output arc, or 1 output arc and 2 input arcs.   Petri nets can be more general.</p>
<p>In general, a transition can have m input arcs and n output arcs.   When that transition fires, one token leaves each of the places connected to that transition by input arcs, and one token goes into each of the places connected to that transition by output arcs.</p>

<p>But I wouldn't use the term 'causes'.   A transition doesn't <em>need</em> to fire when there are enough tokens in the right places.  It's just <em>able</em> to fire.</p>

<p>Now that you know the rules for when transitions can fire and what happens when they fire, you can figure this out and test your understanding.   Can this Petri net keep firing forever, or must it stop now, or must it stop at some later point?</p>

<p>Ok, I think I am getting somewhere! With your question back to me about my pondering on if the petri net continues to send tokens around forever, using the rules and discussion from here, I have concluded that no, it would not continue forever and it does not necessarily needs to stop now. At marking 3, it is clear that the top transition does not have enough tokens to fire again. </p>
<p>However, the bottom transition does have "enough" tokens to fire again. So if the bottom transition were to fire again, we would have a final marking, marking 4, where there are now four tokens in the bottom place. And at that point, the petri net would "stop" as the transitions can no longer fire.</p>

<p>Alright, so before I jump back to earlier questions about the category theoretic relationship to petri nets (as well as language usages), could you help me better understand this notion of "firing"? It's curious as it seems firing happens sequentially rather than simultaneously (based on the existence of marking 2). As you were saying, "cause" is a rather loaded term to use, but in this case, what triggers a transition to fire? Is that <em>I</em> want it to fire or is it due to some system property?</p>

<p>There are many semantics for Petri nets, so no single answer as to "why" a transition fires.  Computer scientists use a "nondeterministic" semantics, which I would call a "possibilistic" semantics.  This means all we know is whether it's <em>possible</em> for a transition to fire - and I've already explained when it's possible.  All we can say is whether a sequence of firings is <em>possible</em>.</p>

<p>If you read my book you'll learn about the "master equation" for Petri nets.  This describes a "probabilistic" or "stochastic" semantics.  Here we attach a number called a <strong>rate constant</strong> to each transition.  This allows us - via a complicated formula I explain - to compute a <em>probability per time</em> for a transition to fire.</p>

<p>The "nondeterministic" semantics is simpler.  In that semantics, asking "why a transition fires" is exactly like asking "why a morphism happens" in a category - it's a question that doesn't make sense.</p>

<p>As you have gotten me thinking more correctly on the basics of petri nets, if it is alright, I wanted to jump back to the higher abstraction of how petri nets are understood in categorical framing. As the blog post noted, each of these markings in this specific petri net (which, as you mentioned, is just an example) give rise to objects that exist within a monoidal category. What I am not clear is how exactly the morphisms in such a category are defined. I know you say in the blog post that:</p>

<p>So are the morphisms defined as a map from marking to marking that records the position of tokens within each place (which I think follows the "individualist" tradition you mentioned)? Or how would I want to understand the morphisms? I am having trouble seeing what is the data associated with the morphisms in this small example category.</p>

<p>Then, for a lot of details about 3 variations on this theme, see the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04238">Categories of nets</a>.  We describe 3 kinds of Petri-net-like things, and how they generate</p>
<ul>
<li>monoidal categories</li>
<li>strict symmetric monoidal categories</li>
<li>commutative monoidal categories</li>
</ul>
<p>By the way, plain old Petri nets - of the sort we've been discussing - generate commutative monoidal categories!   Here the collective token philosophy reigns supreme, as the word "commutative" should indicate: switching two tokens does absolutely <em>nothing</em>.</p>

<p>Another way of thinking about Petri net firing is that a Petri net can be seen as an <em>open</em> discrete dynamical system, i.e. a dependent Moore machine. Written in polynomial notation, we have an interface:</p>

<p>This is _the_ interpretation. Indeed the categories associated to Petri nets (depending on semantics) are not just monoidal but free monoidal. In this respect, a Petri net represents the most general abstraction of what a "system that can be represented as monoidal categories" is.</p>

<p>That's a very good way to put it, Fabrizio.  But for the nonexperts out there: wherever Fabrizio said "monoidal" we should say "commutative monoidal" if we're talking about plain old Petri nets, as we've been doing in this thread.  But <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2021/01/categories_of_nets_part_1.html">our paper</a> discusses variants of the concept of Petri net that let you replace "commutative monoidal" with "symmetric monoidal" or simply "monoidal".</p>

<p>As John has already pointed out, there are different ways of composing  Petri nets: in some of the papers cited here, nets are glued along places, while <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.0204">in other work</a> they are glued along transitions. And the form of composition makes a big difference if the idea is to obtain a functorial account of Petri nets behaviour---by that, I mean a (symmetric monoidal) functor between a category which hosts the syntax of nets as combinatorial objects,  and another category in which they take their semantics. This is what is sometimes referred to as <em>compositionality</em> in this context. </p>
<p>I and several others have worked on the algebra of nets composed along transitions, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3290338">giving them a presentation</a> as a symmetric monoidal theory, with generators and relations.  While it was interesting work, connected to other seemingly unrelated formalisms, like signal flow graphs for linear dynamical systems, our presentation only gave an account of the one-step behaviour of a given net, that is, how the number of tokens in its places can change from firing (potentially multiple simultaneous) transitions once. This does not tackle what researchers in the field really care about, namely which configurations can be reached from which (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_net#Reachability">reachability</a>, a problem whose complexity was pinned down fairly recently) or useful related questions (like <em>coverability</em>, for example). It would have been great to gain some insight into these complicated problems using the algebraic tools we have developed, but I was unable to achieve anything substantial at the time, and have not gone back to them since. (And this is where some of the real challenges of <em>applied</em> category theory discussed here in another thread became apparent to me.)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>What do you mean by a category hosting the syntax of nets as combinatorial objects? Is this referring to markings?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here by "syntax" I mean a combinatorial description of a Petri net---basically, just a (directed) hypergraph! Of course, to turn these into "open" Petri nets and organise them into a category, we usually consider some sort of cospan of hypergraph, whose legs indicate which of the places/transition - there is a choice, as I said above - are available to be composed with the environment. </p>
<p>But, this is just syntax, in the sense that it tells us almost nothing about why we usually care about Petri nets: they are systems whose combinatorial description specifies which transitions can be fired in what state (i.e. tokens in some places). This is their semantics. There are also several possible interpretations here, but this is the general idea. And often, you can organise these semantics into a (symmetric monoidal) category too. For example, for the usual interpretation of plain Petri nets, this category is simply the category of sets and relations. For nets with rates who fire in continuous time, see the work of John and his coauthors. Then, when we're lucky, there is a (symmetric monoidal) functor from the syntax to the semantics, which guarantees that the interpretation is compositional, aka "black-boxing" as John calls it above. </p>
<p>However, as I said, this only holds, as far as I'm aware, for the one-step behaviour of the net; more interesting and complicated properties like the reachability relation (which is just the transition closure of the former) do not usually give such a functor. Studying when symmetric monoidal functoriality break down might provide some insight into why some of these other properties are more complex to compute btw.</p>

<p>My final outstanding question at the moment is where is the best place to start? </p>
<p>To me, the two blog posts seem nice to get a super high level overview of the material here (so that seems like a nice starting point to seed initial questions). The book seems the most authoritative so I'd proceed to that. The papers seem like the would be a strong complement to the book but I am not too clear.</p>
<p>So my thought is:</p>
<p>Blog posts -&gt; Book -&gt; Papers</p>
<p>Does that seem reasonable?</p>

<p>It really depends on what you're interested in, Jacob.  </p>
<p>Blog posts are easier to read than my book (simply because the book is big), which is easier to read than research papers (since those are less expository in nature).   But my book covers many topics that aren't in the papers, including a lot of topics that have nothing to do with Petri nets.  Conversely, the research papers cover a lot of topics that aren't in the book.</p>
<p>The book is about quantum techniques in stochastic mechanics, and I imagine Owen likes it in part because he already knew quantum mechanics.</p>

<p>Personally, instead of trying to plan things out ahead of time, I'd try reading something and see if I understand and enjoy it.   Then if not I'd switch to something else.</p>

<p>And that will be the tack I set my sails to! Thanks for all the thoughts and guidance <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span> (and everyone else)! I am going to start with your book (discussion in <a class="stream-topic" data-stream-id="232160" href="/#narrow/stream/232160-learning.3A-reading-.26-references/topic/Quantum.20Techniques.20for.20Stochastic.20Mechanics">#learning: reading &amp; references &gt; Quantum Techniques for Stochastic Mechanics</a> now) as to address what I am most interested in, which is: how one can model on top of petri nets a public health study and what might a categorical treatment of these petri nets in this context give rise to for future study.</p>

<p>Sounds great!   I look forward to it.  By the way, I know just one paper using category theory and Petri nets to develop software for public health:</p>
