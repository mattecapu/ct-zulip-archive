<p>So I had this idea, that we could start with a category, and choose subsets of morphisms from each of its homsets.</p>
<p>In general this collection of subsets won't be a category, but there is at least one category that contains them, the one we started with.</p>
<p>But there could be lots of other subcategories containing our chosen collection of subsets.</p>
<p>Intuitively it seems to me there should be a smallest one of these, the one that contains all of the compositions of morphisms from our subsets.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/subcategory">[[subcategory]]</a> emphasizes that one should approach such constructions with care, because you have to think about the principle of equivalence.</p>
<p>It seems like my intuition can be made to work, but there are steps along the way to making that happen, do folks have advice on how to use the above intuition to define the subcategory generated by a given collection of subsets of a category?</p>

<p>You don't <em>have</em> to think about the principle of equivalence, it's just often a good idea. There aren't any police empowered to write you tickets for this kind of thing! If you don't worry about that, then, yeah, you just take the intersection of all the subcategories containing all your chosen arrows to get the smallest one you want. This kind of "intersection of a big set of subsets which I know is nonempty" procedure is a very common way to construct closures.</p>

<p>If you <em>do</em> want, or need, to think about the principle of equivalence, then the first question to ask is what notion of "subcategory" you mean, since the very notion of non-full subcategory is not equivalence-invariant.  What examples do you have in mind?</p>

<p>I guess for what I'm trying to understand, is say I want to "master" a given category <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>C</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">C</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07153em;">C</span></span></span></span>, maybe I'm trying to learn all the symmetries of some object or something.</p>
<p>I'll get used to some arrows of the category <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>C</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">C</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07153em;">C</span></span></span></span> first.</p>
<p>Now, assuming I can comfortably compose these "basic arrows", what subcategory describes the morphisms I can make given the morphisms I've learned so far.</p>
<p>So if I have an Octogon, and I learn I can rotate it once, "I can now perform" any cyclic symmetry in <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>C</mi><mn>8</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">C^8</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8141em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07153em;">C</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.8141em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">8</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>. If I am able to perform <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">{</mo><mi>r</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>f</mi><mo stretchy="false">}</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\{r, f\}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">{</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.02778em;">r</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.10764em;">f</span><span class="mclose">}</span></span></span></span>, so I'm able to rotate and flip, then I get the entire group and I'm done, I've "mastered the group".</p>
<p>So I guess the technical problem I'm solving is, "How do I know when a collection of morphisms of a category generate the entire category?", and one way to know is "Well I know I haven't succeeded if the closure of the subset of arrows of the category is 'too small'".</p>
<p>I think equivalence is worth thinking about here, because a would be subcategory can actually be equivalent to the whole category. That will usually happen in a contractible groupoid for example. In this case it's fair to say "if you are familiar with one of the objects of a groupoid, you're familiar with all of them". </p>
<p>It's like how there's an infinite number of ways to define a product, but once we've established there's only a contractible groupoids worth of them, we don't need to stress ourselves out getting familiar with all of them.</p>

<p>This is such a sharp distinction, I feel like in trying to answer the first part, I would naturally try to prove an inclusion is an equivalence. So now I'm not sure if I know whether I'm getting excited about the right stuff.</p>
<p>Making a temporary aside to my "category for drawing" thread - one idea I had for a "category of lines", was to note the Moore-path category was already a category, and then I could specify a subset of continuous paths I know a person can draw. Then I could ask "which lines do I get after I take the closure of such a family of lines?"</p>
<p>Practically speaking, I think <em>that</em> problem has been mostly solved with presentations, but I realized I was initially thinking about this by trying to take closures of morphisms.</p>
<p>So coming back to this thread, maybe I can take a big step back and ask, what do you think would be a good example of taking closures without thinking about equivalence? And what would be a good example of when thinking about equivalence is important when taking closures? Are these commonly related with presentations of categories?</p>
<p>My goal here for this thread is to ground my understanding of this operation irrespective of how my intuition got there (I really thought I asked a focused enough question, I hope this context helps).</p>

<p>I don't see why the example you already gave involves thinking about equivalence. With the ideas your thoughts are calling up in my mind right now, I wouldn't be thinking about the principle of equivalence in any case. After all, if a subcategory's inclusion is an equivalence, then if you would just change it to span all the objects, you'd have the whole category. (That is, wide full subcategories are the whole category.) So I wouldn't really think this question would arise very naturally.</p>

<p>Maybe it's a mix of getting distracted by the nlab article before I'm ready, and genuine curiousity about what equivalence preserves.</p>
<p>It seems like when I understand equivalence a little bit better, it's like looking behind a veil and seeing a deeper reality behind overtly concrete patterns.</p>
<p>Subcategories just seemed to me like a good excuse to bring up equivalence is all. If I'm getting ahead of myself that's good to know.</p>

<p>Before getting into subtler issues, do you see how to prove the fact that given a category C and any set S of morphisms in C, the following three subcategories of C are equal:</p>
<p>1) the intersection of all subcategories of C whose setbof mophisms contains S</p>
<p>2) the smallest subcategory of C containing all the morphisms in S</p>
<p>3) the category whose objects are those objects that are sources and targets of morphisms in S, and whose morphisms are composites of morphisms in S (any finite number of morphisms in S, including 0, which needs to be handled carefully).</p>

<p>All the identities are contained by <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">⟨</mo><mi>S</mi><mo stretchy="false">⟩</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\langle S\rangle</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">⟨</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05764em;">S</span><span class="mclose">⟩</span></span></span></span>, and any finite list of arrows in <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>S</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">S</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05764em;">S</span></span></span></span>, are in every category containing <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>S</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">S</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05764em;">S</span></span></span></span>, and therefore their composition is in any category which contains <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>S</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">S</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05764em;">S</span></span></span></span> and therefore is an arrow of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">⟨</mo><mi>S</mi><mo stretchy="false">⟩</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\langle S\rangle</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">⟨</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05764em;">S</span><span class="mclose">⟩</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>So we do have <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">⟨</mo><mi>S</mi><msup><mo stretchy="false">⟩</mo><mo mathvariant="normal" lspace="0em" rspace="0em">′</mo></msup><mo>⊂</mo><mo stretchy="false">⟨</mo><mi>S</mi><mo stretchy="false">⟩</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\langle S\rangle&#x27; \subset \langle S\rangle</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1.0019em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">⟨</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05764em;">S</span><span class="mclose"><span class="mclose">⟩</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.7519em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mtight">′</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">⊂</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">⟨</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05764em;">S</span><span class="mclose">⟩</span></span></span></span> so I'm willing to now drop the <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mrow></mrow><mo mathvariant="normal" lspace="0em" rspace="0em">′</mo></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">&#x27;</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.7519em;"></span><span class="mord"><span></span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.7519em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mtight">′</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> and just write <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">⟨</mo><mi>S</mi><mo stretchy="false">⟩</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\langle S\rangle</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">⟨</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05764em;">S</span><span class="mclose">⟩</span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>You didn't ask for this, but I want to tie this together with presentations, because I've been thinking about those a lot, and they seem important here as well (or I'm at least confusing them with this concept).</p>
<p>The subset <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>S</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">S</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05764em;">S</span></span></span></span> has an underlying graph, you can freely generate a category on this graph. Now, there is a Functor from this free category into <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>C</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">C</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07153em;">C</span></span></span></span> that takes the generators to the arrows that inspired them from <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>S</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">S</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05764em;">S</span></span></span></span>. Now our freely generated category factors through the inclusion of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">⟨</mo><mi>S</mi><mo stretchy="false">⟩</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\langle S\rangle</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">⟨</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05764em;">S</span><span class="mclose">⟩</span></span></span></span> into <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>C</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">C</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07153em;">C</span></span></span></span>.</p>
