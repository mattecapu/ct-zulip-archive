<p>A (colored) prop is called "representable" when each list of objects in the prop is isomorphic to a single object.</p>
<p>It seems to me most people who like props are aware of the fact that representable props are equivalent to symmetric monoidal categories.</p>
<p>This appears as Theorem 2.3 in Mike Shulman's <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00818">A practical type theory for symmetric monoidal categories</a> . This paper is the only reference I know for this fantastic result or any result like it. Does anyone know the history of analogous theorems about the equivalence between representable prop-like structures and weak 2-categorical structures?</p>
<p>For similar reasons, it seems monoidal categories are equivalent to representable pros.<br>
Likewise, it seems bicategories are equivalent to representable "pros with colored regions".</p>
<p>What about double categories?<br>
Consider a structure X defined by the analogy <em>monoidal category : pro :: double category : X</em>. This structure X is like a double category, except its 1-cells cannot compose (neither vertically nor horizontally), and its 2-cells are bordered by pasting diagrams of 1-cells rather than single 1-cells.</p>
<p>Are doubly weak double categories equivalent to Xs that are both vertically and horizontally representable? Is this a good way to first wrap my head around doubly weak double categories?</p>

<p>Hermida's <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001870899918777">Representable multicategories</a> is the standard reference for the general setup, there instantiated for the equivalence between monoidal categories and representable multicategories. But the idea is already present in Cockett and Seely's papers on linearly distributive categories (equivalent to polycategories “representable on both sides”). There is also a version “with coloured regions”: <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/linear+bicategory">linear bicategories</a> are equivalent to representable <a href="http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/11/2/11-02abs.html">poly-bicategories</a></p>
<p>For people who are acquainted with this branch of “Canadian” category theory, I think the result about pros and props are mostly understood as degenerate versions of the result for polycategories: if a representable polycategory extends to a prop, then the “tensor” and “par” of the corresponding linearly distributive category collapse to a single operation, so the linearly distributive category is “actually” a monoidal category. </p>
<p>I think this fact -- that the “representable prop” result is a “degenerate case” of a more refined result about polycategories -- may be why the prop result is hard to find in publications (I have also only seen it spelled out in Shulman's paper that you cite).</p>

<p>More troublingly, the relevance of this result to the theory of string diagrams seems to be little known in the string diagram community, which has led to parts of it being “rediscovered” over and over... I am actually writing an expository paper for this purpose.</p>

<p>Ah, thank you for all this!</p>
<p>I agree, I see this as a very useful result. I've specifically gotten a lot of mileage out of thinking of 2-categorical structures as representable "many-in, many-out" prop-like structures (more than multicategory-like structures) because representability is so neatly described in terms of existence of isomorphisms within the structure.</p>
<p>Good luck with your expository paper!</p>

<p>There is an extra subtlety in that not every "arrangement of rectangles" is actually composable in a double category: as shown by <a href="http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/1995/n7/1-07abs.html">Dawson</a> there are "pinwheel" shapes that can't be decomposed into the binary composites available in the standard definition of double category.  So in defining prop-like double-category structures (at one time I planned to call them "double caterads") you have to decide whether to allow "pinwheel composites".</p>

<p>I think a nice way to construct and compare double-categorical structures is in terms of monads on the category of <em>double computads</em>, which have objects, two kinds of arrows without compositions, and 2-cells with the same shapes as in a double caterad but without any compositions there either.  There should be monads on this category whose algebras are (1) double categories, (2) augmented double categories, in which pinwheels etc. can be composed, (3) double caterads, (4) augmented double caterads, (5) doubly-weak double categories, and (6) augmented doubly-weak double categories.</p>

<p>The notions of doubly-weak double category that have been suggested elsewhere then arise by restricting the shapes that you allow in the double computads.  Verity's <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/double%20bicategories">[[double bicategories]]</a> have just squares and bigons, while the "cubical bicategories" once proposed by Garner have only squares.</p>

<p>Just to clarify, "weak" in this context is being used to mean nonrepresentable/"virtual", rather than "pseudo". Double categories that have composition in both directions, but associative/unital only up to isomorphism have been studied in the literature before, under the name <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/double%20bicategories">[[double bicategories]]</a>.</p>

<p>Verity's double bicategories are <em>a</em> notion of "doubly-weak double category", but they're a little odd because they have bigons as separate data in addition to the squares, and in particular a double bicategory in which all the coherences are identities is more general than a strict double category in the traditional sense.  One of the virtues of the double-caterad approach to doubly-weak double categories is that it avoids this issue.</p>

<p>I don't have it written down in explicit form.  My half-written notes define them as algebras for a monad on the category of double computads, but the monad isn't very explicit.  The definition is basically you have composition and unit operations on both sets of arrows, with no axioms, and then a set of squares with any possible sequences of composable arrows on all four boundaries, with "all the possible composition operations" of those.</p>

<p>I don't even know whether there is a finite presentation of that definition.</p>

<p>I think it should be possible to give an equivalent definition by starting with a <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/double%20bicategory">[[double bicategory]]</a> and then imposing as an extra axiom that the canonical maps from bigons to degenerate squares are bijections.</p>

<p>That might be easiest for formalization.</p>

<p>Thanks - I'll give that a try.</p>
