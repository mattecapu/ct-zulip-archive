<p>This is definitely a vibes-based question, but I'm interested to hear what people think counts as "doing calculations" in category theory.</p>
<p>As an example from my own field, when I'm solving a physics problem I often end up needing to solve some integral. There might be nice conceptual and physically-motivated reasons for why I end up with that integral, but in the actual process of solving it - throwing integral tricks at it and the like - I'm not really trying to find a physical interpretation for each step. It's like I'm using a different part of my brain, or a different mode of thinking, one that's a lot more "computational".</p>
<p>I'm sure there's an analogous phenomenon in mathematics. In category theory, I've sometimes found manipulating ends and coends using fubini and yoneda reduction to count as a kind of "calculation". What else might fall under that umbrella?</p>

<p>In part this was inspired by reading Borceux’s “Handbook of Categorical Algebra” recently, particularly the various results on split/effective/regular/strong/extremal flavours of monos and epis. The proofs there felt very “computational” to me, I guess?</p>

<p>Certainly following a chain of isomorphisms counts. And moving string diagrams around. But also computing with the operations of orthogonal classes (that can be "algebraicized" to a certain extent). Splitting a big diagram in smaller diagrams each of which commutes. </p>
<p>Some people, who I owe a great debt as teachers, showed me that category theory can be less handwavy and more calculation-oriented. For example Jacobs' books or the very recent book of Adamek and Milius on algebras and coalgebras.</p>

<p>At the opposite end of the spectrum I feel that some results tied to the adjoint functor theorem are less computational: a single example I recently re-learned is this, in order to appeal to Theorem 6.1 here <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/transfinite+construction+of+free+algebras">https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/transfinite+construction+of+free+algebras</a> one has to rely on a concrete step (build a certain pushout) and then a more blackbox-y step; the answer is the colimit of such-and-such, whatever it is.</p>

<p>(of course "concrete" and "abstract" are ill-defined concepts, someone could chime in and say well no, the colimit of a chain is a <em>very</em> concrete way to describe something and I can compute with it, look, there's an initial cocone, and the universal property says that...)</p>

<p>Polya used to say "a tool is a trick I use twice"; I can easily see tricks in category theory (the backbone of the idea in the proof of the fact that every category admits a conservative functor into Set), and tools (the examples given in this list)...</p>

<p>I don't really think this is quite the same. What Joachim is referring to there is the algebraic pattern structure on the simplex category: a factorization system that splits any map into its "inert" and "active" parts --- these are his "geometric" and "algebraic" parts respectively. This is because a presheaf on inerts which satisfies the Segal condition is the same thing as a graph --- which Joachim is taking to be a kind of generalized space --- while a presheaf on inerts and actives satisfying the Segal condition is a category because the actives correspond precisely to the generalized composition operations in the essentially algebraic theory of categories. </p>
<p>In my above story, both of these things are in the positive side of the picture. There is an essentially algebraic theory of categories which presents a simple dependent type theory generated by the judgements that there is a type of objects, that for two objects there is a type of morphisms between them, that for any object there is an identity arrow, for two composable arrows there is a composite, and the laws. </p>
<p>The difference between the inerts and the actives is reflected in this type theory as follows: the inerts are, roughly speaking, the weakenings: the maps between contexts which reflect forgetting about some of the variables in them. The actives correspond to the substitutions which use all of the variables in the context. I don't know when type theories admit active-inert factorization systems on their categories of contexts, but I think it's an interesting question. </p>
<p>Anyway, for me the "geometric part" is not "all the underlying bookkeeping" --- that's what the type theory is for. Rather, the "geometric part" (or, I would prefer, the "spatial" part, since there's really no metric or measurement involved) concerns spaces of functions, streams, or types. These come with a natural "topology", sometimes literally as in the Cantor space of functions $$\mathbb{N} \to \{0, 1\}$ or equivalently bit-streams; or the Dedekind reals, which are a subset of the space of type families varying over a pair of rationals.</p>

<p>Thanks for the clarification, David! Could you continue from that last paragraph to say why you take computation performed on "spatial" data to be on the negative side? This is the sense of right universal properties (<a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/negative+type">[[negative type]]</a>)?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/type+theory">type theory</a>, a <strong>negative type</strong> is one whose <em><a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/term+elimination">eliminators</a></em> are regarded as primary. Its <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/term+introduction">constructors</a> are derived from these by the rule that “to construct an element of a negative type, it is necessary and sufficient to specify how that element behaves upon applying all of the eliminators to it”.</p>

<p>Syntactically, this reflects "rigidity"--in the 1-pov this is simply the assertion that equations between terms don't make use of any structural operations (including weakening) to align their contexts.  This means that every term-in-context has a "trace" of which structural rules have been used on it, and this "trace" is invariant under permissible rewritings.</p>

<p>I'm usually inclined to agree with this view.</p>
<p>One thing I always have in mind, though, is that <em>calculus</em> should <em>literally</em> feel like handling pebbles to figure out the shape of something. To me, this is like "trying to decompose" a structure in category theory.</p>
<p>For example, expressing an object as a coend, end, limit, colimit, sum, product, etc. feels like rearranging the pieces to better see the overall structure.</p>

<p>Now, the deduction rules are more like <em>memorizing or mimicking the steps</em> without actually matching the pebbles. They let you reproduce the same results symbolically, so you can do calculus without thinking about the individual units at all.</p>

<p>A friend asked me this question when I was in grad school and starting out in a career in category theory.  However, she phrased it specifically as "do you ever compute anything in category theory <em>and not know in advance what the answer will be</em>?"  At the time I didn't have any good examples for her, and I still don't.  Unless I missed something all the kinds of "computation" that I've seen mentioned above are more about verifying something we already expected to be true rather than calculating a result that we didn't know in advance.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276777">@Mike Shulman</span> Contractibility questions are usually like that: you do not know in advance whether something reduces to something smaller. You try to build a contraction by decomposing it into smaller contractible pieces and checking that the pieces glue in a contractible way. If it works, you learned something real. If it fails, the failure is informative, and if you really need a contractible result you might add an axiom (or restrict the setting) that forces the missing contraction step to exist, then try again.</p>
<p>It feels like physics: you propose a model that should match a phenomenon, you check whether it closes on the data, and if it does not you enrich the model by adding a variable or assumption, then test again.</p>

<p>I would say calculating to see if a (pre)sheaf is representable is close to this. </p>
<p>I can offer an example of when I had to rewrite a limit of diffeological spaces in a bunch of different ways to the point where the limit manifestly existed as a smooth manifold because I could arrange that a bunch of maps were submersions, and so there was iterative construction of the limit purely via pullbacks of submersions, which do of course exist. Sometimes it really wasn't clear if I could get rid of equalisers in the construction, which are problematic in Mfld.</p>
<p>In  similar but simpler cases this is working with calculating a set-builder notation expression with generalised elements through various isomorphisms so that one has a simpler expression for a limit, or a more conceptually clear limit.</p>

<p>I feel like determining the behavior of an adjoint can often feel very calculational in the in the sense <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276777">@Mike Shulman</span> described above. Often I find myself knowing that some functor has an adjoint but not knowing anything specific about it and using various elementary manipulations to try and produce a more recognizable and concrete form. And often I go into this process not having a super clear understanding of whether or not a more satisfactory description exists, let alone what form it might take. Perhaps that's merely a testament to not having finely honed by adjunction skills...</p>
<p>It's a bit different in that I can give a mathematically precise definition of what the canonical form of a finitely-generated abelian group is, but I have no such criteria for what a "good" description of a functor.</p>

<p>From the discussion, we might say there are three (non-orthogonal) aspects: the degree to which there's a method to crank out an answer rather than to search for one; the degree to which the form of the answer is prefixed; and, the degree to which the answer is unknown rather than anticipated.</p>
<p>A paradigmatic example of a calculation is where one cranks out an unknown answer in a prefixed form.</p>

<p>I am a pure mathematician at heart; I understand (like, get along with..) mathematicians better than computer scientists in all but one respect: that they don't brush off as a menial task the obligation to exhibit these arguments explicitly. It is hard, when you are young and you are trying to learn how to do this job, to understand what exactly is accepted as proof, what is the allowed level of handwaving. None, 10%, 50%? I still remember thinking "I must be very stupid, because these things that people pull off with no effort or dirty hands instead require, to me, a lot of <em>computation</em>!"</p>

<p>I've wondered about when it's okay to omit calculations in math as well, I don't think it's completely arbitrary.</p>
<p>I think statements of the Yoneda lemma would be clearer if the underlying calculation were shared in the statement for example. However, tools like synquid (<a href="https://github.com/nadia-polikarpova/synquid">https://github.com/nadia-polikarpova/synquid</a>) can automatically infer programs from types for many non trivial examples, with the yoneda type signature analog being an especially easy case.</p>
<p>This, and other tools like this, make me wonder if it's possible to be precise about when it's okay for mathematicians to leave out calculations.</p>
<p>In particular, I suspect many standard results in category theory could be automated easily. That seems to be a big point of it is my impression, it's supposed to make theory easy.</p>
<p>I guess implicit in this is how does this transition from "making easy results thoughtless" to "making truly hard results possible" happen in a subject like calculus? And could that happen more in category theory?</p>
<p>I've been bitten enough by "easy" problems I'd be fine if that were all category theory helped with.</p>
<p>A related thought, although not calculational, I think Mac Lane's coherence theorem is truly difficult but then you can dodge it by working with unbiased definitions. So my takeaway was "hard" results in category theory might be a clue that that the definitions should be reworked.</p>
<p>So by analogy I'm expecting "good" calculations should be "easy" in category theory. And to get too hung up on that being a flaw, I worry might miss the point.</p>

<p>I often try to use category theory to <em>avoid</em> calculations, replacing them by verbal arguments that allow us to <em>see</em> that a result is true.  This usually works best for results that have snappy, attractive statements.</p>
<p>However, there are many other results in math that seem to require calculations.  Category theory sometimes gets used as an infrastructure for these calculations, e.g. computing co/homology groups with the help of homological algebra resting on the infrastructure of abelian categories.</p>

<p>A wise man, expert of homological algebra, once told me that there is essentially only one way to compute in homological algebra: spectral sequences. The kind of proofs one sees in elementary H.A. can be reduced to degenerate cases of spectral sequences</p>
<p>And spectral sequences (another wise man told me) escape much of the usual "it's just an X in the category of Y" business. They truly are a machinery, so to speak.</p>
<p>Now I wonder: is it possible to prove the second wise man wrong?</p>

<p>Hmm, I may have mixed a few things up. Looking in my notes, I came up with this paper from 1991:</p>

</ul>
<p>which is obviously not at all recent, but I was reading it recently. This paper does connect double categories to spectral sequences in some way, but I didn't read that section in detail. I've also mentioned before that Maru Sarazola has used double categories to think about the Waldhausen construction:</p>

<p>If I were ever going to seriously try to understand spectral sequences, which would mean reinterpreting them as something that pleases me more, I'd start with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serre_spectral_sequence">Serre spectral sequence</a>, since this seems like a simple and 'conceptually nice' example.   The idea is that you're trying to compute the cohomology of the total space of a fibration when you know the cohomology of the base and the fiber.  You try to do it by studying what happens when you restrict the fibration to the n-skeleta of the base.</p>
<p>But I have always avoided getting into this, and I expect I may manage to avoid it forever.</p>
