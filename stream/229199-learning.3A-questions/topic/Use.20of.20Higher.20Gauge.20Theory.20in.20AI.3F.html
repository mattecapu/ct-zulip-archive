<p>"I’ve been working on a framework that treats transformers not as black boxes, but as computational gauge fields, where reasoning, performance, and interpretability come with mathematical guarantees."</p>
<p>So I recently come across a rather <em>interesting</em> line of thought being peddled based on applying non-abelian gauge theory to create robust AI models.</p>
<p>I can't help but wonder though...is this guy...for real? I personally don't feel well read up enough on modern AI to really make a judgement here, but his line of thought is something that naturally appeals to me.</p>
<p>Apologies, but one but one must be cautious when seeing posts on linkedn discussing sheaf cohomology. Anyone more learned than me have any thoughts? I'd rather hear the truth than get suckered in based on my own biases.</p>

<p>Google isn't returning any result for "BCH plaquette", "Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff plaquette", nor I manage to find meaning in this jumble of words. So I suspect the concept doesn't exist; even if it does exist, I bet it is misused.</p>

<p>Most importantly, none of this shit makes sense.   And I know higher gauge theory: I helped write the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0511710">Higher gauge theory</a> which helped start the subject.</p>

<p>Well, my main aim is trying to understand the physical limits of how computation can happen. I got interested in understanding this emerging trend of geometry+AI because my gut feeling is that I could find examples of computational geometric bordisms/decorated homotopy 1-types "in the wild."</p>
<p>The professional version: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00873">https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00873</a> (Sorry, helices again. You can't avoid them.)</p>
<p>If I had to sum up what's going on here in a few words..."Curvature as Computation"?</p>
<p>The state of this <em>intersection</em>, call it what you might, is similar to HTT in like the mid 90's? But much more fragmented. It's split between AI, CT, gauge theory, and diff geometry, existing in a kind of...<em>primordial math soup</em>. It will probably coalesce into a more manageable form by around 2030 or so. </p>
<p>I looked further afield than the usual places to see if I could find useful ideas "on the fringe", I guess not in this particular case.</p>
