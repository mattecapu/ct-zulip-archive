<p>The last few weeks I've been exploring Grothendieck topologies, as well as the different notions of topological-esque space, which has been very informative. In the last topic, we discussed ways of characterizing space-like objects. But in category theory, there's two ways of going about abstracting a mathematical property. One can do it at the object level, like how in the previous topic we abstracted elements of topological spaces to understand topological-esque spaces. But the other way is to do it at the category level, where we take an entire category of some mathematical objects and abstract its properties, getting a class of categories with some extra property or structure equipped. These definitions put the focus more on the categories than their objects and as such their objects may - but also might not- be concretely realized as "sets with extra structure".</p>
<p>There's many ways I found to do this when it comes to defining what it means for a category to be a "category of spaces". Here are some that I noticed. As we discussed before, <em>Grothendieck topologies</em> are the first that come to mind, enabling an abstraction of the notion of "open" from topological spaces to general categories. There's also <em>categorical homotopy theory</em> including things like model categories and certain infinity categories, which abstract homotopy theory from topological spaces to general categories. Slightly more concretely, we also have <em>Grothendieck "gros topos"</em>, which under the philosophy of "generalized spaces" have objects which can be interpreted as, well, generalized spaces. We also have categories equipped with a topological forgetful functor, AKA <em>topologically concrete categories</em>, which all the categories of topological-esque spaces possess. Lastly, we have <em>"synthetic categories"</em> of spaces, such as smooth topos or cohesive topos, where we specify axioms these categories are supposed to possess.</p>

<p>My question here is similar to my opener for the last topic. Is there a notion of the "most general" kind of "category of space", such that such a category with structure is induced by all other cases? Are there any interesting connections or intersections between these kinds of "category of space"? (Well, other than the obvious one that a category with a Grothendieck topology gives rise to a Grothendieck topos via the sheaf category construction. A good example of a connection would be if one can prove that <em>all</em> smooth topos or cohesive topos are Grothendieck and thus can all be thought of as consisting of sheaves on some site.) Again, the main goal here is to determine a notion of "locality", but unlike in the last topic where we considered this within an object, I now want to consider this on the level of a category to determine what a "category with locality" is like. Thanks for any help you can provide!</p>

<p>Again, the answer will be "I doubt it", because once you zoom out from objects, there are usually multiple choices of morphism available preserving different amounts of "spatial" structure. Think of metric spaces: one has continuous maps, but also multiple different choices of map interacting with the metric in other ways. The resulting categories (for the respective morphism types) have some things in common, but it may not be clear without a particular goal in mind which of them deserves to be enshrined in a "most general" notion of category of spaces.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a more interesting answer would be to point you to some of the categorical properties that arise in doing what you're describing. I think <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/topological%20category">[[topological category]]</a> may be a good place to start?</p>

<p>I've been trying to dig up the recent discussion of "best generalization" that occurred either here on Zulip or on MO before, but my search has failed. To repeat the point I surely made in that discussion,  identifying common features of examples is surely generalization, but there is no <em>a priori</em> criterion for which categories are included in the collection to be generalized: you need a goal or justification for what exactly it is about spaces that you're trying to capture. The weaker the criterion for being a category of spaces, the weaker the properties that satisfying that criterion will impose, consequently restricting what you can actually do at that level of generality. On the other hand, if you succeed in finding a very general unifying feature and actually want to try lifting results which apply to special cases (the motivating examples), you will be forced to identify what further special features/hypotheses underpin that result, which can eventually be very illuminating when compared with the usual trajectory of using whatever structure one has to hand in studying a special case directly. (I can elaborate on that last point if it's too vague to be meaningful).</p>

<p>My goal would be to have a category with sufficient structure to define a notion of "locality" internal to it. But as I've learned on a previous topic here, "locality" might be a vague term with many possible meanings. For instance, it might refer to objects that have a defined notion of "closeness" or "apartness" for their parts given by a relation of some kind, but it might also refer to operations where one "glues together" parts into a whole, which is given by a gluing operation instead.</p>

<p>"Schemes", I believe, are geometric things, made from algebraic things. You can start with any commutative ring and make a scheme from it. So, from this angle, the category of commutative rings is also a geometric setting: each object contains the data needed to construct a corresponding geometric thing. I don't know if this would count as a category of "spaces" for you, though.</p>

<p>That book explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An affine scheme is an object made from a commutative ring. The relationship is modeled on and generalizes the relationship between an affine variety and its coordinate ring...Scheme theory arises if we adopt the opposite point of view: if we do not accept the restrictions “finitely generated,” “nilpotent-free” or “K-algebra” and insist that the right-hand side include all commutative rings, what sort of geometric object should we put on the left? The answer is “affine schemes”...</p>

<p>That's a great example I didn't list above! It's part of a more general scheme called the "duality between space and algebra".

<p>This brings me to a new question: how exactly are "space categories dual to an algebraic category" and "categories of generalized spaces" related? I know there's strong connections between these two ideas (IE, both the philosophy of "space and quantity" and their duality, and the philosophy of "generalized spaces"). But while schemes in general are indeed "generalized spaces" in the sense of being sheaves on some site (actually, sheaves on affine schemes), the same isn't true for affine schemes. That's because the category of affine schemes is not a topos and so its objects are not sheaves on some site and thus are not generalized spaces (nor is the category of commutative rings, meaning they can't be cosheaves/generalized quantity on some site either). So how do these two ideas connect, especially in this example of schemes?</p>

However this isn't possible since neither are toposes while both the categories involved in the Isbell duality are toposes.<br>
In addition the Isbell duality is an adjunction, while the relationship between affine schemes and the opposite category of commutative rings is an equivalence, which is even stronger than an adjunction!</p>

<p>Mmh, I don't know a lot about algebraic geometry, but, if I recall correctly, schemes are "locally made up of affine schemes". </p>
<p>Looking at the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/scheme#as_sheaves_on_">nlab</a>, there is a definition of a scheme as  a sheaf on a category of rings.</p>
<p>The passage from the usual definition (locally ringed space with an open cover whose parts are isomorphic to affine schemes) to the one above is detailed further <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/scheme#translation_between_the_two_approaches">down the page</a>.

<p>Let me take a break from Isbell duality for the time being since I'm just confusing myself more and more... What I want to do next is organize the "topos-y" categories of space together. First, I want to understand something. Oftentimes, when people are discussing toposes in geometric terms, they use the word "topos" to mean specifically Grothendieck toposes- that is, those of sheaves on some site. In geometric contexts, the notion of an "elementary topos" is therefore wholly irrelevant. Is this the case when discussing smooth and cohesive toposes? For instance, I briefly reviewed Urs Schreiber's book "Differential cohomology in a differential infinity-topos" where he defines an "<span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">(∞,1)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord">∞</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord">1</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span>-topos" to be a category with an accessible left exact fully faithful embedding into a presheaf category (valued in infinity groupoids), which seems to be precisely the definition of a sheaf topos, not an elementary topos. But at the same time, it also states that this topos is only an "<span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">(∞,1)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord">∞</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord">1</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span>-topos of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">(∞,1)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord">∞</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord">1</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span>-sheaves" only if this localization is a "topological localization".

But if it's the latter, then why does that not appear for the 1-category case wherein all left exact reflections of a presheaf category are sheaf topos? Any help in clearing this confusion is appreciated!</p>

<p>For instance, I briefly reviewed Urs Schreiber's book "Differential cohomology in a differential infinity-topos" where he defines an "(∞,1)-topos" to be a category with an accessible left exact fully faithful embedding into a presheaf category (valued in infinity groupoids), which seems to be precisely the definition of a sheaf topos, not an elementary topos.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm no expert, but I think this would reduce to the definition of sheaf topos if you changed the phrase "valued in infinity groupoids" to the phrase "valued in sets", and perhaps turned some other knobs, not clearly emphasized in what you wrote, from their "(∞,1)" setting down to their "1"  setting.  </p>
<p>For example, saying an (∞,1)-topos is a <em>category</em> sounds weird to me: it's a kind of (∞,1)-category.   So beware: in some literature people get so sick of saying "(∞,1)-category" that they abbreviate this as "category", and similarly for "(∞,1)-functor" and so on.</p>

<p>I found it <a href="https://pure-oai.bham.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/163616523/2022_01_10_HigherSheaves_AiM_definitive_.pdf">here</a>. If I'm understanding correctly, a "higher site" is a category equipped with a class of maps in its presheaf topos. A higher sheaf with respect to a higher site is then a local object with respect to the "congruence" generated by this class of map. In addition, every local object with respect to some congruence is a higher sheaf for some higher site. A congruence on the other hand is just a class of maps in the presheaf topos that is closed under composition, colimits, and finite limits, so it's not too difficult to understand! The paper also shows how higher sites reduce to typical ones in certain scenarios- a higher site is the same as a "normal" site when the congruence generated by the higher site's class of morphisms is "topological", meaning that the original class of morphisms consisted of monomorphisms! Anyways I hope I understood this sufficiently!</p>

<p>Hi everyone hope you had a great Thanksgiving. I want to come back by continuing the discussion of toposes and sites, this time in the context of cohesive toposes. On both the nlab page and in Urs Schreiber's book, a "cohesive site" is given as a kind of site whose category of sheaves is guaranteed to be a cohesive topos. However, the converse does not seem to be true- given a cohesive topos, only the ones where "pieces have points" are categories of sheaves on cohesive sites. So my question is: why aren't all cohesive toposes generated by sheaves on cohesive sites? Is this for the same reason as discussed above- the concept of a "sheaf on a site" isn't powerful enough, meaning we should instead consider "higher sheaves on higher sites" (in the sense we discussed above, as a category equipped with a class of morphism in the presheaf category)? In this case, it would be true that, given some generalization of cohesive site to the higher site setting, every cohesive topos is generated by a "cohesive higher site". Or is the problem in the definition of a cohesive site, in which case, is there a weaker notion of "cohesive site" such that sheaves or higher sheaves on that site do generate all cohesive toposes? Thanks!</p>

<p>It's mainly a question of how someone chose to define "cohesive site".  Maybe it should have been called a "cohesive site with points".</p>

<p>But I think there's another important difference between the 1-categorical and <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord">∞</span></span></span></span>-categorical approach that needs to be discussed. As we covered above, <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord">∞</span></span></span></span>-topos are always Grothendieck as they are always lex reflective subcategories of a presheaf topos. In addition, there's no such thing as an <em>elementary</em> <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord">∞</span></span></span></span>-topos (well, there's not much agreement on how to define them, but it's still possible they might exist in some capacity). However, there is a such thing as an elementary 1-topos, which raises the question of if the axioms of a cohesive topos could still work, at least in some capacity, in the elementary case as opposed to the more specific Grothendieck case. </p>
<p>If this is the case, then it's certainly problematic. Lawvere imagined cohesive toposes to be an axiomatization of a "gros topos". Already there's plenty counterexamples of gros toposes that are not cohesive (like the topological topos). But this would provide evidence that the converse also isn't true, and that there are cohesive toposes that are not gros toposes. This is because, by definition, a gros topos is defined (and thus is required) to be a Grothendieck topos, otherwise it doesn't make sense to think of the objects as "generalized spaces".</p>

<p>But as Urs Schreiber covered in his paper, it's an objective fact that cohesive <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord">∞</span></span></span></span>-toposes are a generalization of cohesive 1-toposes. This raises a few possibilities of how to deal with both these pieces of information. The first possibility is that the forgetful functor from the category of cohesive toposes to all toposes lands in the subcategory of toposes on Grothendieck toposes. In other words, there simply can't be a cohesive topos whose underlying topos isn't Grothendieck.</p>
<p>But let's say it is possible. If that's true, then the fact that cohesive <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord">∞</span></span></span></span>-toposes generalize cohesive 1-toposes means that a cohesive 1-topos which isn't Grothendieck can <em>become</em> Grothendieck when passing to the <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord">∞</span></span></span></span> setting. That is, there exists an embedding of some sort from the category of cohesive toposes (even including the non-Grothendieck ones) to the category of cohesive <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord">∞</span></span></span></span>-toposes (which are all Grothendieck) that preserves all the important information. </p>
<p>I hope I'm understanding correctly, but it's my understanding that under the Homotopy Hypothesis the category of topological spaces, which isn't a topos at all in the 1-categorical setting, becomes one in the <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord">∞</span></span></span></span> setting. If this is true it means it might be possible for a non-Grothendieck topos to become Grothendieck in a similar way when passing from 1-categories to <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord">∞</span></span></span></span>-categories.</p>
<p>So my question is: what is the correct answer? Can cohesive non-Grothendieck toposes exist? And if so, is my guess for how cohesive <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord">∞</span></span></span></span>-toposes still act as generalizations of them correct?

<p>As for whether a non-Grothendieck topos can be cohesive, the property of cohesiveness of a Grothendieck topos (like many other properties of a topos, such as local connectedness and compactness) should really be regarded as a property of its geometric morphism to Set (or to <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi><mi>G</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>d</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\infty Gpd</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8889em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord">∞</span><span class="mord mathnormal">Gp</span><span class="mord mathnormal">d</span></span></span></span> in the <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord">∞</span></span></span></span>-topos case).

<p>How not? An infinity category generalizes a 1-category because a 1-category is an infinity category where all the higher morphisms are identities. It should be true that an infinity topos with all higher morphisms as identities should be equivalent to a 1-topos, right?</p>

<p>I see, so somehow I guess this implies that knowing all the path information about a topological space is only sufficient for a space that is a CW complex. Maybe this is analogous to how the lattice of opens is only sufficient if the space is sober? <br>
In any case I think categorical homotopy theory is interesting and it's one of the things I wanted to discuss here anyways since its relevant to finding "categories of spaces"!</p>

<p>Going back to relating cohesive toposes and gros toposes. A gros topos is a category of generalized spaces since it's a category of sheaves on a site where the objects are spaces, and so can be thought of as a category of spaces "locally modeled" on the spaces in the site. In a sense one can think of generalized spaces as consisting of "patching together" the spaces you are modeling on. Now one can see exactly how this leads into Lawvere's intuition of cohesive toposes as being categories where objects are collections of points with a notion of how those points "hang together". Once you can "patch together" spaces and thus their points, it's not hard to see how adding a bit of extra structure can allow one to extend this "patching together" of spaces to "hanging together" of points. </p>
<p>However, I'm running into a conceptual/philosophical problem with trying to understand what exactly the nature of objects in a non-Grothendieck cohesive topos are. They can't be "points with a notion of how they hang together" since "hanging together" requires some notion of "patching together", which brings you right back to sheaves. So if that's not it, then what exactly are they? And should they even be considered "spaces", or should an object of a cohesive topos only be considered a "space" if it's also Grothendieck?</p>

<p>This makes sense to me, though I'm still a little confused about why Schrieber mentioned that the infinity case generalized the lower dimensional case. Let me share one of his examples for why. Consider the site <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">C</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">r</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">t</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">p</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{CartSp}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8778em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">CartSp</span></span></span></span></span> of cartesian spaces and smooth maps between them. The category of sheaves on this site is the quintessential smooth topos of smooth sets, and includes all smooth manifolds as well as diffeological spaces. On the other hand, the category of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord">∞</span></span></span></span>-sheaves on this site is the category of smooth <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord">∞</span></span></span></span>-groupoids. </p>
<p>Apparently, this not only contains the smooth sets, but also things like orbifolds and essentially most if not all kinds of "manifold-y" things. The infinity case is then said to "generalize" the lower case since the 1-truncated objects in the category of smooth <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord">∞</span></span></span></span>-groupoids are the smooth sets from the original sheaf 1-topos.

<p>Here's some of my questions about this. First, is this a reasonable approach to answering the question of how the infinity topos case "generalizes" the 1-topos case? Second, it's clear that all Grothendieck 1-toposes embed into some <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord">∞</span></span></span></span>-topos given a choice of site of definition, just because <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">e</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{Set}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">Set</span></span></span></span></span> embeds into <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord">∞</span></span></span></span>-<span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">G</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">r</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">p</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">d</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{Grpd}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8889em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">Grpd</span></span></span></span></span> (and so 1-sheaves on the site embed into <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord">∞</span></span></span></span>-sheaves on that same site). However, is it always true that one can "go back" and recover the original 1-topos by taking the subcategory on all truncated objects in the <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord">∞</span></span></span></span>-topos, as we did with the category of smooth sets? Lastly, is category of truncated objects of an <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord">∞</span></span></span></span>-topos (a general one, so not required to be a category of sheaves on a site but rather just a lex reflective subcategory of a presheaf topos) necessarily a Grothendieck 1-topos, or can it be something more general?</p>

<p>This proposition is a little difficult to parse, but what it is saying that the functor from n-toposes to m-toposes given by sending any n-topos to its full subcategory of (m-1)-truncated objects admits a fully faithful right adjoint.</p>

<p>That's really interesting! After what I was told above I didn't think there was a canonical way to associate a lower topos with a higher topos.

Is that the case or also wrong?</p>
<p>This also makes me really curious about the properties of the adjunction between 1-toposes and <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord">∞</span></span></span></span>-toposes. For instance, what even are the involved categories? As mentioned before, there's not a standard notion of an elementary <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord">∞</span></span></span></span>-topos, so most likely we are working with Grothendieck <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord">∞</span></span></span></span>-toposes. But then, is the other category in the adjunction the category of elementary 1-toposes, or the category of Grothendieck 1-toposes? (I guess, in other words, this relates to my question of if the 1-topos of truncated objects of a <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord">∞</span></span></span></span>-topos has to be Grothendieck or not).</p>

<p>While I'm reviewing, I had a related question that I wanted to ask here. Recall that the category of sheaves on the site of Euclidean topological spaces includes topological manifolds, the category of sheaves on the site of Euclidean spaces with differentiable maps includes differentiable manifolds, and the category of sheaves on the site of Euclidean spaces with smooth maps includes smooth manifolds. There's one other case I wanted to consider.</p>
<p>On another thread, I learned that every finite real vector space has a unique topological structure. This gives a functor of the form <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">F</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">i</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">n</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">V</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">e</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">c</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">t</mi></mrow><mo>→</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">T</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">o</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">p</mi></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{FinVect} \to \mathrm{Top}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">FinVect</span></span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">→</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8778em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">Top</span></span></span></span></span>.

<p>Above I mentioned I want to understand more about categorical homotopy theory; after all that's the main motivation for introducing infinity categories (and thus infinity toposes) in the first place. The central object of focus in categorical homotopy theory is a "model category", which is a 1-category that "stands in" for some infinity category. Just as a Grothendieck topology gives an abstraction of an "open" and "open cover" from topology, the higher morphisms in the infinity category for a model category give an abstraction of a "higher homotopy" from topology.</p>
<p>First, is my basic understanding here correct? And if so, I'd like to start off by asking: on a conceptual/ philosophical level, to what extent can the objects of a model category (or the resulting infinity category) be considered "spaces"? For instance, is there any notion of "locality" induced by studying homotopies in this abstract of a way?</p>

The classical or "Quillen" model structure uses <em>weak</em> homotopy equivalences, so every space is equivalent to a CW complex and thus it presents the <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord">∞</span></span></span></span>-category of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord">∞</span></span></span></span>-groupoids.</p>

<p>That's interesting it isn't well-studied. I guess in the context of homotopy theory CW complexes just "work a lot better" than topological spaces.</p>
<p>I have some follow-ups about this. First, are topological spaces the most general setting of "space-like object" to do a traditional homotopy theory? That is, is it possible to do homotopy theory with pretopological, pseudotopological, approach, convergence, etc. (all the "generalized spaces" we went over on the previous topic) spaces, or are topological spaces the "most general" kind this is possible for? (and if they are, why?) </p>
<p>Secondly, when I hear about homotopy theory, I think of algebraic topology with fundamental groups (and more generally fundamental n-groupoids). Is there a model-theoretic analogue of the fundamental group construction- that is, given a model category, can I find a functor into the category of groups or n-groupoids that "acts like" the fundamental group/groupoid functor from normal topology? If not, then what is the use of extending homotopy theory outside of topology and into model categories if this fundamental use of homotopy is not possible?</p>

<p>You can certainly talk about homotopies and homotopy theory for any of those kinds of space.  I don't know which of them admit a full Quillen model structure.</p>

<p>I now want to try and link together categorical homotopy theory with gros toposes to see if they can produce a unified notion of "category of space". As we covered, every Grothendieck or gros 1-topos embeds into some infinity topos, so infinity topos theory generalizes the theory of gros toposes. However, infinity toposes are just one of a special case of locally presentable infinity categories, which are precisely those that come from combinatorial simplicial model categories. Even more generally, infinity categories with certain limits and colimits come from model categories, and most generally it seems any infinity category comes from a "category with weak equivalences". (Let me know if I got anything wrong here)</p>
<p>An even more concrete link between the two that I noticed and want to understand more about is the following quote from <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/locally+presentable+%28infinity%2C1%29-category#examples">locally presentable infinity category</a>: "The canonical example is the presentation of the infinity topos of infinity sheaves on a 1-site S by the simplicial model category of simplicial presheaves on S". What I'm wondering about is what exactly does this mean- does every site determine some model structure somewhere, and if so, how?</p>

<p>I've been going over through more basic homotopy theory, but I'm stumbling on some very elementary stuff! My first question is: given a category with weak equivalences, are the path space and cylinder objects for some given object unique?

<p>So I reviewed more about the model structure corresponding to a site. Here's my basic understanding of what is going on. Given a site, which is just a set of covering families <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>U</mi><mi>i</mi></msub><mo>→</mo><mi>X</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">U_i \to X</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8333em;vertical-align:-0.15em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.10903em;">U</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.3117em;"><span style="top:-2.55em;margin-left:-0.109em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mathnormal mtight">i</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.15em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">→</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07847em;">X</span></span></span></span>, there's a way to convert each covering family in the site into a single morphism in the category of simplicial presheaves. The way to do so is to take a sort of "Cech nerve" <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>C</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>U</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">C(U)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07153em;">C</span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.10903em;">U</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span> which then yields a morphism <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>C</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>U</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>→</mo><mi>X</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">C(U) \to X</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07153em;">C</span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.10903em;">U</span><span class="mclose">)</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">→</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07847em;">X</span></span></span></span> (a "Cech cover"), where, I guess, X is the representable (so the image of X under the Yoneda embedding followed by the embedding of presheaves into simplicial presheaves). </p>
<p>Then, the model structure for the site is when you start with the usual global model structure on simplicial presheaves and then, in a particularly way, freely add all morphisms of the form <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>C</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>U</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>→</mo><mi>X</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">C(U) \to X</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07153em;">C</span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.10903em;">U</span><span class="mclose">)</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">→</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07847em;">X</span></span></span></span> (the Cech covers corresponding to all the covering families in the site) to the class of weak morphisms in the model structure. In a sense, this is saying that the cover over an object is weakly equivalent to that object, which I guess is a sensible property for a cover to satisfy! The procedure for freely adding the weak equivalences is like a localization but instead of turning morphisms into equivalences it turns them into weak equivalences (which in the corresponding infinity category does end up turning them into equivalences).

<p>What I'm interested about most here is the connection between model structures and site structures- this relationship between them seems to suggest that one can view the latter concepts as appropriate cases of the former concepts! For this to be the case, one must be able to go backwards and recover the original site from the model structure. I think this is possible, so long as a particular condition is satisfied: that the notion of "category equipped with a site" is fully equivalent to "category equipped with a collection of Cech covers (morphisms of the form <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>C</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>U</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>→</mo><mi>X</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">C(U) \to X</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07153em;">C</span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.10903em;">U</span><span class="mclose">)</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">→</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07847em;">X</span></span></span></span>) in its category of simplicial presheaves". Obviously, as we have seen, the former induces the latter, and the weak localization is done on the Cech covers in that collection. I'm curious to know if given any collection of Cech covers if there's a way to go backwards to the original site.</p>
<p>Recall that model structures provide an abstract account of homotopy concepts, like homotopy, weak equivalence, and so on. A site structure provides an abstract account of open concepts, like open subset and open cover. If the above is true, it could imply many things, such as realizing the abstract notion of "open" as a special case of the abstract notion of "weak equivalence". In this case, an "open cover" is the special case of a weak equivalence, where a weak equivalence is an open cover precisely when it is also a Cech cover (and hopefully there's methods to determine if some morphism in, at the very least a category of simplicial presheaves, is a Cech cover without having to know which "family" it might have been generated from). I'm wondering if there's any interesting implications of this being true- let me know!</p>

<p>Hmm maybe it's controversial to assert that model structures are "more general" than site structures... But it's in the spirit of this thread to find the "most general" kind of category of space and I think that model categories and their variants are probably the best candidate so far!</p>

<p>I'm extremely confused about something. The nlab page "fibrant object" seems to imply that fibrant objects are those for which any object in a category has a weak equivalence to. But this doesn't make sense for a number of reasons. First, a category with the same class of weak equivalences can have multiple model structures with different fibrant objects. But obviously, given a class of weak equivalences, there's only one class of objects that all other objects have a weak equivalence to. Secondly, by the axioms of a model category and category with weak equivalences, every object is trivially weakly equivalent to itself, and thus for any category all objects should be fibrant at all times, which obviously is not the case. </p>
<p>This is also leading me to get confused about how the localization of topological spaces at weak equivalences in the classical model structure leads to a category equivalent to CW complexes. This is because every CW complex is weakly equivalent to a simplicial complex; therefore, since every space is homotopy equivalent to a CW complex and weak equivalence are closed under composition, every space should be weakly equivalent to a simplicial complex. Yet the localization does not lead to a category equivalent to that of simplicial complexes. A similar argument goes the other direction: every CW complex is homotopy equivalent to a "space with good cover", therefore every space should be homotopy equivalent to a "space with good cover". So why doesn't the localization happen at that subcategory? Any help in untangling this mess is greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>Ok, I think I see... so a subcategory of fibrant objects for some model structure would have the property that every object is weakly equivalent to some object in this subcategory. But depending on your choice of fibration this subcategory can include anything up to and including all objects in the category by the trivial weak equivalence. In Top I think this is the case where in the classical model structure all objects are fibrant. But there's other model structures on Top where different other classes of object are the fibrant ones.</p>

<p>Well above it was discussed that groupoids are equivalent to CW complexes. This is because the infinity category of infinity groupoids is equivalent to the infinity category generated by the classical model structure on Top. If the infinity category generated by the classical model structure on Top is the infinity category of CW complexes, this makes sense. But if it's some smaller category like the infinity category of simplicial complexes, then it's no longer accurate to say that groupoids are equivalent to CW complexes, just as it's not accurate to say that groupoids are equivalent to topological spaces as a whole (since the infinity category of topological spaces where we make all weak equivalences into actual equivalences is equivalent to the infinity category of CW complexes, symbolizing how we "lose" information about topological spaces until the only remaining information is that invariant to weak equivalences)</p>

<p>I'm still trying to understand the negative claim here.

<p>Sure. So I know for sure that the infinity category generated by the classical model structure on Top is equivalent to the infinity category of infinity groupoids. So whatever the objects of that infinity category are, they contain "the same information" as infinity groupoids.<br>
My claim is that the infinity category generated by the classical model structure on Top is equivalent to the infinity category of CW complexes, but NOT to the infinity category of simplicial constructs. That way, we can say for certain that infinity groupoids are equivalent to CW complexes.</p>

<p>I just want to get a precise statement of your negative claim.  You made precise the positive claim in one way (using homotopy categories, not infinity categories: Ho(Top) is equivalent to its full subcategory on the topological spaces homeomorphic to a CW complex), and indeed its true.  But I'm very suspicious of this negative claim, so I want to see it made precise.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="673117">@John Onstead</span> not sure if this is the answer you are looking for, but it is a general fact about model categories that one can present the homotopy category by only considering the <em>bifibrant</em> i.e. both fibrant and cofibrant objects as its objects. In the classical model structure on topological spaces the CW complexes are the bifibrant objects (in fact they are the cofibrant objects, and all objects are fibrant). More in general, cofibrations are "cellular extensions". Now, these have the crucial property that they are closed under pushouts along arbitrary maps, which must be true of the class of cofibrations in any model category. But "(simplicial) cellular extensions of simplicial complexes" are not closed under pushouts so you cannot replace CW complexes with simplicial complexes in constructing a model structure.</p>

<p>Ah! That is quite helpful. So given a model category, its homotopy category is equivalent to its subcategory on bifibrant objects. So under this definition, given CW complexes are the bifibrations in the classical model structure, the homotopy category would be equivalent to the category of CW complexes.</p>

<p>But I'm still confused by a few things. This still doesn't answer my original question: why does localizing by inverting every weak equivalence in Top only bring you down to the category of CW complexes, when every CW complex admits an additional weak equivalence to some simplicial complex? That is, why doesn't the localization process invert the weak equivalences that exist between every CW complex and some simplicial complex? I get that simplicial complexes are not closed under pushouts which disqualifies them from being cofibrant objects, that makes sense. But whether or not something is closed under pushouts has absolutely no bearing whatsoever on whether you can freely invert some morphism via localization.</p>
<p>Here's a syllogism: "Every top space is weakly equivalent to some CW complex. Every CW complex is weakly equivalent to some simplicial complex. Therefore, every top space is weakly equivalent to some simplicial complex". What is wrong about this syllogism? The transitive property holds since weak equivalences are closed under composition, so it can't be logically false.</p>
<p>Sorry I'm having such a tough time understanding this...</p>

<p>Well, the standard model structure on simplicial sets has Kan complexes as its bifibrant objects, and by the nerve construction every infinity groupoid corresponds to some Kan complex. I believe this is an equivalence; that is, every Kan complex is equivalent to the nerve of some infinity groupoid. So to refine my question: is every CW complex presented by some Kan complex?</p>

<p>Let's axiomatically (as in- don't think about) assume that the homotopy category of a model category is given by its subcategory on bifibrant objects. Then the bifibrant objects of topological spaces under weak homotopy equivalence are the CW complexes, and so our axiom tells us that the homotopy category is that of CW complexes. But earlier you made the statement that "Ho(Top) is equivalent to topological spaces homeomorphic to a simplicial complex". If we take this at face value to, we now have the following equivalences: <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">H</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">o</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">T</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">o</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">p</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mo>≅</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">C</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">W</mi></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{Ho(Top)} \cong \mathrm{CW}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">Ho</span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathrm">Top</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">≅</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm" style="margin-right:0.01389em;">CW</span></span></span></span></span> and <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">H</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">o</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">T</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">o</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">p</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><mo>≅</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">i</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">m</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">p</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">C</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">o</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">m</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">p</mi></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{Ho(Top)} \cong \mathrm{SimpComp}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">Ho</span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathrm">Top</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">≅</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8778em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">SimpComp</span></span></span></span></span>.

<p>How? Aren't CW complexes the bifibrant objects in topological spaces with respect to weak equivalences? Do you mean that the localization at weak equivalences somehow induce a different kind of map than the usual continuous ones?</p>

<p>That's odd... a localization of a category (or, for that matter, taking its subcategory on a particular kind of object, say bifibrant objects) embeds into that category. Since an embedding is a fully faithful functor and Top is concrete over Set, the composition of the embedding of Ho(Top) into Top and the forgetful functor into Set should be a faithful functor.</p>

<p>Oh dear! A localization of a category doesn't always embed into the category... I was thinking of reflective localizations but I just found out (doing a bit of re-reading) not every localization is reflective. My bad...<br>
Still, this implies that the subcategory on bifibrant objects isn't actually the same as the localization at weak equivalences, since we know for sure the former embeds while the latter only does so in reflective scenarios. So that leaves me confused again about the true relationship between these.</p>

<p>That's a good exercise! I did some more reading and I think I know what the morphisms in Ho(Top) are: they are homotopy classes of morphism in Top. Implicitly, when you "collapse" the infinity category down to the homotopy category, you turn all 2-isomorphisms (the homotopies) into equalities, which explains this. <br>
So if I is the unit interval, the cardinality of Hom(I, I) is infinity. Any choice of real number between 0 and 1 corresponds to a path in the unit interval (if the base of the path is fixed at 0), so there's uncountably many options. But as for homotopy classes of maps, and thus morphisms in Ho(Top), the cardinality should be 1. The interval is homotopy equivalent to the point.</p>

<p>That's right!   So, you can begin to see how working in Ho(Top) simplifies things.  </p>
<p>More precisely, homotopy classes of morphisms between <em>bifibrant</em> objects in Top correspond to morphisms between them in Ho(Top).  (There are stronger results along these lines, but this is good enough for these "exercises".)</p>

<p>It's the integers, right? If you have a path that doesn't close around the circle, it can contract to a point, and we label it "zero". Then there's the path that loops clockwise around the circle and the one that loops counterclockwise, which we call 1 and -1. And then looping 2 times, 3 times, and so on.<br>

<p>Yes, it's the integers!  </p>
<p>There's a nuance: the well-known "fundamental group" of the circle is the integers - but that's the set of <em>base-point preserving</em> homotopy classes of <em>base-point preserving</em> maps from the circle to itself.  I wasn't asking about that.  I was asking about the set of homotopy classes of maps from the circle to itself.  But this too is the set of integers!   </p>
<p>Often the two base-point preserving conditions change the answer, but in this case you can show it doesn't!</p>

<p>It's pretty easy to define the 'winding number' for arbitrary maps from the circle to itself and show it's invariant under homotopy.  With a bit more work you can show it's a complete invariant, i.e. two maps with the same winding number are homotopy equivalent.</p>

<p>Ah, that's interesting!<br>
Well, now that I understand things a bit better, I think I'm more prepared to go back to my original concern. It's comparing the categories of CW complexes and homotopy classes of maps between them (which we showed is equivalent to the category Ho(Top) ), and the category of simplicial complexes and homotopy classes of maps between them. But even now I'd still insist that these are not equivalent categories. This is because the objects of the first category are bifibrant objects in the model structure on Top and the objects of the latter are not, so their categories should not be equivalent (otherwise, under the principle of equivalence, we'd have to be able to interpret the simplicial complexes as the bifibrant objects of Top, which we shouldn't be allowed to do). In addition, if they were, then we wouldn't say that objects of Ho(Top) is equivalent to CW complexes, we'd say it's equivalent to simplicial complexes- which we don't do!</p>

<p>I believe every topological space is weakly homotopy equivalent to a simplicial complex.  Certainly every topological space is weakly homotopy equivalent to the geometric realization of a simplicial <em>set</em>.  And my vague memory is that if you start with a simplicial set and do enough things to it like the category of simplices and the barycentric subdivision, you get a simplicial complex that's weakly homotopy equivalent to it.</p>

<p>Maybe this is what I was trying to demonstrate in my syllogism above: "Every space is weakly equivalent to a CW complex. Every CW complex is weakly equivalent to a simplicial complex (since a homotopy equivalence is a weak equivalence). Therefore, by the property that weak equivalences are closed under composition, every space is weakly equivalent to a simplicial complex". My question at the beginning was: why then does localizing at the weak equivalence not yield simplicial complexes instead of CW complexes? But if Ho(Top) is equivalent to its full subcategory with simplicial complexes as objects, this resolves the problem- it turns out that localizing at weak equivalences <em>does</em> yield simplicial complexes.</p>

<p>This also clearly implies then that the principle of equivalence is violated- the bifibrant objects can be equivalent to a class of objects that are patently not the bifibrant objects (IE, not closed under pushouts). Thus in some ways this concept is "evil". I find that massively uncomfortable.</p>

<p>But this brings me back to the notion of "equivalence" in infinity categories. Under the above observation, we have a three-way equivalence between the simplicial localization of Top (whose objects are ALL topological spaces), the simplicial localization of CW complexes, and the simplicial localization of simplicial complexes. However, in spite of all three of these infinity categories being equivalent, we only ever say that Kan complexes are equivalent to CW complexes- not all topological spaces, but not simplicial complexes either. What is the explanation for this? Why can't we say that Kan complexes are equivalent to all topological spaces when there exists a category of all topological spaces equivalent to that of CW complexes? Likewise, how can we be sure that Kan complexes consist of enough information to fully define any CW complex, thus justifying not saying that Kan complexes and simplicial complexes are equivalent?</p>

<p>This also clearly implies then that the principle of equivalence is violated- the bifibrant objects can be equivalent to a class of objects that are patently not the bifibrant objects (IE, not closed under pushouts). Thus in some ways this concept is "evil". I find that massively uncomfortable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps by "IE" you mean "e.g."?  But bifibrant objects are not in general closed under pushouts.  They are closed under <em>homotopy</em> pushouts, as is any category that's equivalent to them.  I'm not sure what form of equivalence principle you think is being violated.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="673117">@John Onstead</span> What you need to keep in mind is that, to <em>define</em> the homotopy category, you only need a class of weak equivalences; this should tell you that the homotopy category has no memory at all of (co)fibrants and (co)fibrations or any of the additional structure of a model category.<br>
What a model structure gives you is (among other things) a particular <em>presentation</em> of the homotopy category (and, with more modern machinery, an <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord">∞</span></span></span></span>-category), as well as better criteria to decide whether two presentations are equivalent in the sense that they present the same homotopy category up to categorical equivalence.</p>

<p>And the point I made about cofibrations and the need for them to be closed under pushouts indicates that you cannot have a model structure <em>on the category of topological spaces and continuous maps</em> whose cofibrations are "simplicial complex cellular extensions", but you can with CW complexes and their cellular extensions.</p>

<p>But in a certain sense the Kan--Quillen model structure on simplicial <em>sets</em> tells you that you can make it work if you restrict to the category of simplicial sets and their morphisms, which you can think of as a non-full subcategory of topological spaces and continuous maps via "geometric realisation", and you do end up having the "same" homotopy category.</p>

<p>I think I see what you are saying. Just as two isomorphic groups can have non-isomorphic presentations, two equivalent infinity categories have non equivalent presentations.

<p>I think I was just worried about saying something like "Kan complexes are equivalent to CW complexes" if such a statement didn't also hold in the 1-categorical case. Because I guess it would sound misleading if you didn't already know we were working in the homotopy/infinity category setting. Just as misleading as the original version of the nlab article you corrected which stated that topological spaces were equivalent to Kan complexes!</p>

<p>Hi! Thanks for all the help before... I can get frustrated with stuff when I don't understand it so I appreciate your patience! Now, continuing on...</p>
<p>As I was learning more about doing homotopy theory in a category with weak equivalences, I noticed a peculiarity: the definitions took "map space" and "cylinder" objects as fundamental, and nowhere to be seen was the notion of an "interval". This was really odd since in Top map space and cylinder objects are less fundamental than the interval, not to mention that intervals define paths most directly and paths are the central focus of all of homotopy theory and thus its extension to category theory. So I wanted to know: where were the interval objects in the definition of a category with weak equivalences?</p>
<p>Well anyways I looked up "interval object" on nlab and sure enough there was a <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/interval+object">real article</a> for it. But, strangely, it didn't really mention them much in the context of categorical homotopy theory. There were some mentions of if you already had a category with weak equivalences and an interval object in that, but then it started talking about "Trimble n-categories" and I have no idea what those are.</p>

<p>But that wasn't what I'm interested in: I want to know if it's possible to use interval objects as an alternative to map space and cylinder objects (or perhaps complementary to them if we're in a category with finite products) in "doing" categorical homotopy theory in a category with weak equivalences. If the answer was to be yes, then I'd need to know: given some interval object in some category, what is the canonical weak equivalence structure associated to it such that the homotopy theory generated by that interval object is the same as the categorical homotopy theory of the resulting category of weak equivalences?</p>
<p>The obvious choice is to lift the definition of "weak equivalence" straight out of Top and right into a generic category with an interval object.

<p>But axiom 2- that all homotopy groups must be isomorphic- seems harder to lift. As discussed before, you generally first need a weak equivalence structure to define a notion of homotopy and thus homotopy group, but here we have to use some notion of homotopy group to define the weak equivalences in the first place! My question is: how can this be done? And more generally, is this the best way to define a canonical weak equivalence structure for an arbitrary generic ("plain") interval object? Are there any alternatives for doing so? Thanks!</p>

<p>The general notion of cylinder allows for the cylinder to <em>not</em> be obtained by "tensoring" with some interval object, so it is taken to be more fundamental because it is strictly more general, and one can define notions of homotopy relative to any cylinder object. Dually for path objects.</p>

<p>Although if you have a monoidal structure (which could be the cartesian monoidal structure), or more generally an enrichment, then you can try to define a cylinder by tensoring with an interval, as you do in spaces.  This doesn't always work, but it frequently does.</p>

<p>But my question was two-sided. Not only did I want to get an interval out of the notion of cylinder or map space object, I wanted to "go backwards" and get to a notion of category with weak equivalences from an interval object. As suggested this might work if the category is monoidal, but I don't want to assume any additional structure, and I want to define a construction that works for all conditions no matter what.</p>

<p>Right. I had to read more on the subject, that was just my first pass take... Now from what I see a Cisinski model structure is that generated by a presheaf category equipped with some class of "anodyne extensions" as well as an "elementary homotopical datum" endofunctor. A special case of an elementary homotopical datum functor seems to be the cartesian product functor with an interval object, which is exactly what we want. I could be wrong, but the monomorphism condition, in this case, seems like it comes from the requirement that the interval object be "disjoint" in that the pullback of the two morphisms from the terminal object is the initial object. In hindsight that doesn't seem too restrictive, but I guess I was just wondering if that's as good as you can get when it comes to relaxing conditions on the interval object.</p>

<p>Heh.  In this case it's not exactly <em>knowing</em> that it won't work, but thinking it seems unlikely to give anything useful, and not having any motivating examples.  I would ask, <em>why</em> do you want to obtain a homotopy theory from just an interval object without even cartesian products?  Is there some category you're interested in that has an interval object but not cartesian products?</p>

<p>Sorry, I think I got my memory or timings confused; I should take more time writing my replies.  Looking back, I realize at the moment when I said "I guess you're out of luck then" I did think that it couldn't work.  The presheaf-category approach hadn't occurred to me.  Now I will admit that that might give something, but I'm doubtful that it'll be useful, as in my last comment.</p>

<p>Yes the Cisinski model structure is based on a "elementary homotopical datum" which itself contains the specification of a "cylinder object endofunctor" that sends an object to a cylinder object in a functorial way. But the point being made was that, given any interval object in the presheaf topos, the corresponding endofunctor <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>I</mi><mo>×</mo><mi>X</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">I \times X</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.7667em;vertical-align:-0.0833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07847em;">I</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span><span class="mbin">×</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07847em;">X</span></span></span></span> satisfies all the properties of being a cylinder object endofunctor and thus is a valid component of a elementary homotopical datum. </p>

<p>I'm not a mathematician who has to solve problems, so I don't see doing mathematical things in terms of a useful/not useful dichotomy. Instead I'm interested in these concepts as a matter of principle- I want to understand the relationships between different concepts at the deepest/most general level such relationships exist. So I suppose I'm after more of a philosophical rather than practical matter- at least in this case. Anyways I hope this gives some insight into my thought process!</p>

<p>Guhh, I am not explaining myself at all well.  I'm sorry, my brain always turns to mush during the last 2 weeks of the semster after Thanksgiving.  Probably you should just ignore everything I've said today.</p>
<p>If I can try one more time: based on my experience of a fair number of examples and theorems, I am doubtful that "categories with an interval object but without finite products or another monoidal structure" is a conceptually useful level of generality.  I don't think I've ever encountered a category like that for which the induced "homotopy theory" was interesting.  The closest thing I can think of is the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/simplex%20category">[[simplex category]]</a> which has an "interval object" <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mi><mn>1</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\Delta^1</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8141em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord">Δ</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.8141em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">1</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>, but in that case the homotopy theory we care about is really that of the presheaf category itself, not that of the domain category induced by the cylinder functor on the presheaf category.</p>

<p>Still on the subject of interval objects, it seems there's some relation between the notion of an interval object and that of a "fundamental infinity category" as detailed on <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/fundamental+%28infinity%2C1%29-category#fundamental_categories_induced_from_intervals">this nlab page</a>. However, this page mentions this subject isn't fully developed at the bottom, so I am unsure if I should accept what is written on there.</p>
<p>In any case, here are some questions I had about this: first, what is a fundamental infinity category- the highest level of "fundamental" is a fundamental infinity groupoid, right? Second, the page uses things unfamiliar to my previous study of model categories. It refers to an interval object somehow generating an operad (how does it do this?) and somehow this operad is an internal infinity category- whatever that is? I guess if I had to ask one question about this, it would be: how, precisely, does this setup tie into (and perhaps determine) a model structure on the category at hand such that this notion of "internal infinity category" can be more easily discerned by looking at the resulting infinity category for that model structure?</p>

<p>Switching gears slightly, I want to better understand modeling of higher categories in general. Starting with the base case, the nerve of any notion of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord">∞</span></span></span></span>-groupoid lands in <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">s</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">e</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{sSet}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">sSet</span></span></span></span></span> in its subcategory on Kan complexes. In the infinity category setting with the standard model structure on <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">s</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">e</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{sSet}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">sSet</span></span></span></span></span>, this nerve gives rise to an equivalence of categories between Kan complexes and infinity groupoids. Therefore, enriching in the part of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">s</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">e</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{sSet}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">sSet</span></span></span></span></span> on Kan complexes is basically the same as enriching in infinity categories, which is why these "simplicially enriched categories" are good representations of infinity categories. Moving one level up, the nerve of any notion of infinity category (that is, <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">(\infty,1)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord">∞</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord">1</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span>-category) lands in the subcategory of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">s</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">e</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{sSet}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">sSet</span></span></span></span></span> on "quasicategories", and an analogous relationship ensues between infinity categories and quasicategories to that of infinity groupoids and Kan complexes. Interestingly, one of the notions of infinity category this works for is the case of simplicially enriched categories, which allows us to view simplicially enriched categories as quasicategories that are "semi-strict".</p>
<p>I have a few resulting questions from this. First, what if, instead of enriching in <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">s</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">e</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{sSet}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">sSet</span></span></span></span></span> on Kan complexes, one weakly enriches in the full infinity category generated by the standard model structure on <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">s</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">e</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{sSet}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">sSet</span></span></span></span></span> whose objects are, essentially, all Kan complexes? Does this "weak enrichment" (analogous to how bicategories are "weakly enriched" in <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">C</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">a</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{Cat}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">Cat</span></span></span></span></span>) make the weakly enriched simplicially enriched category into a full quasicategory?

<p>Those are good questions!</p>
<p>Yes, you can get a notion of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">(\infty,1)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord">∞</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord">1</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span>-category by weakly enriching in Kan complexes.  Depending on how you formulate a notion of "weak enrichment" this might be an <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/A-infinity%20category">[[A-infinity category]]</a> or a <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Segal%20category">[[Segal category]]</a>.  These notions are different from both quasicategories and simplicially enriched categories, but are also models for <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">(\infty,1)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord">∞</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord">1</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span>-categories.</p>
<p>And yes, you can enrich in quasicategories, either strictly or weakly, to get models of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>2</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">(\infty,2)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord">∞</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord">2</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span>-categories.

However, things are not as well-behaved when you go higher than quasicategories, because while Kan complexes and quasicategories are <em>full</em> subcategories of simplicial sets, weak complicial sets are not: part of the data of a WCS is the collection of higher cells that are "equivalences", and these need not be preserved by arbitrary simplicial maps.  This is why the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/model%20structure%20for%20weak%20complicial%20sets">[[model structure for weak complicial sets]]</a> is on the category of <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/stratified%20simplicial%20sets">[[stratified simplicial sets]]</a> instead of simplicial sets.</p>
<p>Finally, I don't know offhand of anything analogous to a category with weak equivalences that can be used to present <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>2</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">(\infty,2)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord">∞</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord">2</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span>-categories.  I have a vague sense that I might have seen something like this before, like maybe categories with two different classes of "weak equivalences"?  But I can't remember what it was called or where to find it, so maybe I'm making it up.</p>

<p>A-infinity categories were actually one of the ones mentioned in the "fundamental infinity category" article I was trying to understand earlier, so I read the page for it. It seems these are only models for stable infinity categories- is that true?</p>
<p>Also, I'm curious to know of any connections or relationships between Segal categories and quasi-categories. For instance, are the two notions different because the weak enrichment "overshoots" in some capacity- that is, does it make certain properties even weaker than in a quasicategory? Or does it weaken something other than the part of a simplicially enriched category that makes it "semi-strict" over the quasicategories?</p>

<p>I was interested in this because of the analogies between Cat and homotopy theory, via the "model structure on 1-Cat". For instance I was wondering if there was any way I could put some model structure on 1-Cat to eventually get 2-Cat out of it. With just the usual model structure on 1-Cat, the best you can do is get the category of categories, functors, and natural isomorphisms between functors, not all natural transformations.</p>

<p>No, they are models of arbitrary <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">(\infty,1)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord">∞</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord">1</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span>-categories, as Mike said.  </p>
<p>The <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/A-infinity%20operad">[[A-infinity operad]]</a> is the operad that controls the coherence laws for associativity, like the the pentagon identity for the associator, the law governing the 'pentagonator' as we move up to the next rung of the ladder, and so on.  As we climb up this ladder we get all the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Stasheff%20polytopes">[[Stasheff polytopes]]</a>, which were discovered when Stasheff asked the question: what structure does a topological space get if it's equipped with a homotopy equivalence to a topological monoid?   It becomes an <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/A-infinity-space">[[A-infinity-space]]</a>, which is an algebra of the A-infinity operad.   Later this idea was used, often in the simplicial context, to develop the concept of A-infinity category.</p>

<p>Also, I'm curious to know of any connections or relationships between Segal categories and quasi-categories. For instance, are the two notions different because the weak enrichment "overshoots" in some capacity- that is, does it make certain properties even weaker than in a quasicategory? Or does it weaken something other than the part of a simplicially enriched category that makes it "semi-strict" over the quasicategories?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The two notions are not different up to homotopy: both have model structures that are Quillen equivalent.  As for why they "look" different, one way to describe it is that quasi-categories are a homotopification of the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/category#OneCollectionOfMorphisms">one set of morphisms</a> definition of category while Segal categories are a homotopification of the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/category#AFamilyOfCollectionsOfMorphisms">many sets of morphisms</a> definition of category.</p>

<p>With just the usual model structure on 1-Cat, the best you can do is get the category of categories, functors, and natural isomorphisms between functors, not all natural transformations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's true if you forget everything about 1-Cat except that it's a 1-category with a model structure.  But in fact that model structure is enriched over itself, i.e. it is a "model 2-category", and when regarded in that way it presents the 2-category of categories, functors, and all natural transformations.</p>

<p>I was interested in this because of the analogies between Cat and homotopy theory, via the "model structure on 1-Cat". For instance I was wondering if there was any way I could put some model structure on 1-Cat to eventually get 2-Cat out of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't know of such a model structure.  It's not inconceivable that it might exist, but I do see some obstacles to overcome.  For instance, there's the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Thomason%20model%20structure">[[Thomason model structure]]</a> on 1-Cat whose homotopy theory is equivalent to <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord">∞</span></span></span></span>-groupoids, where a category is defined to present the same <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord">∞</span></span></span></span>-groupoid as its simplicial nerve.  So since 2-categories also have simplicial nerves, you could try to declare that a 1-category presents the same 2-category as its simplicial nerve and get a model structure on 1-Cat that way.  But the issue of simplicial maps not preserving thin 2-cells that arose for weak complicial sets is probably going to rear its head here too, and it's not clear to me whether nerves of 1-categories would be sufficiently general to present all 2-categories.</p>

<p>I asked this as part of a tangential line of inquiry that probably should deserve its own thread. It's on the matter of the following problem: given some random 1-category, what are some of the nontrivial ways it can be extended to a 2-category with the same objects and morphisms? Obviously the classical example of a solution to this problem is the extension from 1-Cat to 2-Cat. I was hoping model structures might be a way this can be done in general (since they can extend to the infinity case, just only with all higher morphisms being equivalences), but it seems it might be a dead-end! Though I do think this is something worth following up on in the future!</p>

<p>That makes sense. But this could just be me... I prefer doing model category theory with 1-categories only. It seems almost redundant to put a model structure on a simplicially enriched category since a simplicially enriched category, all by itself, is <em>already</em> a model for an infinity category- you don't need to complicate things further by putting yet <em>another</em> model structure on top of it (when the whole point of a model category is to simplify the craziness of infinity categories)! But I guess I can see how in some cases it might be a useful shortcut to doing things with 1-categories only, as in this example.</p>

<p>For my next question, I was looking into loop space objects and noticed they were defined in an infinity category by the powering between the circle object in infinity groupoids and some object in the infinity category. The generalized elements of this space act like loops in the object. This reminded me of another thing: the "path space object" of a category with weak equivalences whose generalized elements are supposed to be interpreted as paths in an object. This made me confused: what about the object you get when you power the interval object in infinity groupoids and some object in the infinity category? </p>
<p>It can't be always true that these are the same, right? The path space object as defined by factorization of the diagonal in a category with weak equivalences becomes equivalent to its object in the infinity category setting (since the factorization must be into a weak equivalence between it and the object). If these two were to be the same, then the powering between the interval and an object in an infinity category would always have to end up equivalent to the object itself. So my question is: what is going on here? How do these two notions precisely relate to one another and which one of the two do we consider the "actual" space of paths?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>If you accept that model categories are just presentations of (certain) higher categories, then it seems a very common thing to present new algebraic structures by feeding them other algebraic structures without necessarily having to "flatten" everything to presentations. When you take a semidirect product of groups, do you insist that the definition be reduced to generators and relations of the factors?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>While I'm at it already with "dotting my I's and crossing my t's", I want to make sure that the infinity category for some category with weak equivalences is really consisting of the things that we want it to consist of. First off, in any category with weak equivalences with coproducts, we can define a notion of cylinder object and with it left homotopy (dually for categories with products, map space objects, and right homotopy). Given a left homotopy defined by a cylinder object in a category with weak equivalences (IE, by the two sided commutative triangle diagram), is it really true that it corresponds to a higher morphism in the resulting infinity category? That is, are we truly "right" to interpret the 2-morphisms of an infinity category as the homotopies as defined by the cylinder objects in a category with weak equivalences that presents it? The construction of the simplicial localization is so convoluted I haven't even begun to understand it, so I have no way of checking for myself on this!</p>
<p>Secondly, once we define a notion of homotopy (via cylinder objects in a category with weak equivalences), we can move forward and define a notion of "homotopy equivalence". This would be by the standard definition of homotopy equivalence- if two morphisms <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>:</mo><mi>A</mi><mo>→</mo><mi>B</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f: A \to B</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8889em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.10764em;">f</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">:</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">A</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">→</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05017em;">B</span></span></span></span> and <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>g</mi><mo>:</mo><mi>B</mi><mo>→</mo><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">g: B \to A</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">g</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">:</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05017em;">B</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">→</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">A</span></span></span></span> existed such that <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>∘</mo><mi>g</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f \circ g</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8889em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.10764em;">f</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span><span class="mbin">∘</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">g</span></span></span></span> is homotopic to the identity of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>B</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">B</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05017em;">B</span></span></span></span> and <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>g</mi><mo>∘</mo><mi>f</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">g \circ f</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6389em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">g</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span><span class="mbin">∘</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8889em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.10764em;">f</span></span></span></span> is homotopic to the identity of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">A</span></span></span></span>.

<p>A few days ago you mentioned that any homotopy generated with respect to one cylinder object is always equivalent to a homotopy generated by any other cylinder object, so that it doesn't end up "mattering" which one you choose. Is the same the case for the second point? That is, even if there are 2-morphisms that do not arise directly or strictly from a cylinder, that all 2-morphisms are equivalent to one that is? I think that ought to be true, in which case it "doesn't matter" if there are more 2-morphisms than the ones the cylinders generate since any such morphisms is equivalent to one that is.</p>

<p>This is certainly more confusing than I thought it'd be!</p>
<p>How about this. What if we had a category with weak equivalences, generated cylinder objects, used those to define left homotopies, used them to define homotopy equivalences, and then took all those as a "class of weak equivalences". In this way, every category with weak equivalences, through the homotopy equivalences you can define with it, induces yet another category with weak equivalences structure. I think this one should be better behaved. Of course, now it is true by definition that all homotopy equivalences are the weak equivalences. Is there any other "nice" things about this construction?</p>

<p>This setup, if it's possible, reminds me a little of the distinction between the Strom model and classical model structure on topological spaces. I can almost imagine that if you started with the classical model and its weak equivalences in Top and chose the usual cylinder object, you could rederive the Strom model structure like how I described above. And as you mentioned above, the Strom model structure is precisely the one you get by making all homotopies into the higher morphisms, and all homotopy equivalences into the actual infinity equivalences. Anyways just a thought I had!</p>

<p>If you just start with an arbitrary category with weak equivalences, and an arbitrary choice of cylinder objects, I don't think the "left homotopies" you get will satisfy any good properties like being composable or whiskerable.  In particular, therefore, the "homotopy equivalences" won't satisfy the 2-out-of-3 property to be a collection of weak equivalences.  I also don't immediately see why the cylinder objects for the original weak equivalences would also be cylinder objects for the homotopy equivalences, so it's not clear that the "homotopy equivalences" defined from the second structure would be the same as those defined from the first structure... <em>even if</em> you ignore the fact that you had to choose particular cylinder objects and the construction depended on those.</p>

<p>I think the lesson is that an arbitrary category with weak equivalences really is no good for doing "internal" homotopy theory with, using e.g. cylinders, homotopies, path objects. etc.  If you want to do that, you really need more structure like a <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/cofibration%20category">[[cofibration category]]</a> or a Quillen model structure.

Earlier, we covered that the notion of "fundamental groupoid" generalized to model categories was as a hom-groupoid in the corresponding infinity category. But it doesn't initially seem clear how the conception of a fundamental groupoid as a hom out of a model category, and the notion of fundamental groupoid presented in this nlab article, are related. So my question is: what is the precise relation between these ideas, and can one potentially be converted into the other? Thanks!</p>

<p>In the case of classical topological spaces, the "making geometric information into homotopical information" has morally already happened in the process of putting a model structure on topological spaces that considers continuous paths as the homotopies.

<p>Thanks for the in-depth answer! So it seems that the nlab page's definition works for locally connected toposes when there is some "geometric information" involved, while in other infinity toposes without this "geometric structure" the hom groupoid definition makes more sense.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I'm a little confused about what this "geometric information" actually is that somehow the homs in an infinity category can't capture but instead forget. By the Yoneda Lemma, the homs out of a category should contain all the information about the objects in the category, right? The only difference I could find between these locally connected toposes and a normal infinity topos is that they have extra structure of these functors, but this extra structure is on the category as a whole and not the objects in the category. Maybe my intuition is leading me astray here, please let me know where my reasoning is going wrong!</p>

<p>I like that term "fundamental set" - a nice case of taking a famous concept and going down to the simpler (more fundamental!) concept on which it rests, which was never exciting enough to get a cool-sounding name.  This is the sort of term James Dolan would use.</p>

<p>I'm still a little confused. A morphism from the terminal object to an object is a point in that object and the functor it represents is the underlying set functor, sure. But that's in the 1-category setting. In the infinity category setting, we have higher morphisms. For instance, if you have a homotopy (which is a higher morphism in the infinity category setting) between two functions into the same object from the terminal object, this represents a "path" in that object. Then the hom groupoid for the point sends you to the path groupoid. If you then decategorify and identify objects along equivalences, this is the same by quotienting out by homotopies. In the end, you are left with the set of all path connected components of a topological space. Maybe I'm being misled because this is in Top where the two kinds of "fundamental groupoid" converge, but it seems like the hom out of a point should still be a useful thing to consider and that it does capture geometric information about an object. In any case, this isn't to mention that you can get even richer information by using another object than the point to consider homs out of.</p>

<p>Thanks, it's good to have another example of an infinity topos other than Top (infinity groupoids) to consider things from the perspective of. In this case it's a lot like stuff, structure, property with the global sections functor as the "forgetful functor" that forgets the topological structure on the topological groupoid. But what exactly do you mean by "add new higher morphisms"? Where are these new morphisms being added to and how? (or maybe this is a metaphor I am taking too literally?)</p>

<p>Oh ok I think I understand... in the same way that a morphism from the point in Top isn't sensitive to the topological structure of a topological space, a morphism from the point- and higher morphisms between them- aren't sensitive to the topological structure of the topological groupoid. The functor <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Π</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>X</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\Pi(X)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord">Π</span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07847em;">X</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span> is sensitive to this extra structure. To be fair, this is all a little dizzying to me... infinity groupoids already act like topological spaces (CW complexes, at least) so it's hard for me to process what it means to add topological structure on top of that! Maybe this is why I like the concept of a model category so much since working with 1-categories is much less confusing than with infinity categories!</p>

<p>Moving on, now that I've been thoroughly confused by "homotopy", I want to get even more confused by cohomology. I guess I have to ask: what "IS" cohomology in general? For instance, I've seen cohomology discussed as measuring the obstruction from local to global. But does cohomology always deal with local to global, or is that just a very very special case and in general it's just some general pattern of assigning an algebraic invariant to an object?</p>

<p>When it comes to the "double structure" I think I'll just have to somehow reconcile that there's <em>two</em> notions of "homotopy" to consider depending on the situation. There's the native intrinsic homotopy from the structure of an infinity category (whose higher morphisms can be thought of as higher homotopies), and then there's "geometric homotopy" which works specifically for locally connected infinity toposes (and not for other infinity categories, though I'm sure you can consider infinity categories where the objects are groupoids equipped with extra structure but are not locally connected toposes, so no idea how homotopy is supposed to work in those cases!)</p>

<p>Wait a minute! New idea I just suddenly got! So the point we reached above is that the objects in a locally connected infinity topos are like a "doubled up" structure, and that's why the natural infinity category homotopy structure isn't sensitive to it, since it's only sensitive to the homotopy structure of the underlying groupoids. But what if that just means the homotopy construction also needs to be doubled- maybe then the "geometric homotopy" is the same as a usual homotopy, just an iterated variant.</p>
<p>Here's what I mean. First, consider some site of topological spaces used to make topological groupoids- this generates a model structure on the category of simplicial presheaves on the site. Doing the infinity category construction for this is then just generating homotopy information for the "underlying" groupoids. This gives the infinity category of topological infinity groupoids, equipped with a geometric homotopy functor <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Π</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>X</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\Pi(X)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord">Π</span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07847em;">X</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span>. A subcategory of this infinity category on its truncated objects contains many topological spaces, and the action of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Π</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>X</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\Pi(X)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord">Π</span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07847em;">X</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span> on them is the fundamental group construction for them. But wait- we could get this another way, namely as the "normal" homotopy for topological spaces. That is, we could extract this subcategory of "normal" topological spaces, add into it the homotopies from <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">T</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">o</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">p</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{Top}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8778em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">Top</span></span></span></span></span>, and then generate an infinity category <em>again</em> which then gives the usual homotopy for this selection of topological spaces.</p>

<p>So here's my "big idea". What if we took this infinity category of topological infinity groupoids and truncated it into the 1-category of topological infinity groupoids. Then, we added in a notion of "homotopy" to this 1-category, alongside a notion of homotopy equivalence, and made this a model category. This notion of homotopy obviously should coincide with the topological notion inside the subcategory containing topological spaces- for instance, maybe there's some monoidal product on the category of topological infinity groupoids and we can use this to generate cylinder objects and then the homotopies from that like in Top. Then, we use this new model structure and generate <em>another</em> infinity category from that. I'm wondering if then the geometric homotopy in the original infinity category will coincide with "normal" homotopy in this "revised" infinity category of topological infinity groupoids!</p>

<p>One can now generate another infinity category <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">H</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">o</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">m</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">I</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">n</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">f</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">T</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">o</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">p</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">G</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">r</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">p</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">d</mi></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\infty \mathrm{HomInfTopGrpd}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8889em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord">∞</span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">HomInfTopGrpd</span></span></span></span></span> (for the "infinity homotopy category of topological infinity groupoids").

<p>There won't be an actual model structure on that category, since it doesn't have 1-categorical limits and colimits.  But you may be able to give it some kind of homotopy theory.  However, I don't think it will end up coinciding with anything known.</p>

<p>Yes, if we started with <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">T</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">o</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">p</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{Top}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8778em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">Top</span></span></span></span></span> and localized at the homotopy equivalences.

This was what I was trying to illustrate above by trying to define a model structure on topological infinity groupoids. (Upon reflection I might have been able to do this more directly with simplicial model categories. In this case, just find the simplicially enriched category corresponding to the infinity category of topological infinity groupoids and add the model structure onto that simplicially enriched category directly- no need to go back down to the 1-categorical world first!)</p>

<p>Although I did find this section about "<a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/D-topological+infinity-groupoid#homotopy_localization">homotopy localization</a>" of topological infinity groupoids being equivalent to infinity groupoids- is this what you mean? If so, I'm not sure it's the same construction I'm describing- the morphisms they localize with respect to there are those of the form <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>X</mi><mo>×</mo><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><mn>0</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy="false">]</mo><mo>→</mo><mi>X</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">X \times [0,1] \to X</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.7667em;vertical-align:-0.0833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07847em;">X</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span><span class="mbin">×</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">[</span><span class="mord">0</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord">1</span><span class="mclose">]</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">→</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07847em;">X</span></span></span></span> while I want to localize with respect to the homotopy equivalences, which sounds a lot "stronger" a localization that will therefore "collapse" things a lot less. But I could be wrong about this!<br>
Edit: Oops! I guess <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>X</mi><mo>×</mo><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><mn>0</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy="false">]</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">X \times [0,1]</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.7667em;vertical-align:-0.0833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07847em;">X</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span><span class="mbin">×</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">[</span><span class="mord">0</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord">1</span><span class="mclose">]</span></span></span></span> is homotopy equivalent to <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>X</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">X</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07847em;">X</span></span></span></span> after all (at least in topological spaces), my bad... So indeed the localization of topological infinity groupoids at homotopy equivalences is likely just infinity groupoids as you suggested.</p>

<p>Ok, I went back to work on this for another hour to two, but I came up empty again. I want to move on to other topics as I still have a lot left to cover in this topic, but I at least want some resolution to this.

But I've been thinking there should also be a "homotopy functor" that would send a topological space (viewed as a discrete topological groupoid) to its underlying homotopy type. This functor would also send topological groupoids to their underlying topological space's homotopy type. Though I don't know if this functor would serve the purpose (IE, make that triangle commute) or if it even exists. What's your say?</p>

<p>So, I have a few "rapid fire" questions to wrap up this topic of learning categorical homotopy theory (and of identifying a notion of "category of spaces" in general) for now. I saved these for the end since I think they should all have quick answers (though let me know if I'm wrong!) I hope you don't mind if I put them all below:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A topos can be viewed from two perspectives: as containing generalized spaces ("big" topos) or as a generalized space ("little" topos). It would therefore make sense if (infinity) toposes were themselves to form an (infinity) topos- this topos of toposes would be a "big" topos containing generalized spaces as objects, which would therefore be toposes viewed from the "little topos" perspective. So is this true- is there any universe where toposes form a topos? And in any case, which 1-category is a good model category for the infinity category of infinity toposes?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the context of stable infinity categories, one can view the "stabilization" of an infinity category as the "category of spectrum objects" in that infinity category. If the category is a locally presentable infinity category like an infinity topos, then there's even an adjunction between the infinity category and its category of spectrum objects. On the other hand, under Isbell duality between space and quantity/geometry and algebra, one of the functors in the adjunction is called "Spec". This is meant to invoke a generalization of the "spectrum of a ring". Do these two notions of "spectrum" and their respective adjunctions have anything to do with each other, or is this just an unfortunate overuse of terminology?</p>
</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>I tried asking this question above, so here goes again. What is the basic "gist" of "cohomology" supposed to be in general? Does it always have to do with local-global correspondences (such as measuring the obstruction in a space of extending local behavior of functions defined on that space to global behavior) or is that just a very special case of cohomology? (Maybe some quick slogan for some intuition will help!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does delooping work for groupoids? So the loop space and delooping functors define an adjunction between the infinity category of pointed objects and the infinity category of monoid objects in some suitable infinity category. This makes sense for the infinity category of categories- the monoid objects in this category are the monoidal categories, and indeed the delooping functor sends the monoidal category to the one object category one level higher. However, I'm wondering how this works in the infinity category of groupoids. Sure, groups are monoidal objects in this category (and their delooping is the obvious example of a one object groupoid), but so are monoids themselves (they are monoidal objects over the discrete groupoids- in other words, over sets). So where does the corresponding delooping functor send a monoid to? Does it somehow "groupify" the monoid before sending that resulting group to its one object groupoid?</p>

<p>These are nice questions.   Some thoughts:</p>
<p>1) I'd expect the thing of all topoi to be much better described as a 2-category of some sort than as a mere 1-category, e.g. a topos.   Similarly I'd expect the thing of all <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">(\infty,1)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord">∞</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord">1</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span>-topoi to be an <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>2</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">(\infty,2)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord">∞</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord">2</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span>-category of some sort.     </p>

<p>More to your actual point: I think the meaning of "spectrum" in homotopy theory is so distant from its meaning in commutative algebra that it's bad to think they're somehow the same thing.   A spectrum in commutative algebra is a generalization of the spectrum of a self-adjoint operator which is a generalization of the spectrum of light produced by, say, a hydrogen atom.  I believe a spectrum in homotopy theory got its name simply because it was a list of topological spaces <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>X</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">X_i</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8333em;vertical-align:-0.15em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07847em;">X</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.3117em;"><span style="top:-2.55em;margin-left:-0.0785em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mathnormal mtight">i</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.15em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> with maps from the suspension of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>X</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">X_i</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8333em;vertical-align:-0.15em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07847em;">X</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.3117em;"><span style="top:-2.55em;margin-left:-0.0785em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mathnormal mtight">i</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.15em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> to <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>X</mi><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">X_{i+1}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8917em;vertical-align:-0.2083em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07847em;">X</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.3117em;"><span style="top:-2.55em;margin-left:-0.0785em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mathnormal mtight">i</span><span class="mbin mtight">+</span><span class="mord mtight">1</span></span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.2083em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>.

<p>Alternatively, we could say the point of cohomology is to simplify an object <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">x</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">x</span></span></span></span> by "stabilizing" it - making it commutative in the relevant up-to-homotopy sense.

<li>I agree with John Baez, the two uses of the word are basically unrelated.</li>
<li>There are so many different kinds of (co)homology that it's hard to give any general answer.  John Baez's is pretty good, but I'm not sure it includes literally everything that's called cohomology.</li>
<li>Delooping connects pointed objects to monoids only in the case of categories.  In the case of groupoids, it connects pointed objects to groups: as you observed, in the world of groupoids you can only deloop a group.  (There is a way of making a pointed object out of a monoid, but as you suggested it involves <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/group%20completion">[[group completion]]</a>.)</li>

<p>As for 3), I agree with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276777">@Mike Shulman</span>.  For example, once we get into "nonabelian cohomology" we are stretching the word beyond the limits of  my attempted highly general concept of cohomology: now we are studying an object by mapping it to a <em>non</em>-stable object, and the main reason we call it "cohomology" is that it can still have some of the same flavor.  It's still fun, for sure, but I think it's something new.</p>
<p>As for question 4), which I hadn't noticed: nowadays some people say the "delooping" of a monoid <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>M</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">M</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.10903em;">M</span></span></span></span> is the corresponding 1-object category <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>B</mi><mi>M</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">B M</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.10903em;">BM</span></span></span></span>.

<p>But thanks to this whole thread we finally know what a "category of spaces" actually is in full generality!

<p>Very interesting! I somewhat expected this flexibility of the word "cohomology", that is, a term to describe many similar phenomena even if it's not always possible to draw direct connections.</p>

<p>Well, if that's your notion of "category of spaces" then since any category admits a trivial model structure, <em>every</em> category is a "category of spaces".</p>

I'll sometimes think of a morphism <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>:</mo><mi>A</mi><mo>→</mo><mi>B</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f : A \rightarrow B</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8889em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.10764em;">f</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">:</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">A</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">→</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05017em;">B</span></span></span></span> as directions from <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">A</span></span></span></span> to <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>B</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">B</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05017em;">B</span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>But now is <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/point">[[point]]</a> a space?</p>
<p>If you have a board game with one piece on one square, and you're allowed to defer your move. Then yeah I think so, it's the space of the one square the piece is on.</p>
<p>But if our point is supposed to model a pebble in a set, or a point on a plane - then no I don't think it's really a space.</p>

<p>There are two things which come to mind when I think of differential geometry. There's the usual approach which is about differential and smooth manifolds. Then there's synthetic differential geometry, which takes place inside of a <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/smooth%20topos">[[smooth topos]]</a> and to me is fairly similar to algebraic geometry.</p>

<p>I'm positive they didn't have synthetic differential geometry in mind. Or at least that they inferred I was interested in the usual approach.</p>
<p>I should add they did start to understand me, and then were quick to point out "geometry" in as large as a sense I meant, wasn't a real field of study. Which was jarring for me at the time. It was a good lesson for a relatively young mathematical thinker.</p>

<p>Even if there isn't a real field of study of "geometry", there seems to be plenty of anecdotal evidence that a "geometric" approach or viewpoint or culture exists in mathematics, opposed to an "algebraic" one, with varying demographics across fields, and a visible split among algebraic geometers...</p>

<p>Well, if that's your notion of "category of spaces" then since any category admits a trivial model structure, <em>every</em> category is a "category of spaces".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, and I think that's a reflection of what I'm starting to learn in this thread. That asking "what categories are categories of spaces" isn't the right question, since the notion of "space" is way too nebulous and there's so many diverging directions of generality one could take. Instead, the right question is "how can we think of the objects of any category as spaces?" Certainly, model structures are one such answer, since obviously you can pick out many classes of weak equivalences in any category imaginable. (But obviously, I therefore now want to establish and ensure that any possible way of thinking about the objects of some category as spaces comes with a canonical associated model or weak equivalence structure, thus making these structures "the most fundamental" way of viewing a category as one of spaces)</p>
<p>Though if you have a more concrete definition of "category of space" that includes both the category of toposes as well as all gros toposes, then feel free to share it! You mentioned above that the category of toposes is "a" category of spaces, no? Would this mean you could tell the category of toposes is a "category of spaces" <em>without</em> being told what the objects of the category are supposed to represent (without being told they are toposes)? And if so, how?</p>

<p>For example, once we get into "nonabelian cohomology" we are stretching the word beyond the limits of my attempted highly general concept of cohomology: now we are studying an object by mapping it to a <em>non</em>-stable object, and the main reason we call it "cohomology" is that it can still have some of the same flavor. It's still fun, for sure, but I think it's something new.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For an account that looks to portray continuity in the passage to nonabelian cohomology, see the nLab page <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/nonabelian+cohomology">nonabelian cohomology</a>. </p>
<p>I find this story compelling, but it will always be a matter of convention whether one continues with the term 'cohomology'. Is it enough that central constructions carry over and continue to be important, such as <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/nonabelian+Poincar%C3%A9+duality">nonabelian Poincaré duality</a>?</p>
<p>I recall Colin McLarty telling me that Poincaré used unrelated terms for what we call 'group' and 'abelian group'. Ah, here it is in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-015-9558-2_18">Voir-Dire in the Case of Mathematical Progress</a></p>

But this 2-category is more akin to the Strom model than classical model structure, so then why is the fundamental infinity groupoid associated instead to the classical model?</li>
<li>Given the Strom model structure on Top and its infinity category- or its homotopy category- alone, is there any creative ways of defining a weak equivalence? I know a weak equivalence is defined in terms of isomorphisms on fundamental groups, but I was wondering if this could be simplified with knowledge of this particular infinity category or homotopy category.<br>
Thanks for your help- every time I feel I understand this subject I realize I didn't actually!</li>

<p>But don't the groupoids contain the basepoint information? After all, given some basepoint x, the fundamental group at that basepoint is the automorphism group of the object corresponding to x in the fundamental groupoid.</p>

<p>What examples do you have in mind?  This happens quite frequently in the case of "localization" and "co-localization", where we start with one model structure and make a new one by adding more weak equivalences, but in a controlled way so that the model structure shrinks the class of fibrant or cofibrant objects and on the new fibrant-cofibrant objects the homotopy theory coincides with the old one.

<ol start="3">
<li>It's "almost" the case that a map X→Y in the Strom model structure is a weak homotopy equivalence iff the induced map hom(Sn,Y)→hom(Sn,X) is an equivalence of ∞-groupoids for all n. Intuitively, maps out of Sn detect πn​. But this isn't quite true because of basepoints.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>But don't the groupoids contain the basepoint information? After all, given some basepoint x, the fundamental group at that basepoint is the automorphism group of the object corresponding to x in the fundamental groupoid.</p>

<p>This example has been known for a long time but Dan Christensen and I came back to it a few years ago and generalized it to show that <em>no</em> small class of CW complexes detects identities in the unbased homotopy category.

<p>Ok that makes more sense! I've been thinking about how to find an analogue of weak equivalences given some category with designated homotopy equivalences. Maybe one way of doing this is to find the infinity category for that system of homotopy equivalences and then use a hom-based approach to define the weak equivalences, similarly to the case when going between homotopy and weak equivalences in Top. But before I get to that I want to understand more about general "homtopy equivalences"...</p>

<p>To that extent, I came across this <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/462162/str%C3%B8m-model-structures-on-the-category-of-simplicial-sets">question from math exchange</a>. In this question, the poster defines a notion of "homtopy" between maps between simplicial sets. However, they remark that this notion of homotopy "generally fails to be either symmetric or transitive." My first question is: is this what was meant above by the following:</p>
<p><span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="276777">Mike Shulman</span> <a href="#narrow/channel/229199-learning.3A-questions/topic/What.20Are.20Categories.20of.20Spaces.3F/near/488524278">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you just start with an arbitrary category with weak equivalences, and an arbitrary choice of cylinder objects, I don't think the "left homotopies" you get will satisfy any good properties like being composable or whiskerable. In particular, therefore, the "homotopy equivalences" won't satisfy the 2-out-of-3 property to be a collection of weak equivalences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If so, then my second question is: how does the poster solve this problem? It seems they try to define an equivalence relation based off this merely reflexive relation, but I don't see what this relation is doing, nor how it retains the important information about the homotopies. They then go on to use this new relation to define a notion of "homotopy equivalence", which then makes me wonder what the higher morphisms in the resulting infinity category are (if they are not at least directly the homotopies). Any explanation of this solution is appreciated! (I'm interested in it especially because, though I don't understand it, it looks generalizable beyond simplicial sets into any category with a choice of cylinder objects, so it should always work to solve the above problem!)</p>

<p>It's worth noting that the spheres or finite complexes <em>also</em> do not detect weak equivalences in the <em>based</em> homotopy category (based spaces and based homotopy classes of maps).  Requiring based homotopies avoids these problems on the basepoint component, but you can also have other components.  Mapping out of ordinary based spheres doesn't "see" the other components at all; and if you add in some spheres with disjoint basepoints, you're back to the same problems that we had in the unbased homotopy category.</p>
<p>I think it does work in the category of <em>connected</em> based spaces, and in the category of spectra.</p>

<p>Yes, the fact that the spheres detect isomorphisms (which is sometimes called being weakly generating, and sometimes called being strongly generating...) in the connected based homotopy category is a highfalutin phrasing of Whitehead's theorem.</p>

<p>Ohhh ok. So it's like the "equivalence-relation-ification" of a relation. Kind of like if you had a category of all sets with relations, and then the subcategory of sets with equivalence relations, it's like the free functor adjoint to the inclusion of the latter into the former (whether or not that adjoint actually does exist).</p>

<p>Ok. I want to get familiar with this topic, so I want to try an example (other than simplicial sets, since that was already done). I think a category I have a somewhat good handle on is just Cat, the category of categories. Now in the standard (canonical) model structure on Cat, the interval object is the "walking isomorphism". The reason is there's an equivalence of categories (a weak equivalence in this model structure) from the walking isomorphism to the point. This makes sense since homotopies are meant to be invertible.</p>
<p>But now let's take the interval object in Cat to be the standard category interval, that is, the "walking morphism" rather than walking isomorphism. Now, if we consider "homotopies" between objects (maps into a category from the terminal category), we see they correspond to general morphisms between the objects (so a morphism is then a "path" between objects). The corresponding relation is reflexive, and unlike in simplicial sets it's also transitive due to composition of morphisms. However, it's not a symmetric relation unless our category is a groupoid, since morphisms are not in general invertible.</p>

<p>So let's consider what "completing" the equivalence relation on this relation does. At first I thought it was related to the core groupoid, but that's just the maximal sub-groupoid, and two objects can share a morphism without being in the same connected part of that groupoid. Instead, I think it's more like the "groupoidification" of a category, which would be sort of the opposite of the core- it's the minimal groupoid the category would embed into. </p>
<p>And so that's my hypothesis: that given two categories <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>C</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">C</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07153em;">C</span></span></span></span> and <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>D</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">D</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.02778em;">D</span></span></span></span>, the "best" 2-category of functors and "homotopies" between them according to using the "walking morphism" as the interval object would be the "groupoidification" of the functor category <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><mi>C</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>D</mi><mo stretchy="false">]</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">[C, D]</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">[</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07153em;">C</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.02778em;">D</span><span class="mclose">]</span></span></span></span>.

<p>Also, before we continue with the example or more examples, I want to review a few things first. <strong>1).</strong> First, what is the relation between "groupoidification" of a category: that is, the minimal groupoid with that category "contained" within it, and the localization of that category at every morphism?</p>
<p>Second, I want to avoid confusing "homotopy as a relation" with "homotopy as a multirelation", since it's the latter that is important when determining the groupoid of homotopies between two objects. Let's say you have a reflexive and transitive homotopy relation- this corresponds to a preorder, which can be viewed as a category. That means that a reflexive and transitive homotopy multirelation is just a category! (where the morphisms are homotopies- maybe this is what directed homotopy theory is about?). <strong>2).</strong> So the "equivalence relation" completion of the reflexive and transitive relation should then just be the "groupoidification" of the preorder viewed as a category. Is this right?</p>
<p>Lastly, what if the relation is merely reflexive, as in the more general case? This relation can be viewed as a directed graph, so the corresponding multirelation should be some form of directed multigraph (since transitivity = composition, so it can't be a category). But then what is the "equivalence relation completion" of this setup? <strong>3).</strong> Is it related to the "free category on a graph", or is it another kind of construction?</p>

<p>They're the same, at least, I would interpret your slightly loose description of the groupoidification as either the application of the left adjoint to the inclusion from groupoids to a category, or as the localization at all morphisms, and those are the same.</p>

<p>I assume by a "multirelation" you mean a <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/quiver">[[quiver]]</a>.

<p>Not exactly: the groupoidification of a preorder viewed as a category isn't necessarily a <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/thin%20category">[[thin category]]</a> any more, so it isn't an equivalence relation exactly.  (In fact, if memory serves, <em>every</em> groupoid can be obtained, up to equivalence, as the groupoidification of some preorder!)  The relation is in the other direction: the equivalence relation generated by a reflexive-transitive relation is the "connected components" relation <em>of</em> its groupoidification <em>qua</em> category.</p>

<p>More generally, the equivalence relation completion of any relation can be obtained by regarding the relation as a quiver, generating the free category on it as you suggest, taking the groupoidification of that, and then taking the equivalence relation of connected components.</p>

<p>They're the same, at least, I would interpret your slightly loose description of the groupoidification as either the application of the left adjoint to the inclusion from groupoids to a category, or as the localization at all morphisms, and those are the same.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks! It's interesting you mention this operation as left adjoint to the inclusion of groupoids into categories, since I also know that core groupoid construction is the right adjoint to this. When I was mentioning how the "groupoidification" is sort of like the opposite of finding the core groupoid I was speaking loosely, but it's interesting that they are "dual" to one another in a more formal sense as well!</p>

<p>I assume by a "multirelation" you mean a <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/quiver">[[quiver]]</a>. In this case, I would say morally yes,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is it odd that I think about this in terms of generalized multicategories? In this setting, given a (virtual) double category of V-matrices, a monad in it is sort of like a relation that's transitive and reflexive- for instance, a monad in the double category of relations is a preorder. To get from normal relations to multirelations, just replace truth values with sets and so the category of relations with set-matrices. A monad in that category is just a set-enriched category- a "normal" category!</p>

<p>Ok, that's mainly what I was wondering about- that is, how generalizable the "trick" I found in that math stack exchange post was. I've looked into this a bit more and I think this works even in a generic monoidal category, so long as you define an interval object to be <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">i</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">d</mi></mrow><mo>⇉</mo><mi>I</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{id} \rightrightarrows I</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8752em;vertical-align:-0.1808em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">id</span></span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel amsrm">⇉</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07847em;">I</span></span></span></span> where <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">i</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">d</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{id}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6944em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">id</span></span></span></span></span> is the monoidal identity. Of course in a cartesian category this is the terminal object. I'm guessing this also works when you start with a category of weak equivalences and define homotopies based off the cylinder objects in such a structure. So it's widely applicable!</p>

<p>Second question: Given this, what if we only cared about "completing" the homotopy relation up to being reflexive and transitive (such as with the interval object in Cat)? In essence, we are only doing the free category operation on the homotopy quiver, not the subsequent "groupoidification". Then instead of hom groupoids, we would get hom categories, and instead of hom infinity groupoids, we'd get- well, I'm not sure, would they be hom <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">(\infty,1)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord">∞</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord">1</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span>-categories, or something even higher? I believe this is called "directed homotopy theory". It makes me wonder if there's any standard way to get the <em>overall infinity</em> category where the higher morphisms are directed homotopies, maybe from a similar simplicial trick to what was discussed above?</p>
<p>In any case, this is almost reminding me of that "<a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/fundamental+%28infinity%2C1%29-category">fundamental infinity category</a> induced by an interval object" article I tried to understand a week or so ago. Maybe if this is related I can eventually work my way up to understanding it!</p>

<p>Hmmm... so your approach where you use a cosimplicial object generated from an interval is an <em>alternative</em> approach to using the homotopy equivalences generated from an interval. Though I think I now see the divergence: every interval object induces a single, unique set of homotopy equivalences, and thus there is a unique resulting infinity category structure for some choice of interval object. But in the cosimplicial object case, there can be a huge number of cosimplicial objects for which <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mi><mn>1</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\Delta^1</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8141em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord">Δ</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.8141em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">1</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> is the interval, so through this an interval object can induce a whole bunch of different infinity category structures.<br>
Though this makes me wonder about the connections between the two. Given some cosimplicial object for which <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mi><mn>1</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\Delta^1</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8141em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord">Δ</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.8141em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">1</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> is the interval, one can generate an infinity category as you described, but this also means that there's some corresponding choice of "weak equivalences" on the original category that, after simplicial localization, will produce the same infinity category. What is that class of weak equivalences?</p>

<p>This really makes me wonder about what the "correct" notion of model structure should be for directed homotopy theory. In a category with weak equivalences, the weak equivalences are meant to act as if they are the homotopy equivalences for some notion of homotopy which already satisfies reflexivity, transitivity, and symmetry. So you can only use this to generate an infinity category where all higher morphisms are invertible. So if a "category with weak equivalence" structure won't do it, what structure will?</p>

<p>Right, I'm just trying to verify that there's still ultimately only one notion of "categorical homotopy" regardless of which precise approach you take to it.

<p>I think that's a mistaken point of view, for many reasons.  Firstly, there are the same number of bicomplete categories as there are of non-bicomplete categories, namely a proper class of them.  (Ignoring size considerations.)  And while the definition of model structure is often stated using bicompleteness, actually it really only requires <em>finite</em> bicompleteness to make sense, and that was in fact Quillen's original definition.  Finally, the majority of categories that arise <em>in practice</em> where we want to do internal homotopy theory <em>are</em> bicomplete, and most of them admit either model structures or something slightly weaker like a "weak model structure".  Those that don't even admit that, usually admit at least a "one-sided" version of a model structure like a fibration category or a cofibration category.</p>
<p>There's a reason why practicing homotopy theorists use model structures all the time.</p>

<p>What do you mean? This is the whole point of a category with weak equivalences! Categories with weak equivalences, through simplicial localization, give rise to the simplicially enriched categories. More generally categories with weak equivalences give rise to any model of infinity categories, given the right notion of "localization". </p>

<p>Right, that's true. I guess when I said there's "less bicomplete categories than non-bicomplete categories" I was thinking along the lines of something like "there's less prime numbers than integers". Intuitively that seems true but formally there's the "same number" of primes as integers (countable infinity).</p>

<p>The problem is that "directedness" is a pretty vague thing.  Higher categories are "directed" in one precise sense, but it's not at all clear whether there's a notion of "direction" one can impose on a topological space that means the same thing.</p>

<p>I want to take a break from model structures and homotopy theory to return to a discussion above about categories of sheaves. In a previous thread, I learned about two notions of establishing some notion of "space": a relation of some sort between parts of a space, and as the "gluing together" of parts of a space. Things like (V,T) algebras abstract the former and sheaves abstract the latter. At the end of that discussion, I asked if the "gluing way" of looking at things could be encapsulated by the "relation way", but the answer was that this was not possible in general, since you can't specify <em>how</em> parts glue together with just a relation. But on further reflection, maybe I had it the wrong way, and I should <em>instead</em> have asked if the "relation way" could be encapsulated by the "gluing way"!</p>
<p>Indeed, there's many examples of something like this. The most obvious example is the "<a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Johnstone%27s+topological+topos">topological topos</a>", which aims to include as many kinds of space as possible such as all subsequential spaces, though in a misleading twist it doesn't include all topological spaces. The notion of the quasi-topological space would be a sheaf construct that does include all topological spaces, but the starting site is so "big" that it's not very useful to consider. On the other hand, primarily due to the small size of its site, the example of the topological topos gives a perfect opportunity to understand the relationship between the "relation way" and "gluing way" of looking at spaces, since its objects can be understood through both.</p>

<p>First, you can view the objects in the topological topos (at least, the subsequential spaces) as being defined via a relation: a binary relation between the set of sequences and the set of points that satisfy some properties. Importantly, as the nlab says, a general object can be thought of as a subsequential space "such that a given sequence can converge to a given point in 'more than one way'." On the other hand, you can view them in terms of gluing- they are the "gluing together" of objects on the defining site, which consist of the point and the "one point compactification" of the natural numbers. No doubt the fact both definitions involve the natural numbers (sequences are defined in terms of natural numbers, and the gluing uses a space of natural numbers) provides a connection between the two. But my question is: what is the specifics of the connection? More concretely: How can I go between viewing the objects of this topos from the relation sense to the gluing sense and back?</p>

<p>I have a different question about the topological topos. The implicit restriction to topological spaces whose topology is determined by saying which <em>sequences</em> converge to which points is sad - at least to a former analyst such as myself.   In functional analysis we routinely deal with spaces where this isn't true!  So, we use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_(mathematics)">nets</a>, a generalization of sequences where the indexing set <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="double-struck">N</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{N}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6889em;"></span><span class="mord mathbb">N</span></span></span></span> is replaced by an <em>arbitrary</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_set">directed set</a>.</p>
<p>Has anyone tried to build something like the topological topos where we replace the role of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="double-struck">N</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{N}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6889em;"></span><span class="mord mathbb">N</span></span></span></span> by an arbitrary directed set?  Not a <em>fixed</em> directed set, that's probably easy, but that doesn't solve the problem!     We need to let it vary.   </p>
<p>(In analysis we put no bound on the cardinality of the directed set, and I can imagine that causing problems somehow, but in practice, for the spaces we actually care about, it's probably enough to work with nets whose cardinality is bounded.  I haven't actually checked, but you should be able to get away using the maximum cardinality of the collection of open subsets in the spaces you're interested in.)</p>

<p>In an interesting twist, I was actually thinking of this and was going to ask a similar question to it once I understood the simpler example with the topological topos! But if you can replace the natural numbers with a fixed directed set, then maybe the solution is just to add in <em>all</em> the directed sets (though you would have to choose whether or not to include morphisms between the directed sets instead of just considering the ones from the point)</p>

<p>I suppose, but I wouldn't even know where to start! For instance, the notion of "convergence" makes sense from the relation standpoint- in fact, the relation is literally describing convergence! But I don't see exactly what the interpretation of "convergence" is in the sheaf picture. In addition, a sequence is just a map from the natural numbers to some set, and this is easily encapsulated in the relation picture where one of the sets is the set of sequences for some set. But where does the notion of "sequence" come from in the sheaf picture? I understand the set of natural numbers is an object in the site, but where's the map from it to some other set when there is no "other set" in the site?</p>

<p>I don't think anyone has managed to make exactly this work, but the theory of condensed/pyknotic sets is very similar and serves a lot of the same purposes.  I learned at <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/q/441610/49">https://mathoverflow.net/q/441610/49</a> that these topoi satisfy many of the same good properties as Johnstone's topological topos.  Informally, the idea is to generalize even further: instead of just considering the 1-point compactifications of nets in the site, you include more general compacta.</p>

<p>As for the "patching", I think I can see how that works a bit better now. You can imagine an object in the topological topos as being a whole bunch of convergent sequences patched together.

So you are literally building up a space from sequences!</p>

<p>As for the next thing I want to understand, it's the axioms. The relation defining a subsequential space has three axioms: centrality, isotonicity, and the "star property" (which works like the one for pseudotopological spaces). Meanwhile, on the "gluing" side, a sheaf is a presheaf satisfying the gluing condition. How do these two work together? For instance, what kind of "space" do you get when you just look at presheaves on this site, and what happens when the sheaf condition is then imposed?</p>

<p>I did some more work on this and I came across an interesting connection. I first wanted to simplify the problem further by considering a "topos of preorders". This would work just like Johnstone's topos, but instead of being based on relations between a set of sequences and the set of points they can converge to, it's based on relations between a set and itself- essentially asking which point another point in the set "converges to". To construct this, I started with Johnstone's site and replaced the natural numbers with a two element space (IE, a "one point compactification" of the point itself, if that makes any sense). That way, in the resulting topos, every morphism from this representable into a space will correspond to a point and another point that the first one "converges to". </p>
<p>Then I thought that if this topos was anything like Johnstone's topos, then there'd be more than one way a point can "converge" to another point. I then came to a sudden realization that this just sounds like quivers ("multigraphs"). And I actually think that's what I was describing all along! If a site consisted of just a point and a 2 element space, then it consists of two objects and two morphisms from one to the other- which happens to exactly be the "walking graph"! The two point space, as a representable, can then be interpreted to be a generic edge in a graph. If this is all correct, then Johnstone's topos is really just an "extension" of the idea behind the quiver topos.</p>

<p>I'm glad I'm understanding this a bit better! It's also interesting how this (inadvertently) ties into the earlier discussion we were having on "multirelations". In a sense, then, the objects of the topological topos are like a "multirelation" version of subsequential spaces. Maybe there's even a fun way to think about this in terms of generalized multicategories, like trying to define objects of the topological topos in terms of a monad on Set-Matrices that sends a set to its set of sequences.</p>

<p>I've been summoned! It seems like people are talking about the topological topos? I can say some words about that, if there's questions ^_^.

<p>No problem! For a quick summary I'm trying to use the topological topos as an example to understand the connection between defining spaces (and "locality") through binary relations (such as the relation between the set of sequences of a set and the set itself) and through "gluing" (such as "gluing together" convergent sequences to generate objects of the topological topos).</p>

<p>What I found interesting in the nlab article on the category of quivers is that, if a quiver is thought of as a multirelation, then a separated presheaf (with respect to the double negation topology on the walking quiver) is a normal relation. I guess my next thing to wonder is if this carries over in general. For instance, consider some equivalent of the double negation topology on the site defining the topological topos. Would a separated presheaf with respect to this topology be a true relation (so there's at most one way a sequence can converge to a point)?</p>
<p>If so, consider this. A "bisheaf" is a sheaf with respect to one topology and a separated presheaf with respect to another- consider a bisheaf that is a sheaf with respect to the typical topology on the site and a separated presheaf with respect to the "double negation". As with any bisheaf, the category of such is a quasitopos known as a "Grothendieck quasitopos". Coincidentally, the category of subsequential spaces is also a quasitopos. Is it possible these are one in the same?</p>

<p>Here's something else I'm wondering about- is the double negation topology on the walking quiver the only topology on the walking quiver? After all there's only two morphisms, so it makes sense that it is. But if so, the only sheaves on the walking quiver are "total relations". So there wouldn't be a way to define preorders directly in terms of sheaves on some site... (unlike with subsequential spaces, whose relation satisfies similar same axioms as a preorder, just with a different set involved in the relation)</p>

<p>I guess I'm not sure exactly what you mean by a "true relation", since I missed a fair amount of discussion. But I can tell you that Mike is right to say this is in Johnstone's original paper. Indeed thm 3.6 shows that objects of the topological topos which are sheaves for the double negation topology are exactly the indiscrete spaces (i.e., every sequence converges to every point). The objects that are merely separated for the double negation topology are exactly the kuratowski limit spaces (sometimes called subsequential spaces). These have the property it sounds like you want where each (sequence, limit point) pair has a unique "witness" to its convergence.</p>

<p>With all this covered, I actually want to create a true "topological topos". A topological space can be defined in terms of convergence as a binary relation between a set of ultrafilters and the set itself. While Top is not a quasitopos and so topological spaces cannot be expressed directly as bisheaves, if one relaxes the axioms of the binary relation between the ultrafilters and the set, it will give the notion of "pseudotopological spaces", which do happen to form a quasitopos. So let's try and find the topos that contains the pseudotopological spaces (and thus the topological spaces).</p>
<p>If we try to do this straightforwardly following from the example of the topological topos, we need to replace the natural numbers with the "ultrafilter space". Then, we can do a one point addition (or compactification) of this space, and use that as the basis of our site. In the resulting presheaf category, every morphism from the corresponding representable to a pseudotopological space will select an ultrafilter and a point that ultrafilter converges to, just like with sequences in the topological topos. We can then think of both topological and pseudotopological spaces as sets of ultrafilters that have been "glued together". </p>
<p>That's all well and good, but when I looked onto nlab on the page "quasitopos", it mentions explicitly that pseudotopological spaces are not Grothendieck quasitopos while subsequential spaces are. This means, apparently, that they cannot be expressed as bisheaves, such as those that are sheaves with respect to the standard topology on my site and separated with respect to the double negation topology on this site. But this doesn't make any sense- I just replicated exactly what you can do for subsequential spaces over for pseudotopological spaces. Can someone explain what is going on?</p>

<p>This does make me wonder a bit about the relation between two of Grothendieck's "things": his toposes and his universes. Let's say you have a large site (such as the site of nets); the presheaf category will not be a topos since, in a sense, the category is "too big" to be a topos. But what if you were then to enlarge your category of sets a universe or so up, to get from <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">e</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{Set}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">Set</span></span></span></span></span> to <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">E</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">T</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{SET}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">SET</span></span></span></span></span>? Now all of a sudden, the category somehow becomes a topos, right? But what I don't understand is how the property of being a topos somehow depends on the universe you are using to look at the category, rather than anything intrinsic to the category. After all, the definition of a topos seemingly makes no reference to size: it has finite limits (which are finite no matter which universe you are working in), is cartesian closed, and has a subobject classifier. Which of these somehow depends on the size of the universe you are working in?</p>

<p>Ok, with that settled, then how do Grothendieck quasitoposes work? Let's say you have two site structures on a large category and you have some notion of "bisheaf" for these sites. This forms a subcategory of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><msup><mi>C</mi><mrow><mi>o</mi><mi>p</mi></mrow></msup><mo separator="true">,</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">E</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">T</mi></mrow><mo stretchy="false">]</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">[C^{op}, \mathrm{SET}]</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">[</span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07153em;">C</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.6644em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mathnormal mtight">o</span><span class="mord mathnormal mtight">p</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">SET</span></span><span class="mclose">]</span></span></span></span> on the bisheaves. How does this category appear when we go back down to looking at <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">e</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{Set}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">Set</span></span></span></span></span>? In other words, does the Grothendieck-ness of a quasitopos depend on the size scale? I think it does since the notion of "generating set" depends on your notion of "set", which itself depends on the size. So if that's the case, then that brings up a second question: given some non-Grothendieck quasitopos, is there any way to tell if it is a Grothendieck quasitopos, just with respect to some larger universe?</p>

<p>You could just apply the standard Giraud theorem for quasitoposes at the larger universe.</p>
<p>But if the quasitopos you're thinking of is something like pseudotopological spaces, this is not going to happen, because a Grothendieck (quasi)topos in some universe is complete and cocomplete for that universe, whereas ordinary Set-large categories like groups, rings, and (pseudo)topological spaces are only Set-complete, not SET-complete.</p>

<p>Ok, so then what would be the exact step by step instructions for deriving the category of pseudotopological spaces using the sheaf method?

<p>As I said essentially to John Baez above, I don't think this is something that's been successfully done before, so you are treading new ground!  Your sketch sounds reasonable.  It's not immediately obvious that it will be possible to define a "net topology" with the right properties, but you should try!  It's also not immediately obvious to me that the separation topology you want will be the double-negation one, although there's a reasonable chance.  In the last step, you'll want to restrict to the bisheaves that are valued in Set rather than SET; <em>a priori</em> this doesn't preserve anything useful, but in this case we know that PsTop is a quasitopos, and presumably its structure will turn out to be induced by PSTOP.</p>

<p>I do think this is something reasonable to consider, since it always helps to have multiple perspectives on something. While the (T, V) algebra and relation perspective is powerful, thinking about things in terms of sheaves instead allows one to put notions of "space" and notions of "manifold" that you can build from spaces on the same footing. Perhaps eventually that could be used to derive a complete concrete definition of "space" that includes both topological-esque and manifold-esque spaces (and also therefore a unifying notion of "locality", which is what I eventually want to discover). In any case, this analysis also serves as a way of generalizing the correspondence between graphs and relations beyond the usual setting.</p>

<p>Ok, well I looked into it a bit more and I think that notion of "small object" was actually the way to go. An object is a "<span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>k</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">k</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6944em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03148em;">k</span></span></span></span>-small/compact object" for some cardinal <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>k</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">k</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6944em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03148em;">k</span></span></span></span> if it preserves a certain kind of colimit (a filtered colimit) of size <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>k</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">k</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6944em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03148em;">k</span></span></span></span>. This is also related to ind-completion: the category of finite sets can be ind-completed into <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">e</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{Set}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">Set</span></span></span></span></span>, in which the original finite sets can be viewed as the compact objects with respect to this completion.</p>
<p>My guess is that an ind-completion acts as the categorical generalization of a universe enlargement. So if I ind-complete <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">e</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{Set}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">Set</span></span></span></span></span>, then I'd get the category <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">E</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">T</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{SET}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">SET</span></span></span></span></span> where the original sets are "compact objects" with respect to this ind completion. Thus going back to the original example, the objects in <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">P</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">S</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">T</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">O</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">P</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{PSTOP}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">PSTOP</span></span></span></span></span> which are pseudotopological spaces would be the "compact objects" in this category.</p>
<p>I hope that at least makes some sense!</p>

<p>Hmmm... well while I work more on that idea, I want to share another thing I've also been working on (my apologies if this is a lot of text!): extending the graph-relation connection to more obscure forms of relations- for instance, metric spaces. A metric space can be thought of as a relation, not indexed by the set of truth values, but rather indexed by the set of real numbers. More generally, as we learned in the discussion on (T,V)-algebras, we can index a relation by any quantale V. My question is: how can we fit this in with our discussion of relations vs gluings?</p>
<p>I've thought about this for a bit and have a few basic ideas. My first is that instead of having a site with a point and one other object, we have a site where the objects other than the point are indexed by some element of the quantale. For example, if we let the quantale be the real numbers, then every site object (and thus representable in the topos) will be a "ball" of some real number size around whatever it is we are studying convergence of (a point, sequence, net, etc.)</p>
<p>As an example, let's consider "subsequential approach spaces" which are exactly the same as subsequential spaces, except instead of a binary relation between sequences and points, it's a real number indexed relation- that is, there's a distance function assigning a real number "distance" between a sequence and a point. Our site may consist of the point and a whole bunch of copies of something like the one point compactification of the natural numbers, one for each real number.</p>

<p>Now, let's go to the sheaf topos and find the representable corresponding to the real number 3. A morphism from this representable will do the same thing as in the topological topos- pick a sequence and a point that the sequence converges to. But here, a sequence from the representable for 3 only "converges" to a point if the "distance" between the sequence and the point is less than or equal to 3. In other words, we can think of each morphism from a representable as a sequence "surrounded" by a ball of some radius that only exhibits a convergence to some point if that point is in the radius of the ball.</p>
<p>The site itself should actually look like the poset of real numbers, in decreasing order. In the resulting topos, this ordering of the representables is important. For instance, if the "distance" between a sequence and a point is 3 in some space, then there will be a corresponding morphism from the 3 representable to that space. But there should then be a corresponding morphism from any representable greater than 3 as well since we want a sequence to converge to a point so long as the "ball" around the sequence encloses the point. The decreasing ordering gives us that through composition- for instance, there's a morphism from 4 to 3, and so composing with the one from 3 to the space gives us the corresponding map from 4 to the space we want. A contravariant functor on this site representing some space sends an object for some real number to the set of pairs of sequences and points such that the distance function for the space assigns a value less than or equal to that real number. This creates a chain of functions of sets now in increasing order (due to contravariance) that sends pairs of sequences and points to themselves within the more expanded ball/scope.</p>
<p>Anyways, I have no idea if this idea is good or not. Let me know what you would do if asked to extend the discussion we've been having to general quantales!</p>

<p>That analysis was to solve the relation-graph correspondence for (T, V)-algebras halfway (the V part namely). But there's still the T part, which will ultimately determine the category and site we want to consider. To this extent, I want to find some sort of machinery that takes in a monad on Set and spits out some site such that the category of sheaves on that site will correspond in a nice way to relations from the monad to sets. For instance, given the identity monad on Set, this machinery will produce the walking quiver; given the sequence monad on Set, this machinery will produce the site for the topological topos; and given the net monad on Set, this machinery will produce the net site we've been discussing above.</p>
<p>However, I'm much less confident on how to find the solution to this problem than with the analysis given above. I know that monads do correspond to categories, finite product categories to be specific (and if you have a finitary monad, it corresponds to a special finite product category known as a Lawvere theory), but I'm not sure how or even if the information we need can be extracted from the finite product category corresponding to the monad. Do you know of any construction that would do this? If not, would you at least know if there's anything you can do to the identity monad on Set to get something like the walking quiver? Anything would help!</p>

<p>That's not really true, right?  Or is there some theorem here I don't know?  Maybe you're deliberately talking in a loose and hand-wavy way here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(and if you have a finitary monad, it corresponds to a special finite product category known as a Lawvere theory)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's right (for a finitary monad on Set).</p>

<p>It's true that every monad on Set can be represented by a certain sort of "infinitary Lawvere theory", right?  Although that's not a <em>finite</em> product category but an infinitary product category.</p>

<p>Yes, I misspoke (or mis-typed?) I meant to say "monads correspond to product categories", not "finite product categories". My mistake!</p>

<p>For instance, I was reading about ultrafilters in <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/ultrafilter#ultrafilters_and_unbiased_boolean_algebras">this section</a> where apparently there's a way to make ultrafilters representable in a similar way to making sequences representable with the topological topos site. Though I'm not sure if there's any significant connection there, it's just something I noticed.</p>

<p>With all this covered, I actually want to create a true "topological topos". A topological space can be defined in terms of convergence as a binary relation between a set of ultrafilters and the set itself. While Top is not a quasitopos and so topological spaces cannot be expressed directly as bisheaves, if one relaxes the axioms of the binary relation between the ultrafilters and the set, it will give the notion of "pseudotopological spaces", which do happen to form a quasitopos. So let's try and find the topos that contains the pseudotopological spaces (and thus the topological spaces).</p>
<p>If we try to do this straightforwardly following from the example of the topological topos, we need to replace the natural numbers with the "ultrafilter space". Then, we can do a one point addition (or compactification) of this space, and use that as the basis of our site. In the resulting presheaf category, every morphism from the corresponding representable to a pseudotopological space will select an ultrafilter and a point that ultrafilter converges to, just like with sequences in the topological topos. We can then think of both topological and pseudotopological spaces as sets of ultrafilters that have been "glued together". </p>
<p>That's all well and good, but when I looked onto nlab on the page "quasitopos", it mentions explicitly that pseudotopological spaces are not Grothendieck quasitopos while subsequential spaces are. This means, apparently, that they cannot be expressed as bisheaves, such as those that are sheaves with respect to the standard topology on my site and separated with respect to the double negation topology on this site. But this doesn't make any sense- I just replicated exactly what you can do for subsequential spaces over for pseudotopological spaces. Can someone explain what is going on?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="673117">@John Onstead</span> Here are some facts that might be of interest to you. (I haven't followed every detail of this discussion, so I apologise if these facts have already been mentioned somewhere.) </p>
<ol>
<li>The category of pseudotopological spaces forms the quasitopos hull of the category of topological spaces (caveat emptor: there might be size issues to be considered here, as already noted in this thread). See 70.2 of <em>Lecture notes on topoi and quasitopoi</em> by Wyler. </li>
<li>As explained in Wyler, this follows from a theorem due to Day and Kelly which I cite here: <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/2768503/296267">https://math.stackexchange.com/a/2768503/296267</a> </li>

<p>Thus, the quasi-topos hull of the category of topological spaces is given by the category of concrete sheaves w.r.t. the "smooth topology" on topological spaces. (N.B., in AG the smooth topology gives the same sheaf topos as the étale topology. A surjective map between sequential topological spaces is étale in this sense iff the lifts of the tails of the converging sequences are unique (possibly after restricting the tails a bit further). I don't know whether this gives the same Grothendieck topology as the "smooth" topology for topological spaces.)</p>

<p>I hadn't heard of a quasitopos hull before, but it looks interesting! From what I can see so far it's something that's defined in terms of categories topological over Set (which is one of the kinds of "categories of spaces" I'm interested in!)</p>

<p>Thus, the quasi-topos hull of the category of topological spaces is given by the category of concrete sheaves w.r.t. the "smooth topology" on topological spaces.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's quite interesting to note! I'll certainly be thinking about this more...<br>
Though, I will mention that in the above discussion when trying to define spaces in terms of sheaves, I wanted to avoid using Top to do so, since- and this could just be me- it would feel "circular" to do so. While the "site of nets" discussed was a large category, its objects are not spaces so I guess I was still ok with using them to "build up" spaces.</p>

<p>In any case, I have a lot to think about over the holidays... I'm not sure how active I will be on here over the next two weeks (also since I don't know how active this server will be anyways). I might post here or there but I think I will end this present discussion- it's been very engaging and I sure learned a lot (to think, a few weeks ago I had no idea anything about categorical homotopy theory or what infinity categories had to do with it...) </p>
<p>But don't worry I'll be back in the new year with a whole bunch more hopefully engaging topics! One of my New Year resolutions is to finally solve what "locality" is in general in terms of category theory, and I think that will go smoothly now that I know a lot more about all the different kinds of "space" and ways "spaces" are handled in category theory. On the more concrete side of things, I also eventually want to return to the gauge theory discussion and see fiber bundles in action in describing all sorts of physical situations. In any case, enjoy the holidays and I will be sure to return to continue these interesting discussions soon!</p>

<p>It's true that every monad on Set can be represented by a certain sort of "infinitary Lawvere theory", right?  Although that's not a <em>finite</em> product category but an infinitary product category.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm scared of "monads without rank", i.e. monads that correspond to algebraic structures that crucially involve arities that are arbitrarily large cardinals, like <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/infinitary+algebraic+theory">suplattices</a>.   The link seems to suggest that those are okay too, but I haven't put time into understanding it.   (It says that some things haven't been proved yet, but those may be irrelevant to the conversation here.  It also states a <strong>Conjecture</strong> followed by a bunch of lemmas that seem to be aiming at a proof.)</p>

<p>Has anyone tried to build something like the topological topos where we replace the role of N by an arbitrary directed set?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't think anyone has managed to make exactly this work, but the theory of condensed/pyknotic sets is very similar and serves a lot of the same purposes.  I learned at <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/q/441610/49">https://mathoverflow.net/q/441610/49</a> that these topoi satisfy many of the same good properties as Johnstone's topological topos.  Informally, the idea is to generalize even further: instead of just considering the 1-point compactifications of nets in the site, you include more general compacta.</p>

<p>I should also have linked to <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/q/441838/49">https://mathoverflow.net/q/441838/49</a>.</p>
<p>Happy new year everyone!</p>
