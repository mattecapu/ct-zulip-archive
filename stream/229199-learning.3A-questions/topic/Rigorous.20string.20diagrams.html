<p>I think I've said it before, but I really don't think Joyal-Street is what "makes string diagrams rigorous". JS is a kind of local-to-global result saying that any such-and-such isotopy is sound for such-and-such monoidal categories, which means that it can be factorised into individual steps which are applications of the axioms of these monoidal categories. <br>
But nobody gives diagrammatic proofs which are big complicated transformations all done at once! That would be unintelligible. Usually they are done in small steps where you can see with little work the individual axioms being applied. For the soundness of those there is no need for JS at all.</p>

<p>In general the result you use is "this class of diagrams (modulo bla bla bla) form the free wotsit on these generators". That makes it analogous to the corresponding result for 1d syntax, that strings on an alphabet form the free monoid</p>

<p>I'm sorry, what are the precise statements/qualms? From what I understood (colloquially---I have not read the paper in detail), JS show that given a decomposition of two morphisms in a hom-set of some symmetric monoidal category, these two morphisms are equal if and only if their corresponding graphs associated to those decompositions are isotopic. Or did they not actually prove this? Or is there some issue in some of these definitions?</p>

<p>I disagree that Joyal-Street is analogous to “strings on an alphabet form the free monoid”. In the "free monoid" case you are passing from something quotiented by an equivalence relation to something free. In JS you are passing from something quotiented by an equivalence relation to something quotiented by a huge space of transformations. The “hard side” is the opposite.</p>

<p>Hi Arthur, there's absolutely no issues about what Joyal-Street proved, nor with the fact that it's a great paper :) <br>
The disagreement is about whether string diagrams need a Joyal-Street-type theorem to be “rigorous”. I do not think so.</p>

<p>Isn't it taken as given that rearranging symbols on a page in principle does give rise to a bijection? Similarly to how string diagram manipulations in principle give rise to an isotopy? So in both cases, the theorem is necessary if you want to be fully rigorous, but not sufficient for formal proof.</p>

<p>Well, it relies on being able to do at least one of the following two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write down an "honest proof" -- by which I assume you mean a direct application of the axioms;</li>
<li>Write down an actual isotopy (say, by a formula), and then check a long list of conditions (e.g., that it really is an isotopy, and carries one of the diagrams you're claiming equal onto the other one, and preserves directedness of the "wires" at all intermediate times, etc.), and then apply the Joyal-Street theorem.</li>

<p>Here is another perspective. The Joyal-Street theorem is a theorem about real numbers and continuous functions. As such, it seems plausible that it uses some fact about continuous functions (like the intermediate value theorem) which is true classically but not in all constructive settings. Suppose for the sake of argument that it actually does use such a fact. Would you conclude that proofs by string diagram are valid classically but not constructively?</p>

<p>I agree with this, but also claim the following: if we were to convince an outsider of the rigour of string diagrams, we would point them to Joyal-Street. It's reasonable to expect a general mathematician to reproduce an isotopy from pictures, in a similar process to how they will reproduce a proof from a typical written proof. It's less reasonable to get them to learn how to reproduce monoidal category equations from pictures from first principles.</p>

<p>By the way, there's a different issue which is the possibility of interpreting a diagram (prior to any quotient) univocally in some model. That's called a "pasting theorem" and it is indeed necessary to make diagrammatic reasoning rigorous! In 2D for monoidal categories, however, it is simple enough once you have Mac Lane's coherence theorem.</p>

<p>I'm not sure why the first stance should be disparaged.

<p>As long as one isn't writing machine-checkable proofs, the difference between an "honest proof" and a recipe for one seems to be largely a matter of taste/familiarity/convention. So if/when everyone involved is used to string diagrams, they arguably are honest proofs in the same sense that ordinary (non-machine checkable) mathematical proofs are. One could also ask what's the "underlying proof" of the proof you get once you've replaced the string diagrams with say equations - there's still probably all kinds of stuff left implicit.</p>

<p>I am mildly amused by this discussion, since I believe everyone involved can agree that string diagrams are a valid/sufficiently rigorous method of proof (be it in themselves or as diagrammatic representations of some other formalism), while on the other hand any of the absent people who have made the argument that they <em>aren't</em> rigorous are more likely to have done so out of ignorance than from any evidence. It might be surprising to the uninitiated that string diagrams can be rigorous, because they are so different in form to the symbolic manipulation that they are used to. Yet, even in cases where they are being used as a calculus for some formal system which they haven't been proven to be a completely sound model of (by which I mean, a situation in which there could be some operation on a string diagram which is possible but doesn't represent a valid transformation on the formal system side), the 'potential for a step-by-step translation to "honest proof"' comes from an implicit proof of soundness of <em>particular</em> operations on the string diagrams, which therefore validate the string diagram calculations directly <em>in situ</em>.</p>

<p>Yes, I think this is an interesting fault line.  Are diagrams just a thing from which you can recover an "honest proof", or can we call diagrammatic proofs "honest proofs"?    </p>
<p>One could ask the same question for the usual proofs mathematicians write in papers.  Are they just things from which you can recover an "honest proof" based on syntactically manipulating axioms the way a proof assistant would, or are they "honest proofs"?</p>
<p>I have no strong opinion about these questions.  I tend to treat mathematics as a human activity, with a proof being a method of convincing other people that something is true.   So, to me a written argument, or a series of pictures, or a verbal argument counts as an "honest proof" if the person it's addressed to understands it.... which in part means being able to fill in more detail if it's demanded.</p>
<p>This is a somewhat old-fashioned attitude now that a lot of people are dreaming of the day when people become somewhat obsolete and computerized mathematics is what counts as "honest" proof.   But I don't care - if and when that day ever comes, I'll be doing something else: perhaps composing music, perhaps pushing up daisies.</p>

<p>So, I'll start with some slight pedantry: Joyal-Street is not a coherence theorem.<br>
A coherence theorem is a statement that “certain types are contractible” to use HoTT-jargon. Or “certain sets are singletons” in more classical cases. For example, Mac Lane's coherence for monoidal categories is the statement that “all hom-sets are singletons” in the free monoidal category on a set of objects, where the “theory of monoidal categories” is presented in the usual way by pentagon+triangle equations.<br>
Joyal-Street is a more traditional “soundness and completeness” theorem (the axioms of (S)MCs are sound and complete for a certain isotopy relation between certain diagrams).</p>

<p>As it is the two are independent. Without Mac Lane's coherence J-S would still be a valid theorem about <em>strict</em> monoidal categories. Coherence extends it to general monoidal categories, because it provides a <em>pasting theorem</em> for general monoidal categories, in the sense that I mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>Now to answer your question: <br>
I think that the lack of a <em>coherence theorem</em> can very easily lead to wrong diagrammatic proofs, where the error would lie before any manipulations are actually applied, at the level of “lack of a pasting theorem”.</p>

<p>There's a certain limited but extremely important use of calculi of all sorts (diagram languages, logics, etc.), which is to show that things <em>are equal</em>, and for this soundness is enough.  From this point of view, completeness is mainly to reassure ourselves that "we're not missing any tricks".</p>

<p>Ok, this makes total sense. Soundness allows you to do diagrammatic proofs of equality. Completeness allows you to do diagrammatic proofs of non-equality, either by eyeballing or by finding some geometric invariant that can distinguish your 2 diagrams</p>

<p>String diagrams and wiring diagrams are closely related in that both represent composites of morphisms in a monoidal category. The main difference is that string diagrams, in the sense of Joyal and Street, are <em>geometric</em> objects inhabiting two, three, or four dimensional space, whereas wiring diagrams are <em>combinatorial</em> objects not embedded in space. So, as a rough analogy, wiring diagrams are to string diagrams as graphs are to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_graph_theory">geometric graphs</a>. The geometric perspective on string diagrams gets center stage in Selinger's survey of graphical languages, which talks a lot about isotopy of diagrams.</p>

<p>Reason for asking: we decided to use that type of diagram as our standard way to document resource flows  in economic networks, as you can see here: <a href="https://github.com/valueflows/valueflows/issues/507">https://github.com/valueflows/valueflows/issues/507</a> (which includes that diagram, if you are not familiar with it, but I expect you are...)</p>
<p>We were inspired by that and other similar diagrams, and thought they were called string diagrams. But our diagrams are usually not embedded in space, they are more abstract diagrams of the directions, sources, and destinations of flows of resources by resource type. But we also cite applied category theory as the source of the diagramming format, and would like to call them by the correct name.</p>

<p>I don't know the right terminology was this (and until this morning I wasn't aware that there was any candidate terminology). Personally I use "string diagram" to refer to both the geometric and combinatorial version, same as eg. I use "simplex" to refer to both the geometric and combinatorial version.

<p>I think one thing to _really_ keep in mind is that "string diagrams = graphical calculus for some flavor of <strong>free</strong> category". Freeness is a very nice property: A free object of some sort can be thought of as the most general object of its kind, and as such it can always be mapped to other object of the same kind quite effortlessly.</p>

<p>This means that when you use string diagrams, you get a very easy way to build functors mapping your morphisms to other similar cats. I am not an expert of the operadic formalism, but I don't know if this still holds in that setting. Personally, freeness is exactly what makes string diagrams useful for my research. String diagrams are also the preferred graphical formalism, by a great measure, both in categorical quantum mechanics and in categorical linguistics.</p>

<p>Even if you accept this distinction, you could call it either and people would understand what you mean. Although there are significant differences between the combinatorial and geometric approaches (e.g. wiring diagrams have not been worked out for braided monoidal categories, AFAIK, only symmetric ones), for the purpose of <em>communicating to a human</em> a composite of morphisms in an SMC, it doesn't matter how you think about the diagram.</p>
<p>OTOH, in your <em>computational</em> setting, you probably want the combinatorial notion. I'd prefer to call that a "wiring diagram," but as the other replies indicate the term "string diagram" is also used as a catchall for diagrams like this.</p>

<p>This is what we have mostly used so far in two related projects, <a href="https://valueflo.ws/">https://valueflo.ws/</a> and <a href="https://github.com/holo-rea">https://github.com/holo-rea</a> </p>
<p>The diagrams show strings or wires or arrows between nodes, which can be individual or group Agents or Processes or Exchanges or any mixture thereof, at any level of abstraction or aggregation that suits the purpose of the diagram. </p>
<p>For example, you could use individual Agents, or group Agents, or types of Agents, or Agents performing some function like farmers. You could use small or large-grained Processes.</p>
<p>The arrows are directed, from one node to another node, and Economic Resources ride on them. You could depict the Resources as labels on the arrows or separate named shapes.</p>
<p>The Resources are usually abstract rather than tangible: Resource Specifications or classifications or taxonomy items at any level of specificity. For example, an arrow could show Fruit, or Apples, or Granny Smith Apples, or Organic Apples from Eve's Orchard (which is a real place).</p>
<p>The Resources on the arrows could be quantified, and if so, you could vary the width of the arrow according to the quantity of the Resources on it, creating something like a Sankey diagram.</p>
<p>The shapes don't matter, only that the reader be able to distinguish nodes from arrows and resources. The style as we use it is very flexible, but it's good to be consistent within a family of diagrams or a family of projects.</p>
<p>The diagram style comes from the Applied Category Theory community, where they use them with mathematical rigor and consider them the logical equivalent of code or proofs. We will not try to use them so rigorously...yet. None of us understands enough Category Theory to do that, and we have not yet attracted any experienced Category Theorists (Catsters) to help us. But becoming more mathematically rigorous with our diagrams would be a good research project for somebody, and would probably enable some new and interesting capabilities. </p>
<p>Two capabilities emerge easily: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If a node has a resource arrow as an input but the arrow has no source, another node could be connected which can provide that resource as an output. Same with node with a resource arrow as an output but no destination, another node could be connected that wants that resource as an input. Likewise with resource arrows with quantities: if the source or destination quantity is less than the resource arrow quantity, other nodes could be connected to take up the slack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our diagrams are already rigorous enough to be able to be generated programmatically from data. Here are a couple of not-very-good proofs of concept that could be improved:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://valueflows.pythonanywhere.com/vocab/egg2worm-flow/">http://valueflows.pythonanywhere.com/vocab/egg2worm-flow/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://locecon.org/clusters/network/11/">http://locecon.org/clusters/network/11/</a><br>
More rigor might allow generating code and data from diagram.</li>
</ul>
<p>The name of the diagram style varies from one Catster publication to another. They mostly say String Diagram, but sometimes Wiring Diagram. Some of them consider those names to be synonomyms, some them assign different meanings to each name. I asked them which name we should use and the rough consensus seemed to be, if we are just using the diagrms to communicate with humans, it doesn't matter. If we become more rigorous and use the diagrams as code, it might matter.</p>
<p>Here is an overview and a bunch of references about string diagrams from a category theory viewpoint: <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/string+diagram">https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/string+diagram</a></p>

<p><span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="276438">Fabrizio Genovese</span> thanks. Given those criteria, would you say that the lemon meringue pie diagram is a string diagram?</p>
<p>(I don't understand lens-like rules or free categories so can't tell. Or you or somebody else could point me to a reference that would explain those concepts.)</p>

<p>I would say that the lemon meringue pie is a string diagram, yes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="275965">Evan Patterson</span> "wiring diagram" has the additional advantage that a lot of people already have a vague notion of what it means whereas "string diagram" is new to most people. </p>
<p>(On the other hand, we are not really doing electrical wiring diagrams for the most part, but we have done electrical system diagrams using the same style so I think it fits.)</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for the conversation. I'll switch to "wiring diagram" and see how it flies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This also depends on who you are talking to. For sure, string diagrams are much older and well studied than wiring diagrams in category theory, the latter being a relatively new thing. So I would guess that the average category theorist is more familiar with string diagrams than with wiring diagrams... <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span></p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276438">@Fabrizio Genovese</span> thank you very much! As you can see from my draft blog post, i backpedaled a bit from switching to wiring diagram.</p>
