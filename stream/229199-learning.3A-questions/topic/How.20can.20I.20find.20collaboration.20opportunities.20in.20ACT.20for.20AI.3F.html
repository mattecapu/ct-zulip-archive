<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I hope this message finds you well! I’m a second-year master’s student in mathematics with experience in data engineering, data science, and artificial intelligence. Recently, I’ve been exploring <strong>Geometric Deep Learning</strong> and have become deeply interested in the nascent field of <strong>Categorical Deep Learning</strong>, which I discovered through the <strong>Category for AI School</strong> videos and the papers by <strong>Bruno Gavranović et al.</strong></p>
<p>I’m now seeking to get involved in a research project that bridges applied category theory with a computational component, involving the development and testing of algorithms derived from category-theoretic methods. (I am a beginner in category theory, so I apologize if my terminology lacks precision.)</p>
<p>An example of the type of project I’m interested in is the 2025 Adjoint School project <strong>“Compositional Generalization in Reinforcement Learning” by Georgios Bakirtzis</strong>. This project addresses compositional generalization in reinforcement learning through a category-theoretic computational framework in Julia, producing both category theory-derived algorithms and experimental results. This blend of theoretical depth and practical experimentation is precisely what excites me, and I would love to explore similar opportunities.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I couldn’t apply to the Adjoint School in time, but I’m keen to find other avenues to engage with similar research. I’d greatly appreciate:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Suggestions</strong> for ongoing or upcoming projects that combine theoretical and computational aspects of applied category theory and AI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Recommendations</strong> for resources, tools, or techniques to help bridge the gap between theory and implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Advice</strong> on how to build collaborations with researchers or groups working on these intersections.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m eager to contribute and collaborate with like-minded individuals or groups. If you have any ideas, opportunities, or guidance, I’d be deeply grateful!</p>
