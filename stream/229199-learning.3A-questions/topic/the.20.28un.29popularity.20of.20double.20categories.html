<p>Double categories are pretty fashionable in category theory nowadays, what with a series of online conferences about them, and people using them to study open systems, and now even as a key part of the software system Catcolab.</p>
<p>But my impression is that 20-50 years ago double categories were quite <em>un</em>popular, even in the category theory community, and even among people interested in 2-categories.   I felt that Grandis and Pare were "voices in the wilderness" preaching the importance of double categories but largely going unheard (with some obvious exceptions).  </p>
<p>Does anyone have thoughts about this - or much better, <em>written evidence</em> of people discussing the (un)popularity of double categories back then?</p>

<p>Good topic. One thing that comes to mind is <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2008/05/double_categories_warm_and_cud.html">this abstract</a> posted on the n-Cat Cafe as late as 2008, which begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ross Street, Double categories for better or worse, Australian Category Seminar, Macquarie University, Wednesday May 28, 2008.</p>
<p>Abstract: I suspect no-one actually thinks of double categories as warm and cuddly, or wants to study them for their own sakes. Usually they are studied as a means to an end... Much interest in double categories has been to use them to study 2-categories. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So here is a statement in plain terms by a famous 2-category theorist that such interest as there is in double categories is mostly as a means to understand 2-categories.</p>

<p>For what it's worth, that was also my impression.  Around 20 years ago I was a graduate student, and it definitely seemed to me that all the interest and momentum was around <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">n</span></span></span></span>-categories.  (But I expect you know that better than I do, having been one of the organizers of the 2004 IMA conference on <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">n</span></span></span></span>-categories that was my introduction to the field.)  I remember being surprised by the realization during my thesis work that the structures I was looking at <em>weren't</em> really bicategories but double categories, and making an intentional effort to popularize double categories and other higher-categorical structures.</p>

<p>As for written evidence, it's hard to find evidence of a negative, but we could point to writings that <em>could</em> have mentioned double categories but didn't.  For instance, Steve Lack's 2007 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0702535">2-categories companion</a> only mentions double categories as "a related notion" that "will be less important".  (Of course the title declares that it will be about 2-categories rather than double categories, but I happen to know that that paper was titled after it was written, so the title didn't influence the choice of topics.)</p>

<p>We could also look at things that could have been done earlier but weren't, or were done in a different way.  For instance, there was a substantial amount of work that went into studying the bicategory Prof and characterizing bicategories like it.  I feel like if double categories had been more fashionable, some of that work would have considered Prof as a double category.</p>

<p>Thanks, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275965">@Evan Patterson</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276777">@Mike Shulman</span> !  That abstract by Street is very good evidence: little did we suspect that Street favored "warm and cuddly" math.   <span aria-label="smirk" class="emoji emoji-1f60f" role="img" title="smirk">:smirk:</span>   The remark by Lack is also good.</p>
<p>I can probably get more evidence by talking to Grandis and Pare.  </p>
<p>What I'm planning to do, btw, is write a short paper about the rise of double category theory, especially in "applied" category theory.   Both of you have played key roles in that rise.</p>

<p>To be precise, what Lack said is that double categories "will be less important <em>in this companion</em>".  I didn't mean to give the impression he was stating they were less important in general (although he may have felt that they were).</p>

<p>My impression is that internal categories are less studied than enriched categories more generally, though I do not know a reference discussing this.</p>

<p>Yes, Mike really helped popularize double categories as well as proving a lot of theorems that show how we can use them effectively to do various things.</p>
