<p>[Beginner Question]:</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> In <em>Category Theory for the Sciences</em>, Spivak defines an aspect as, "the way of viewing a thing, <em>x</em>; a particular way in which <em>x</em> can be regarded or measured." He gives the example that a molecule has a molecular mass so a molecular mass is an aspect of a molecule. Later, he goes on to say that every function has an image. I follow this all and this makes sense to me.</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> What I get confused on is an exercise he poses where he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For each of the following types, write a function for which it is the image, or write “not clearly useful as an image type.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many types he gives but the one I am going to use is <em>a used book</em>. In this case, I took <em>a used book</em> to be an aspect that has the relationship:</p>
<p>a book -- was owned by --&gt; a person </p>
<p>Which I would read as "A book which was owned by a person" which I think describes the aspect of <em>a used book</em> as an image type of books.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Somehow, this doesn't sit right as when I draw out a small olog to describe this process, the paths do not commute leading me think I am wrong in my reasoning somewhere. Could anyone explain to me why <em>a used book</em> is not a valid image type? Thanks! <a href="/user_uploads/21317/PZzCYMTBpWAmz1JiVjj5tvOg/image.png">image.png</a></p>

<p>The "is" arrow should go the other way and the upper function doesn't make sense given that not every book is owned by someone?</p>

<p>Agreed. Ownership of a book should be a bidirectional relationship (<a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/span">[[span]]</a>) <br>
Book &lt;- Ownership -&gt; Person.</p>

<p>This makes sense - thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277473">@Morgan Rogers (he/him)</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="278008">@Spencer Breiner</span> . Out of curiosity, my intuition when the olog didn't make sense - is this a good way of "checking" myself when working through questions such as these? Because, as y'all indicate, I was right in my thinking that I was wrong. Just couldn't pinpoint why with the language I currently knew/understood. Thanks!</p>

<p>I don't understand your question, but it's definitely good to keep in mind that sometimes when you're confused, it's because the book is confused.</p>
