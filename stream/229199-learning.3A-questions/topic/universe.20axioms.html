<p>I know McLarty and others spent a lot of time trying to eliminate the use of universes, but I always thought that was just out of interest in seeing if it could be done, not to allay actual doubts.</p>

<p>Not by experts, perhaps, but you got things like this: <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/35746/inaccessible-cardinals-and-andrew-wiless-proof">https://mathoverflow.net/questions/35746/inaccessible-cardinals-and-andrew-wiless-proof</a>, where the "proof" that universes wasn't needed is that Brian Conrad says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For etale cohomology all of that universe stuff is entirely irrelevant. I say this not as an "article of faith", but because I've read all of the proofs of the theorems of etale cohomology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So do we have to believe this guy who says he read all the references from Wiles' papers back to SGA4 and figured out how to eliminate universes, but never wrote up his argument? This is not just my take, but here's Ekedahl, responding</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I completely agree with BCnrd opinions here but as far as I know there is no published complete proof of the relevant results that bypasses SGA IV so in that sense it is not an established fact.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is mention on that post that Manin once asked publicly about whether universes could be eliminated from the proof of the Weil conjectures by Deligne, so perhaps that's another data point</p>

<p>Not to mention Brian Conrad's heuristic for rejecting universes hinges on being able to work around the impredicativity inherent to category-theoretic universal properties:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The 2nd issue is univ. mapping properties on "entire category" (your comment about "whole categories of sheaves"). That's an issue for category theory in general, not just SGA; handled as for flatness against "all" mods over a ring.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even I as a category theorist agree that this is an issue that needs to be taken more seriously by category theorists and advocates of category theory in general – with or without universes. Not for nothing did I make it the subject of my first paper. So I feel I understand where the sceptics (of category theory!) are coming from.</p>

<p>Am I correct that the axiom of universes is not just independent of ZFC, but that it might even be false?<br>
This is something that does not happen with older approaches to universes, such as NBG set theory. The drawback of NBG set theory is that you only have two universes (a universe of sets and a universe of classes), but it seems that the construction can be iterated to get more universes.

<p>I agree that it can not be false and independent at the same time, but I believe it is not known which of the two it is. Whereas for NBG set theory it is known that it is consistent if and only if ZFC is consistent.</p>

<p>Universes can be used to prove the consistency of ZFC, so this is a clearly a different situation from NBG. But I think saying we don't know if universes are inconsistent or not, while true, is overstating the case since we don't know that ZFC or PA are consistent either. I don't think anyone seriously thinks adding universes makes things inconsistent here.</p>

<p>It does seem to me that the objection is not probably not something like "I believe ZFC is consistent but large cardinals are not" but rather "I never needed universes in my work before, why do you?" – that is, it's an objection of parsimony. And maybe some maximalists also object on the grounds that the category of "all sets" should be literally that and not secretly replaced with "all sets in U".</p>

<p>Yes, ideally there would be some theorem that says that any classical statement without universes (i.e. about "small things") is provable in ZFC+universes if and only if it is provably in ZFC. This would be very practical, for example it would eliminate the discussion about whether or not universes are needed to prove FLT (without having to look at the proof of FLT).</p>
<p>However, as long as we don't even know that ZFC+universes is equiconsistent with ZFC, we can't hope for a theorem like this.</p>

<p>That would be nice, but unfortunately, ZFC+U proves Con(ZFC) while ZFC doesn't (assuming it's consistent), and Con(ZFC) is a statement purely about natural numbers, which are pretty "small".</p>

<p>Ah yes, this shows that the theorem can't exist. But the theorem does exist if you use NBG set theory rather than universes. So I'm a bit confused as to why universes are used more often. Maybe there is some advantage of universes over NBG set theory that I'm missing.</p>

<p>I almost said something similar, but is this right? I thought equiconsistent just meant the one is consistent iff the other one is. If they are both consistent then this would be true. Of course, we couldn't prove it.</p>

<p>I think part of the point is that the axiom of universes is so easy and natural to use if you're already using ZFC, while using NBG requires actually learning new stuff.    I typically work with ZFC in the back of my mind, and if I accidentally say something like "the category of all categories" I whip out the axiom of universes to save my butt.</p>

<p>I'm convinced that we need more than two universes, just maybe not as many as provided by the axiom of universes. Maybe countably many would be enough? Then the category of sets is a class, the category of classes is a 2-class, the category of 2-classes is a 3-class, and so on.</p>

<p>Btw Lawvere seems to take a different position on the matter --- I think that Lawvere believes that the failure of cartesian closure for classes is more of a failure of imagination, and we should just assert that classes do whatever we want them to do. I guess Lawvere's view is not so different from the universe perspective.</p>
<p>The difficulty for me is that I am torn between the fibrational perspective, where I use relative category theory to deal with the relationship between "large" and "small", and the fact that it remains difficult even to develop fibered category theory without a pre-existing notion of large and small. I think these things could be dealt with in principle, but I do not yet have the skills.</p>

<p>I feel similarly. Often introducing universes 'solves' the size issues, but leads to constructions which are sensitive to exactly what level of the hierarchy they are done at. And if you want the constructions to be invariant with respect to this level in a nice way or whatever, you then end up needing to solve the same things you would have needed to if you just dealt with the size issues in the first place.</p>

<p>This is something I've thought about a fair amount.  One way to deal with the sensitivity to level is to use something like <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/11/feferman_set_theory.html">Feferman set theory</a> or a reflection principle, where the "smallness" cutoff doesn't have any special properties.</p>

<p>Just to clarify for Jens, the collection of all classes (as conventionally understood in the ontology of NBG or MK) is not a "universe" in the same way that the collection of all sets is. If we write V for the collection of all sets then, roughly speaking, the collection of all classes is P(V), and though V is an element of P(V), P(V) is not, and we want universes to be closed under P.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276777">@Mike Shulman</span> This discussion also reminds me of a suggestion of Hamkins --- which is that rather than having simply a hierarchy of grothendieck universes, you want their inclusions to be elementary embeddings.

Have you thought about such an arrangement and whether it helps with the problems we are discussing?</p>

<p>It's definitely true that not every logical functor is an elementary embedding.  One reason is that general logical functor only <em>preserves</em> the truth of statements, while an elementary embedding preserves and reflects them.  A <em>conservative</em> logical functor also reflects truth, so it is closer to an EE.  The second reason I can think of is that logical functors deal only with bounded statements, while EEs deal with arbitrary ones.  That makes me think that an elementary embedding is strictly stronger than a conservative logical functor.  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="416301">@Zhen Lin Low</span> , can you think of an example of the last sort you suggested, an elementary substructure that is not a logical functor?</p>
