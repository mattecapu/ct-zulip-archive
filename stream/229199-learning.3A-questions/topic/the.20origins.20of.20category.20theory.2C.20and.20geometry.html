<p><a href="/user_uploads/21317/6d2QbjwaI5uSGelV0VAu6V5I/image.png">image.png</a> <br>
I'm seeing this 'origin of category theory' slides in Chinese, which mentioned Poincaré on combinatorial topology, Noether &amp; Hopf on homology group, Poincaré &amp; Hopf on fundamental group &amp; homology, Carten Eilenberg on homotopy group &amp; modules &amp; derived functor, Eilenber &amp; Mac Lane on group homology. Is there a way I can understand these concepts and history better? Why is topology is important in geometry? Do people want to take limit on something? Where does that limit come from? Do they all have implications in physical sciences e.g. general relativity, thermodynamics, or are they just pure math? When people say 'algebraic geometry', what kind of geometry are they referring to and how similar or dissimilar it is to Riemanian geometry? Is there any code I can write to understand these better? What are the concrete mathematical objects that one can think of when going through the abstract concepts?</p>

<p>That's a lot of questions! I'll try to answer the one I understand, remember asking people is not subsitute for personal study and research.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why is topology is important in geometry?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Topology is the geometry which studies properties of spaces invariant under continuous transformations. Contrast this with 'linear algebra' (which is actually geometry) which studies thing invariant under linear transformations, 'affine geometry' which does the same thing with affine transformations, and so on. So topology is important in geometry insofar as it is a kind of geometry. There's also a lot of cross-pollination between various kinds of geometries, so topological ideas went to influence algebraic geometry and algebraic ideas went on to influence topology.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>All of math has implications in the understanding of everything else <img alt=":yo-dark:" class="emoji" src="https://zulip-avatars.s3.amazonaws.com/21317/emoji/images/21514.png" title="yo-dark">, including mathematical phyiscs.

<p>I'd say any really good mathematical physicist should know most of this stuff.  They're basically not used at all in thermodynamics (though I can imagine doing it), and they're used only a little in general relativity, but they're used a fair amount in quantum field theory - some more than others.  </p>
<p>I imagine any serious quantum field theorist understands the basics of homology groups, fundamental groups and higher homotopy groups.</p>

<p>I think you need to learn all this stuff if you're really serious about understanding <em>space</em> and <em>symmetry</em>.   But it takes about 5 years, so you have to think a bit about what your goals are.</p>

<p>Actually you'd meet all this stuff <em>except</em> group homology in a typical high-powered year-long course on algebraic topology.  For example, most of it is in Hatcher's <a href="https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/AT/AT.pdf">free book on algebraic topology</a>.</p>

<p>However, he does the bare minimum on derived functors, and I don't think he covers group cohomology at all.   For both of those I'd recommend Rotman's <em>Introduction to Homological Algebra</em> - the old edition, which is much shorter than the new edition.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>That's sometimes called 'point-set topology' and it's surprisingly different from other flavors of topology, the more structural ones (I recently read a remark along these lines... but I don't remember). General topology is more interested in properties that might fail for spaces considered by 'elementary analysis', like separability or connectedness or compactness. The most spectacular applications of topology arise from algebraic topology though, where one studies algebraic invariants attached to topological spaces. Be careful though, since most invariants actually  depends only on the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/homotopy%20type">[[homotopy type]]</a> of a space, so on something even weaker than topology!</p>

<p>Is is said in that video that algebraic geometry 'analyzes geometry with algebra', is it like solving algebraic equations one can calculate intersection of geometric objects, or other properties of these equations give corresponds to geometric properties in analytic geometry? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exactly!! That's the very beginning of algebraic geometry. Modern developments are just pushing this idea much further.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How far did people end up going beyond 'group symmetry'? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, there's a huge amount to understand about group symmetry: the theory of Lie groups and their representations, infinite-dimensional analogues of Lie groups, principal bundles and the connections on them, etc. - any good quantum field theorist is expected to know this stuff, and you need algebraic topology to work with these things.   </p>
<p>Second, physicists have been exploring generalizations of groups including <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/quantum%20groups">[[quantum groups]]</a>, <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/2-groups">[[2-groups]]</a> (which are categorified groups), <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/3-groups">[[3-groups]]</a> and higher groups.   Quantum groups are important in condensed matter physics and 3d TQFT.  People are starting to explore <a href="https://arxiv.org/search/?query=%222-group%22+AND+condensed&amp;searchtype=all&amp;abstracts=show&amp;order=-announced_date_first&amp;size=50">2-groups in condensed matter physics</a>.</p>

<p>I mention condensed matter physics because this tends to have more contact with experiment than theoretical particle physics.</p>

<p>I meant physical space or spacetime, studied using mathematics.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is the easiest example of a functor between an algebraic group or ring and a topological space?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That doesn't make sense: a functor could go from a <em>category</em> of groups to a <em>category</em> of topological spaces, not from an individual group to an individual topological space.</p>
<p>(Experts may object but I claim those objections are too sophisticated: I'm trying to coach him in how to speak like a mathematician.)</p>
