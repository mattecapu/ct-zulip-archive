<p>I published the blog post I mentioned in this other channel <a href="#narrow/stream/229199-learning.3A-questions/topic/Rigorous.20string.20diagrams/near/207180495">https://categorytheory.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/229199-learning.3A-questions/topic/Rigorous.20string.20diagrams/near/207180495</a> <br>
but moved this comment over here because in the blog post, I claimed that ACT is in fact a cooperative economic network, so I thought I'd ask what people thought about that.</p>
<p>I don't see much evidence of rivalry and competition, altho I am sure it exists. I see in your statements of values and conduct and general practices not so much an adversarial game (altho I do understand why y'all like them theoretically) but a lot of cooperation.</p>
<p>And the economic elements arrive in the positions topic and the constant discussions of PHD programs and also the applications in economics, industry, and government.</p>
<p>Here's that blog post: <a href="https://write.as/economic-networks/visual-languages-resource-flow-diagrams">https://write.as/economic-networks/visual-languages-resource-flow-diagrams</a></p>
<p>It's still editable by me, so if anybody wants anything changed, I'm on it...</p>
