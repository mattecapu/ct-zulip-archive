<p>It just hit me while I was working on the stat mech of the Carnot engine that force is the derivative of momentum in a different way than I normally think about it. I.e., I normally think about it in terms of force producing a change in momentum for a specific object. But another way of thinking about it is that it measures the flow of momentum. This became clear to me when I derived the pressure of an ideal gas by calculating the momentum flow into its boundary from collisions by particles.</p>
<p>Two gases that are at equilibrium because they have matched pressures have a balanced equilibrium of momentum flowing in to each other.</p>
<p>I feel like there is an essentially "open" quality to analysis of flow like this that is absent from the "closed" perspective of Hamiltonian mechanics, and I would like to understand how to bring this kind of thing into the more general setting of Hamiltonian mechanics.</p>

<p>Similarly, two gases that are in equilibrium of temperature have a balanced equilibrium of kinetic energy flowing in to each other.</p>

<p>This implies that temperature is the rate at which heat energy flows out of the boundary</p>

<p>You might like my work on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11392">open Hamitonian systems</a>.  But so far it's just getting started - there's a lot of stuff I know should be done, that we didn't get around to!  For example we worked out the open Euler-Lagrange equations but didn't write about them, and there should also be an open version of Hamilton's equations.</p>
