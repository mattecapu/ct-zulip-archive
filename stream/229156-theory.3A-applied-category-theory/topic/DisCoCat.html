<p>I think of it like the free autonomous cat is a proof-relevant version of the free pregroup. So the linear map you apply to your word vector depends on the derivation, not just on the fact that a derivation exists</p>

<p>So the original idea of discocat is "we tag every word with an element of the pregroup (noun, sentence, whatevs) and then we use the pregroup rules to infer the wiring. The reason why you can't do this is because you can prove that the vector space you get is trivial (as Preller did). So we resort to generate this huge category with all the words in it. Then things clearly work, but I guess you lose the original purpose of the idea, that is, separating tags from semantics, and encoding the tagging system in the functor. Now tags, semantics and tagging systems are all more or less conflated in the free CCC you generate.</p>

<p>Practically speaking, that's how I'd imagine languages behave. The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12412v1" title="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12412v1">ERNIE work</a> I cited over in #general showed how their system improved when they allowed some form of "chunking", which seems to me to mess up the neat tagging system envisioned in the original idea (at least to the best of my understanding of your description). Their original motivation was to improve the processing of Chinese, where you often smoosh characters together to make a word that has a meaning not obvious from the surface meanings of its characters. Similar things happen in English as well: proper nouns, idioms, sayings, etc.</p>

<p>Yes. This has to do with the fact that, as you said, current method basically work well only for romance languages, maybe indo-european. I'm a language geek myself and I had my share of non-european languages, and I agree that current approaches in DiscoCat scale quite badly outside of Romance/Germanic languages.</p>

<p>So while in English, say, I always have to communicate <em>when</em> an action is happening (dobe my picking a tense), this is not true in Egyptian, or in Japanese to some extent. Japanese is particularly interesting, because if on one hand they care very little about being specific in our western grammatical sense, on the other they are very careful wrt other things we are totally oblivious of, such as who you are speaking to (the same sentence can be said in many different ways depending on the degree of politeness you want to use, and for westeners it's insane how much granular this can be)</p>

Understanding what this structure is is part of the effort, in the same way as better understanding what the meaning spaces are, and these two problems are obviously not two separate ones, but a single one.</p>

<p>I can answer only WRT what we were doing when I was doing it. So for instance you have the sentence "Clowns Tell Jokes". Now "Clowns" and "Jokes" are states, that is, vectors that live in vector spaces that you can build more or less easily by doing thesaurus extraction of whatnot. "Tell" is a verb, so it expects a noun on the left, a noun on the right (which you compose using caps) and spits out a state (hence a vector) in some other vector space,  which is the space where sentences live. Clearly one of the main problems there is that no one had a clue about how this space looked like, or how to build it. Another approach we pursued was a cognitive-oriented one, which is the one I used in my PhD thesis. That was conceptually satisfying, but without learning techniques it was basically impossible to build real-life spaces and do something more than toy models</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276692">@Bob Coecke</span> claims to have solved this problem in the last paper. The idea of describing verbs as "applying things to nouns" is nice because gets rid of this sentence space altogether and allows you to live only in the spaces you already have but I don't know if it works for any verb. About the functor, the first DisCoCat paper was great because there wasn't any functor, and relationships between grammar/semantics were done using products. So yes, it was a unique category but things were still neatly separated, somehow. I still think that a functor Semantics -&gt; Grammar is useful, not from the NLP point of view, but from a linguistic perspective. It is also a nice point to tackle a lot of problems in Applied Category Theory that pop up pretty much everywhere, but are more pronounced for language, such as the fact that categories are more or less bad to deal with exceptions.</p>

<p>Anyway, now that I get a rough idea of what these spaces are, here's what I think is missing: recursion. I haven't seen any provision for recursion in this framework, and per Chomsky, this is a key feature of human language. My guess is that you need to provide for recursion in order to handle any expressions less trivial than simple grade 1 sentences, which means exploring more intricate categorical structures. The properads thread may be one place to look. I see polycategories gathering a lot of interest here, and at first glance, these look useful. Monads (and maybe 2-monads) too, perhaps.</p>

<p>I think that might have been true when the problem was coming up with something that could solve a low-level pattern recognition problem in NLP, but now that that's (mostly) done, we need to find better tools to cope with the higher-level NLP problems, and DisCoCat turned out to be a step in the right direction.</p>

<p>I think DisCoCirc looks interesting, and if you have circuits, operads and friends are probably something to look at. I think semantics and grammar interact both ways, but functors are perhaps too simple to model that interaction. I think we've been ignoring the very important <em>context</em> plays in semantics, both in terms of syntactic context and "embodied" or "environmental" context. For good reasons, I hasten to add: the latter is definitely still a big and messy problem to deal with, even as the former seems to be getting more tractable.</p>

<p>I think that was the prevailing attitude in practical NLP at the time DisCoCat came out, because Frederick Jelinek <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110728025129/http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org/technical-committees/list/sl-tc/spl-nl/2010-11/jelinek/" title="https://web.archive.org/web/20110728025129/http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org/technical-committees/list/sl-tc/spl-nl/2010-11/jelinek/">pioneered the application of information theory to speech recognition</a> with great success. I think it's only now, with speech recognition being somewhat serviceable but making high-level mistakes, that linguistic knowledge would come to the forefront.</p>

<p>Definitely agree on no clear break between human and animal, but also don't think of language as a tool; what is is the embodiment of it, but the fundamental ontology for me is a representation of reality, and grammar represents the interaction structures of that reality.</p>

<p>When I say "language as a tool" what I really focus on is this: There are many different languages. some are highly inflected, some aren't inflected at all. Some can be even whistled, others have a very scarce phonetic inventory etc. I don't think these differences arise by chance. Instead, I think they arise because a language with some features is more efficient than another with different features in a given context.</p>

<p>So the original idea of discocat is "we tag every word with an element of the pregroup (noun, sentence, whatevs) and then we use the pregroup rules to infer the wiring. The reason why you can't do this is because you can prove that the vector space you get is trivial (as Preller did). So we resort to generate this huge category with all the words in it. Then things clearly work, but I guess you lose the original purpose of the idea, that is, separating tags from semantics, and encoding the tagging system in the functor. Now tags, semantics and tagging systems are all more or less conflated in the free CCC you generate.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if I understand this characterization of the free compact closed category. My understanding is that the words are still freely generated by grammatical types, the key difference between this category and a pregroup, is that the free compact closed category is not a preorder (meaning that there can be more than one morphism between pairs of objects). To use <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276692">@Bob Coecke</span>'s favorite phrase, this is a feature not a bug because  it allows you to keep better track of the way in which the meanings of sentences are computed.</p>
