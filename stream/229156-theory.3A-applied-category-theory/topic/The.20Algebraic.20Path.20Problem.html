<p>I wrote <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.06682">a paper</a> about computing the algebraic path problem on systems which are left open to their surroundings. I'm eager to get feedback on this...I'm new to computer science so I'm hoping that people here will have a perspective on this that I don't. </p>
<p><strong>A bit about the paper</strong>: The algebraic path problem is a  generalization of the shortest path problem which covers a lot of ground. For any commutative quantale <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">R</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault" style="margin-right:0.00773em;">R</span></span></span></span> (i.e. monoidal closed poset with all joins), the algebraic path problem computes the transitive closure of matrices weighted in <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">R</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault" style="margin-right:0.00773em;">R</span></span></span></span>. Here is a table showing some of the problems you can solve by choosing different quantales: </p>
<p><a href="/user_uploads/21317/8HtDp6fPTaOLQOc8z9jKRHoH/table.jpeg">table.jpeg</a></p>

More specifically, there is a bicategory where morphisms are open <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">R</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault" style="margin-right:0.00773em;">R</span></span></span></span>-matrices and composition is gluing of these open <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">R</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault" style="margin-right:0.00773em;">R</span></span></span></span>-matrices. The transitive closure, and therefore the solution to the algebraic path problem on open <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">R</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault" style="margin-right:0.00773em;">R</span></span></span></span>-matrices, can be cast as a functor from this bicategory. I was very pleased to get the mapping to be functorial with respect to this gluing.  In particular, functoriality gives an ismorphism between the solution of the algebraic path problem on a composite system to the solutions on its components. I hope that this isomorphism can inspire better algorithms for computing the algebraic path problem.</p>
<p>I also have a softer question. I find the conference/publishing culture of computer science to be very confusing. I'm wondering if anyone has a suggestion on a good place to submit a paper like this if my goal is to get a job in academic computer science.</p>

<p>Jade -- very nice! have you seen <a href="http://stedolan.net/research/semirings.pdf">http://stedolan.net/research/semirings.pdf</a> -- how close is a commutative quantale to a "closed semiring"?</p>
<p>On to the soft question. Here is my worth a grain of salt take. Other people might say "actually papers just like this are published in CS venue X" and they're probably right and I didn't know about X. But as is, it feels like its not yet pitched at a CS audience sufficiently. I note that one basic thing to do would be to take your formula in (3) and actually write out in pseudocode in your language of choice (or real code in haskell or something) how to actually perform this procedure. Otherwise people will say "you've shown me a mathematical result, but I don't actually see a procedure anywhere!"</p>
<p>Writing up things for CS is weird, in my observation, because I think most things have to be explained very explicitly, like to an undergraduate, but there are occasional things that if you explain them too explicitly people will feel "talked down" to, and it is perhaps hard to know which is which, until you see what reviewers yell at you about.</p>
<p>One key element is  you need to choose if you want your paper to be "Theory A" or "Theory B": <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2003/03/theory-and-theory-b.html">https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2003/03/theory-and-theory-b.html</a></p>
<p>One way I think of this is "Theory B" is more about "how can we describe/classify/translate problems we want to solve" (and sometimes "is this solvable at all") and "Theory A" is more about "ok, given a specification of a problem, how efficiently can we solve it". </p>
<p>The two cultures only have modest overlap, and people with CS-ties on a place like this (including myself) will tend towards Theory B. But most (not all!) CS academic jobs  in the U.S. have tended towards Theory A in the past. Nowadays, I think there is also just "systems engineering" stuff which I can't really classify. My description here is a bit rude and ignorant, but it seems to me: "here's a real world problem, here's a smaller version, and we just like wrote a program and ran it a bit and it did some stuff, take a look." Sometimes it's "here's the actual real world problem, and working with  BIGCO we actually did write some stuff to solve it, in some sense, maybe, and we can't show you the stuff, because it's proprietary, but we're going to make some claims about it anyway."</p>
<p>Anyway, your result points the way towards something that Theory A might appreciate, but it's not there yet. To make it acceptable at a Theory A venue I'd think you'd want some actual claim where you say "if the input stuff has this structure than we can give these improved complexity bounds" that's very crisp, and that would be the "point". For the more systemsy "Theory A" stuff you instead find some real-world dataset and run your algorithm and some competing ones over it, and show "we don't know exactly why the data has this structure, but in practice we did better." For "Theory B" you could instead say "let's take compositionality as fundamental, and now we prove this procedure works on tiny things, and that when you take pushouts of tiny things it carries through", so now we derive a "correct-by-construction" procedure for big things. Then, ideally, you code-it-up in Agda or something and the proof of the required property of the result is constructed inductively with the result itself, and that's considered of interest.</p>
<p>Other people will I'm sure have other and better ideas as to how one would streamline it into one of those slots.</p>

<p>Thanks Gershom. I hadn't seen that pdf but it looks great. A (commutative?) quantale can be turned into a closed semiring with join as it's +. The * operation is given by the free monoid in the preorder of your quantale.</p>

<p>Also what your saying about Theory A and Theory B is very helpful. It wasn't a distinction I was really familiar with and it's definitely something I  should know about.  Your suggestion and sketch for a more Theory A version of this paper sounds good...I definitely want to see how applied I can go.</p>

<p>I don't think you can become a Theory A person very quick, Jade.   I know about this distinction, and everything we do is heavily Theory B (or maybe Theory C if such a thing exists).</p>

<p>I and perhaps many other people find "genuine" Theory A a bit scary and imposing. But it isn't all like NP complexity stuff. Some of it really is closer to e.g. Tarjan's papers on graph algorithms. It's just the style and formalisms used are a different sort of rigorous.</p>

<p>One origin of Jade's paper was that I was trying to come up with a really practical application of the "network models" that <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275914">@Joe Moeller</span> and I had been coming up with.   I was trying to use them to help solve shortest-path problems.</p>

<p>You're right that it would be hard to become a Theory A person very quickly. I was more thinking that it would be good to be a Theory B person with more of a slant towards Theory A. I think this would be a good strategy because Theory A is where the funding is apparently.</p>

<p>I've said 'em over and over. </p>
<p>1) One is the idea of not trying to get the <em>shortest</em> path, just a "reasonably good" path.  That'll let you use approximations to your monad instead of the full-fledged monad.</p>

<p>2) Another is to imagine data that keeps being updated over time.  So, you have a big graph written as a composite of smaller open graphs, and the edges are weighted by elements of some commutative quantale... and let's say you already have an approximate solution to the algebraic path problem for the whole big graph... but then someone updates the edge weights on one of the smaller open graphs!</p>

<p>3) Another is to imagine "black-boxing" one of the smaller open graphs, so all we record about it is the shortest path from each point on its "boundary" to each other point on its "boundary".    This may let us keep track of a lot less information, if all we care about is how to get <em>through</em> this region, not move around <em>inside</em> it.</p>

<p>Well you have a functor, right, that sends an R-matrix to an idempotent R matrix that is in some sense (co?)universal with regards to the one you started with and the "algebraic path problem" is the computation of this in any specific case, right? So you want to write a function in agda, x : RMat -&gt; (y : IRMat, proof of co-universality of y w/r/t x ). Now how do you do that? One way is you write a function that works only for very small things, which you can do exhaustively by cases. Then, for a bigger thing, you decompose it into the small things, run it on the small things, and compose the resultant matrixes and proofs back up. This is often how formalized/mechanized proofs of correctness of inductive algorithms work. Your result seems to suggest that this can be done for the shortest paths problem.</p>
<p>so your new algorithm is maybe not better with regards to complexity, but it does come with a certified proof, and that can be useful, and constructions like that are often able to be written up and presented, because they advance our understanding of how to do "old things" in a "nice, new, proof carrying way". Just like sometimes if you write something "old" up with categorical methods it is of interest to some people for that reason alone, because it is more generalized and useful, so too with something like this.</p>
<p>Hope that makes sense?</p>

<p>So, we need to think about how, after you update a little "patch", you're going to make these updates propagate across the whole graph, in a very nice efficient way.</p>

<p>I guess we should think about the equation on Wikipedia after "and the recursive case is".   This is "the heart of the Floyd-Warshall algorithm", but it's also something about how you compute the free idempotent matrix on a matrix.</p>

<p>characterizing the set of problems where this approach works would be interesting from a theoretical perspective and the people in the graph blas community would welcome it, particularly John Gilbert at UCSB, but they are in general about getting algorithms to go faster on bigger systems.</p>
