<p>As much as I love the category, I'm noticing how bizarrely frustrating it is to write a mode-dependent dynamical systems (a reservoir computer in my case) using Poly constructs. When it comes to generating actual numbers for something nontrivial, debugging becomes a nightmare. It takes several minutes to do the plumbing necessary just to get the outer system to output information I can actually analyze.</p>
<p>Something obvious only happened to occurr to me this week: there's nothing Poly can do that Set can't, really. A dynamical system is just a morphism? Great, it actually is just a morphism in Set also (albeit one that is a giant composition of functions). If you care about type safety, just write Haskell code and use Debug.trace when developing something.</p>
<p>I'm asking this with love of course. I've been excited about the category and have loved working with it, but debugging it versus debugging a little matlab benchmark has caused some existential angst. "Why is anyone even doing this? is it just a cute coincidence that if you take a subcategory of the yoneda embedding you preserve the ability to express dynamical systems? is this actually practical?" etc.</p>

<p>i should note that I have been a programmer for 11 years and have only gotten into category theory about a year ago (and in a very leisurely way. watching bartosz lectures and "reading" topos blog posts without understanding anything). i'm sure i don't have the instincts that someone like Spivak has but i feel like by now I <em>should</em> have "seen the light" and somehow grasped how obviously better Poly is for expressing certain things (i.e. it actually is more natural/practical).</p>

<p>I'd guess that quite a lot of your trouble is coming from the general phenomenon of compositional modelling being very hard at first. It's kinda like learning OOP all over again, except you have to invent all your own design patterns because nothing is standardised yet</p>

<p>For comparison: I'm not using Poly, but I'm using categories of optics which are closely related and share many of the same features. We use Haskell with a hand-rolled implementation of optics, with the core stuff using optics but not hesitating to fall back to plain Haskell whenever it's more convenient for something</p>

<p>The fact that all the data in Poly is "really" just data in Set is a general fact, if you push this to the extreme it becomes the straw-man argument "why are you using language X, assembly/Fortran/C/etc is Turing complete so you can just work there".

<p>I do want to say that yes, i understand this, i didn't make my point very well very well. I guess i was attempting to contrast <em>the difficulty</em> i'm facing in actually writing code using Poly with <em>how naturally it "claims" to be able to represent the things im trying to represent</em>. I tend to roughly interpret "this framework is good for expressing X" as "this framework has a very nice type system", which is why i mentioned type safety in haskell.</p>

<p>I'll point out this wouldn't be the case if one were working in a programming language which 'compiles' to Poly. Instead, atm one has to manually be the compiler and that impacts the practical appeal of Poly constructions. But this is not specific to Poly, but to every category whose internal language is simple and expressive but different from standard type theory.</p>

<p>What you are really saying here is that the bare minimum to make category theory useful in software applications is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implementing the categorical machinery in some language (usually a functional one for peace of mind, but this is not strictly needed)</li>
<li>Implementing a decent DSL to make the most of the given functionality.</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, any programmer will concur on the fact that the 'language' (or more appropriately 'the core machinery' in this case) is just the tip of the iceberg. There's a lot of stuff around it to make the language practically useful, the bare minimum probably being a linter, a packet manager, syntax highlighting, virtual envs etc.</p>
<p>So 'we can do dynamical systems with Poly' won't be really 'we can do dynamical systems with Poly' until all these further pieces of the ecosystem are implemented. And that takes time.</p>

<p>If you want a real-world example of how this looks in practice, take a look at Rust. Rust has probably the most well-developed infrastructure around at the moment, and represents a good standard of 'how these things should look like in the best possible scenario'. If you come from Haskell, which is already a language with a quite developed ecosystem, programming in Rust will basically feel like magic.</p>

<p>Well, if you have a DSL embedded in a language with a nice ecosystem, you can clearly leverage on that, but it is not always going to cut it. For instance, syntax highlighting will be missing for your DSL, as will be advanced debugging features.</p>

<p>And yes, libraries can be fine but they sill have to be packaged in a way so that they can leverage the host language packet manager. Ideally, if Poly allows to represent dynamical systems, I'd like to have libraries of 'already battle-tested' dynamical systems that I can install by just using the host language packet manager from the command line. The alternative would be manually downloading them from this or that repo, which obviously also works, but the point of my comment was exactly that 'also works' may not necessarily mean 'having a nice development experience'.</p>

<p>I followed a few of the poly courses,  and I was wondering if that maps well to actor systems? It seems to from afar, because poly allows nodes to have state, contain other nodes and change behavior. And nodes can be named I think and so composed.<br>
Actor systems such as Erlang or <a href="https://akka.io/">akka</a> are similar to object oriented programming but can work in parallel. Instead of method calls one sends messages from one actor to another. In Akka each actor can change their behavior and spawn children, which can be thought of as contained in the parent actor. In akka actors are named with URLs allowing one to connect actors that were not previously connected.<br>
I have a thread on actors here <a href="https://twitter.com/bblfish/status/1358103100104572930">https://twitter.com/bblfish/status/1358103100104572930</a></p>

<p>I'll point out this wouldn't be the case if one were working in a programming language which 'compiles' to Poly. Instead, atm one has to manually be the compiler and that impacts the practical appeal of Poly constructions. But this is not specific to Poly, but to every category whose internal language is simple and expressive but different from standard type theory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is Poly really that different than standard type theory?  Via things like "Martin lof categories" <a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82087952.pdf">https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82087952.pdf</a> using Poly to me seems a lot like just writing down inductive/coinductive types in e.g. Coq/NuPRL/etc.  In fact Josh Meyers is trying to prove things about Poly in Coq as we speak.  I'm guessing NuPRL will be a lot easier tho</p>

<p>You can definitely interpret MLTT in Poly, but most of the interesting stuff in Poly makes use of the other, 'non-classical' structures (like <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>⊗</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\otimes</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6667em;vertical-align:-0.0833em;"></span><span class="mord">⊗</span></span></span></span> and <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>∘</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\circ</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4445em;"></span><span class="mord">∘</span></span></span></span>).

<p>There is a nice "notation" mechanism in Coq to extend syntax, for example, you can use it to add monad comprehensions to Coq, which are SQL-like syntax. So now  I'm thinking adding Coq notations for those non-classical operations may be part of the contribution of the Coq development, thanks!</p>

<p>I agree with people saying that it's difficult to program using Poly at the moment. That's like how it's difficult to actually program with the lambda calculus. Someone has to do the hard work of creating a Haskell-analogue. But I think there's huge potential there, especially for dynamical systems, but also for data migration and dependent type theory, all in one place.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275901">@Jules Hedges</span> Now I can post what I was working on, because it FINALLY WORKS.<br>
I was trying to model a <a href="https://martinuzzifrancesco.github.io/posts/a-brief-introduction-to-reservoir-computing/">reservoir computer</a>, which is a recurrent neural network that learns how to predict nonlinear time series. It has two basic components: a reservoir of dynamics and a readout layer. The reservoir of dynamics is any large "box" containing a dynamical system with nonlinear dynamics (one doesn't have to understand it), so it's usually implemented via a recurrent neural network where all nodes are connected to all others (there's alternatives but I wont discuss the reservoir literature). The readout layer is like in a regular neural network: it reads from the nodes in the reservoir and multiplies some weights. The big advantage is that you don't train anything but the output layer, so no backprop shenanigans, you can just use linear regression.</p>
<p>The basic idea is, the output layer learns to represent the time series in terms of the dynamics of the reservoir, which is huge compared to the input so it ought to be enough to represent the time series. AFAIK reservoirs are also used for general computation, its part of a broader field of neuromorphic computation.</p>
<p>There's 3 stages: when youre feeding the data, then you hit the reservoir with part of your timeseries to predict to get rid of transient dynamics, then you make the readout layer loop back on the reservoir, and this last stage is when you count its output as a prediction. So in terms of poly, this to me suggested a mode-dependent dynamical system like in the first image linked.<br>
<a href="/user_uploads/21317/tfTIUNxpVnszw7HgxJCs0kwP/PXL_20230516_144114703.jpg">PXL_20230516_144114703.jpg</a><br>
and this is what I was trying to make work, but its problematic for several reasons. one is that the reservoir of dynamics should not have mode-dependence at all, because it just takes an input, multiplies with its weights, and produces an output, it never cares where stuff comes from. Second, the readout layer shouldn't care about "touching" and "going" states, it only accumulates enough data to train.</p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/21317/tfTIUNxpVnszw7HgxJCs0kwP/PXL_20230516_144114703.jpg" title="PXL_20230516_144114703.jpg"><img src="/user_uploads/21317/tfTIUNxpVnszw7HgxJCs0kwP/PXL_20230516_144114703.jpg"></a></div><p>To cut to the chase, I tried to solve this by splitting up the "res" box in the image in two: the reservoir and the readout (second image <br>
<a href="/user_uploads/21317/D_NTTHwoOZudNePRdBSf2_nq/PXL_20230516_144129056.jpg">PXL_20230516_144129056.jpg</a>) . but now I needed some outside "controller" to distinguish between the "touching" and "going" states, and what I discovered is that this is a mess in this setup: delays between the propagation of states started creating inconsistencies, and impossible combinations of states needed to be handled (the controller outputting "Touch" while the readout was still "training" - I didn't find a way to make such a thing unrepresentable, because all the wiring pattern lens has access to is the output of the systems).  I tried some hacks with making the controller output "transition" states for a single timestep, but it became even more of a spaghetti mess. So I just went back to keeping the entire state (and associated counters) within the "res" box and having the "global" state centralized.</p>

<p>on the other hand, poly (really just lenses, no mode dependence needed) makes it really nice to do something like altering parameters of a system "slowly" (i.e. at a timescale much larger than the system's dynamics), by just encoding the changing parameter as an input and having another box provide it. i did it for a little hodgkin huxley simulation and it's <span aria-label="ok" class="emoji emoji-1f44c" role="img" title="ok">:ok:</span> <br>
as far as i can tell this is done in informal/hacky ways in normal dynamical systems modeling.</p>
