<p>I don't think that's true. Almost every bad PhD experience that I've been told about has resulted from a failure of mentorship on the part of the PhD supervisor(s). In the narrowing heights of academia, it's not surprising that without proper guidance and support along the path people tend to struggle.</p>

<p>I think the essentials for a nice phd experience are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nice supervisors. By nice I mean "friendly" and "supportive", not just good at what they do.</li>
<li>Nice environment. By nice I mean "collaborative". In my research group I could discuss about ideas with everyone without fearing that someone would steal them. Actually my very first paper happened while chatting with Stefano Gogioso in the department kitchen. And he said "this idea is nice! Let's write a paper about this!" and I was like "A what? Where do I begin from?". So this kind of environment is really useful.</li>
<li>Conferences to publish into. This ties in with the discussion in <a class="stream-topic" data-stream-id="229156" href="/#narrow/stream/229156-practice.3A-applied-ct/topic/Really.20applied.20ACT">#practice: applied ct &gt; Really applied ACT</a> . If the conferences in your field are too high bar you'll feel useless. Conferences like QPL helped me a lot in feeling "rewarded" for my research.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these things help you to not feel too much pressured in your PhD life. I had all the time to party and to get involved in my college activities, for instance. This involved getting into office tremendously hungover sometimes but overall was very beneficial for my psychological wellbeing.</p>

<p>As "collaborative" I also consider "inclusive". I am not part of a minority, so this is something that is obviously difficult to assess for me. But it goes without saying that the research environment should feel safe and inclusive for anyone working in it.</p>

<p>The one way I experience a form of oppression is actually a point I would say I actually did have a rough time. I come from a very poor family. Money issues were super rough for me. Before covid, I constantly debated submitting to conferences etc because I knew there was very little chance I would be able to afford the plane ticket and staying in a hotel for 1 or 2 weeks. I guess many people get funding from their advisors. For some time I did, but paying up front was still a burden. For a majority of my time, I did not get funding. I've given up several critical experiences because I simply couldn't afford to go. I skipped a summer school at the Fields institute, I didn't submit anything to CT or ACT last year, just to name a few.</p>

<p>I'm yet to meet a grad student in America who was being paid enough to get by, that sounds so frustrating. Do you think it's a matter of undervaluing of students? It seems paradoxical that universities in America are portrayed (in films, say) as these wealthy establishments, and yet that they fail to adequately provide for their students in that way.</p>

<p>Yes, I can relate with this. I myself wasn't a funded student. My situation wasn't that bad because my family could still provide for me, but it still felt increadibly frustrating. Also, sometimes I felt like it was a Joke: Bob gave me priority for a scholarhip but not being British someone else got precedence. Also, coming from a country that considers culture as basically a bad thing, there wasn't any government scholarship I could access to. I managed to solve the situation by working in the CompSci department for a bit (thanks again to Bob) and by finishing my PhD in two years (thus avoiding paying taxes for my 3rd year)</p>

<p>I see this from 2013: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Harvard University recently announced a renewed effort to attract applications from qualified low-income and middle-income students across the country. </p>
<p>To address this problem, Harvard’s message is fairly simple. Few realize that Harvard’s financial aid programs pay 100 percent of tuition, fees, room, and board for students from families earning less than $65,000 a year. Families with incomes from $65,000 to $150,000 pay between zero and 10 percent of their income. This means that, for 90 percent of families earning less than $150,000, a Harvard education is competitive with or less expensive than a public university in a student’s home state. Harvard stresses that most of the students qualifying for financial aid (about 60 percent of undergraduates) also receive travel allowances to keep them connected with home. Harvard also points out that a quarter of its current students come from families with less than $80,000 in annual income.</p>

<p>So, they started doing this before 2013.   Other rich universities have been gradually following them into this practice, as a kind of competition heats up for really top-notch undergraduate students who aren't so rich.</p>

<p>For sure Oxford (at least for PhDs, and until 2 years ago) has different scholarships if you are British, European or Overseas. These categories are strict, so for instance imagine that you have 10, 3 and 1 scholarhips for British, European and overseas students respectively. They order the students according to evaluations to give a scholarship. Now if you are overseas, and in 4th position, but there is another overseas student before you, you won't get the scholarship, even if Brithish/European students after you will</p>

<p>Harvard can do whatever it wants, and I see that free tuitions are for international students too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If your family's income is less than $65,000, you'll pay nothing. Families who earn more than $150,000 may still qualify for financial aid. For more than ninety percent of American families, Harvard costs less a public university. All students receive the same aid regardless of nationality or citizenship.</p>

<p>Alright, I shall ask <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275914">@Joe Moeller</span>. What are things like at U.C.Riverside? You've mentioned a few general points, but when you tell people about your PhD experience, what do you say? What has made a lasting impact on you, good or bad? And what can we, as a community who wants to support and include people at all levels, do to contribute positively to that experience, now or in the future?<br>
That's a lot of big questions, so no pressure to tackle all of them. I'll also leave this open to anyone who wants to contribute; I may move it to <a class="stream" data-stream-id="241990" href="/#narrow/stream/241990-general.3A-values">#general: values</a> if it gets broader, but for now the experience of doing category theory as a student seems on topic for this stream.</p>

<p>I can chime in a little bit (okay, now that I've written it, maybe it's not so "little" of a bit after all.  <em>Mea culpa!</em>) with my grad student experience at UC Riverside, which concluded a few years ago.  My office was basically my home away from home, despite the A/C being set a bit too low for my comfort.</p>
<p>While the culture seems fairly inclusive, my time there was not devoid of drama.  I tried to avoid the drama as much as possible, so I can't really say much aside from it seeming to be fairly infrequent.  The most involved I got was when I got called in as a potential witness to an incident that I was too socially oblivious to notice – I had to be told there was drama and that it had escalated.  There was only one other awkward incident I can recall.  That awkward incident took place during my first year, when I heard a rumor about some... impropriety that one of my cohort was supposedly involved in.  That classmate didn't care much for the location and left UC Riverside after one year.  The desert climate is not for everybody.</p>
<p>One of the things I really appreciated was the system that had been set up for grad students who were nearly done to mentor first- and second-year grad students.  A lot of opportunities were disseminated through large meetings, but others were circulated more impactfully through the grad student network.  Horizontally through a cohort, and vertically through the mentorships.<br>
There is also a fairly strong rapport between the grad students and the postdoc professors (VAPs).  There are frequent venues for grad students, VAPs, and tenured/tenure-track professors to engage in both mathematical and social interaction, making it feel like a big family.  When it came time to pick an advisor, I did not have any want for professors I felt I could work well with.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, my office was basically my home away from home – I spent many late nights working on stuff and studying, so I got to know some of the janitorial staff, too.  While I couldn't communicate much of the mathematics I was working on with them, I was able to practice communicating general outlines and talk about other kinds of life stuff.  Different skin and different primary languages, but still family.</p>
<p>One of the values I saw on display at UC Riverside is a commitment to the local community.  I was able to participate in many outreach opportunities to students at secondary schools, for instance, and I was able to do a bit of mentoring of undergraduate students, which incidentally included Joe Moeller at the time.  I'm not sure how much impact I had, but it was gratifying to see him as a grad student shortly after that.<br>
As Joe noted, there are travel grants available for students to attend conferences, but you have to pay the expenses up front and get compensated up to the per-conference and per-year caps.  I was able to take advantage of this to go to Oxford to present at QPL, and the reimbursement process was fairly easy.  It's not an ideal travel funding situation for low-income grad students, but I don't know what an ideal travel funding solution would be.  If the funds were provided up-front, I don't think they would be as easy to obtain.</p>
<p>Another financial consideration that I had was a bit more unusual.  Because I had started taking courses towards a Master's Degree elsewhere before taking some time off and restarting at UC Riverside, I had too many graduate level credits to qualify for some of the scholarships I investigated during my first year.  The financial aid package I got was enough to cover most of my expenses, but I still had to take student loans to finish up.  The financial aide package had a GPA requirement that gave some room for having a bad quarter, but not if the bad quarter was the first quarter.  That added some stress near the beginning, which went away over time as I built up a buffer on my GPA.</p>
<p>A somewhat off-topic, but amusing (I think) anecdote is that I managed to get an F in one of my core classes as a grad student.  I re-took the class and got an A, but the professor that gave me the F is the one that ended up hooding me at my graduation.</p>
<p>So I certainly struggled through some aspects of the Ph.D. program at UC Riverside.  Let's just say I'm thankful I had second chances on each of my written quals.  I was able to see the written qual system get streamlined a bit while I was still there (but after I had finished all of them - oh well).  While there is some prep support for the written quals, it did not seem like there was much support afterwards when failing some of them.  I tried to fill that gap where I could once I passed all my written quals, as an example that it's possible to have a rocky start but still make it through successfully, given a bit of tenacity.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to see if there are significant differences in the experiences of current or recent female graduate students at UC Riverside.  I hold my brothers and sisters in equal regard, but there may be some institutional biases that are not obvious from looking at the experiences of just one person.</p>

<p>Thanks for sharing that, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="309257">@Jason Erbele</span>. It sounds like there are a lot more hoops that you have to jump through as a grad student in the US than I'm being subjected to in Italy, which is very interesting. The expense reimbursement system sounds similar, though.<br>
I wonder if a possible solution would be for the school to book travel and/or accommodation on the behalf of students who need that. While setting up that system would involve a significant network-building effort on the part of university staff internationally (and that effort could take years), I don't think that it's unfeasible, since the likely result will be a net gain for universities and a better relationship with students. It's one of those things where the only real obstacle is the inertia of entrenched bureaucracy. Or maybe I'm being too idealistic?</p>

</ul>

<p>It's a nice list. The question for most people thinking of doing a PhD, though, is how to ascertain that the environment they're entering can fulfil those criteria. There may not necessarily be an opportunity to choose, but if there's a choice, what clues should they look for that'd indicate that the essentials you've listed are there?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'd say a good place to start for any person wanting to do a PhD at a certain institution/department, is to ask some PhD students that are currently working there how they feel about PhD life there. Although there might be some self-selection in that if you were to ask current PhD students, then you are not asking people who quit being PhD students due to the environment being hostile or the supervisor being incompetent.</p>

<p>I would be very open to receiving this kind of enquiry, but when I tried something similar myself I was in contact with someone too shy to give me much insight.<br>
I should also point out that the entry to graduate education in the UK and Europe is somewhat different to how it is in America. As I saw it, in order to even consider a graduate education in category theory, I had to first find a particular person or a particular research group to work in: there are few enough PhD places going around that if your subject isn't the target of a particular funding initiative, universities are typically restricted to giving out at most one scholarship per supervisor, and so you had better be the top choice of someone in order to have them advocating for you...<br>
If I had found myself in an established research group, I might have had some leeway about who precisely would end up supervising my thesis, but as things stand I work in a small department where the only person doing topos theory is my advisor, and where the remainder of the (small) cohort do numerical analysis or more applied areas. I got lucky; my relationship with my advisor has been a generally good one, but the relevant point is that there were no students preceding me who could have given me useful information to help me determine whether it would be a good fit for me.</p>

<p>I was talking about my experiences in the UK/Europe. I should also note that at the time I was applying, I was averse to reaching out to people in computer science departments, since I thought (and I suppose still think) of myself as a pure mathematician, and couldn't imagine myself fitting into computer science. That left me with a very limited number of people in the UK whom I could ask, which is how I ended up looking further afield to Europe.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span> Did you mean to say there are more professors taking grad students in the U.S. who call themselves homotopy type theorists than there are who call themselves category theorists?  That seems a little dubious to me.</p>

<p>Which US professors call themselves category theorists these days?  I do sometimes, just because I feel someone should.   Do you or Emily Riehl do it?  I know Julie Bergner stoutly disavows it, calling herself a homotopy theorist.   If there are more self-proclaimed category theorists out there - professors in the US, that is - I'd like to know about it.</p>

<p>I mean in IT people protest a lot because university is not totally free unless your income is really low. Many people believe it should be free for everyone. Still, I don't think this gives EU a real advantage in terms of getting the best students:<br>
First, even if you come here to study you need to cover your living expenses most often than not (uni may be free but rent is not)<br>
Second, and most importantly, one realizes how bad a situation is only when exposed to comparison. As for healthcare, I think many north American people are simply not aware of what "real welfare" is. I myself was very critical, say, of IT healthcare until I went living abroad. Then I realized that a lot of things I gave for granted are actually the exception and not the rule. E.g. in IT if you get ill all care is free. Living abroad I found out this is not the case in many countries (e.g. you have to pay for surgery, hospitalization, etc). And this shocked me quite a bit. As of now, I'd never eschange my IT healthcare with something else.</p>

<p><em>During</em> COVID the peripatetic lifestyle is out.   <em>Post</em>-COVID we may have a world-wide recession, which will make it harder for many people to get jobs, and harder to get money too.... but I don't think we're seeing the end of the era of frequent air travel, even though that would be very good for the planet and I hope it happens eventually.</p>

<p>At the risk of displaying lots of naivete and ignorance, is it really common, even in the US, to accumulate <em>debt</em> from a PhD program in mathematics?  I know that <em>undergraduates</em> generally accumulate ridiculous amounts of debt, and that graduate students aren't exactly well-paid, but my impression was that PhD students in mathematics usually receive teaching or TA jobs that pay approximately enough to live on as well as remit their nominal "tuition".  That was certainly my own experience 10-20 years ago, and I don't recall it seeming at all unusual at the time.  Or are we talking about fields other than mathematics?</p>

<p>Yes <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276777">@Mike Shulman</span> I consider myself to be a higher category theorist primarily, and an aspiring homotopy type theorist. At present I spend considerably more time thinking about higher category theory than homotopy type theory, but I expect that balance to shift some much, especially now that so many of my students (<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="315499">@tslil</span>, David Jaz Myers, Anthony Agwu) are interested in homotopy type theory. I agree with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276777">@Mike Shulman</span>'s implicit point that it would be better if there were more experts in homotopy type theory in the US who were in a position to take PhD students. But since there aren't enough, I'm trying to do my best to advise students in that direction as a novice. (Frankly, my students don't seem to need a ton of guidance, so this works out.)</p>

<p>On the subject of PhD stipends, my understanding is that they correlate pretty strongly with the wealth of the institution. At the rich private schools-- such as the University of Chicago, where <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276777">@Mike Shulman</span>, Nick Gurski, and I all studied, or at Johns Hopkins--the expectation is that they will provide a living wage with reasonable working conditions (at least for mathematicians; the situation isn't always so rosy in the humanities). Unlike in Europe, PhD students are required to do a fair amount of teaching to "earn" their stipends, but since the graduate student positions are funded in part by the ludicrous tuition paid by our undergraduates, there tend to be more PhD places, and these aren't tied to a specific grant held by the thesis advisor (again in mathematics; it's different in CS or in the sciences). </p>
<p>I'm less familiar with the working conditions at less-wealthy institutions but my impression is that it can be challenging to finance a PhD. If some of you felt comfortable sharing more about your experiences, I'd be grateful to learn more about this. And even at the wealthier schools, a PhD stipend doesn't go very far if, say, you have family members you are trying to support.</p>

<p>If you read this, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277432">@Emily Riehl</span> - who are the "category theorists" in the US who can take grad students?  Sometimes I think it's just you and me and Nick Gurski and maybe <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276777">@Mike Shulman</span>?    I guess I could also count Steve Awodey, but does he consider himself a category theorist these days or a homotopy type theorist?  (Maybe more importantly: could a student of his learn a lot of category theory and "become a category theorist"?)   I am probably forgetting other people.   I want to know because kids ask me about these things.</p>

<p>I can't advise PhD students myself, because as you say we don't have a graduate program in mathematics.  I am happy to work with graduate students at other universities to help them "become category theorists" (or homotopy type theorists), and occasionally I can even suggest thesis topic ideas.  But they do need an actual advisor at another institution who can meet with them regularly and understand something of what they're doing.</p>

<p>I would like to chime in here to ask some questions.  This thread here contains a lot of information I'm very interested in, because right now I'm trying to figure out some plan(s) for my PhD!</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span> , I'd been thinking about applying to US universities for grad school because it seemed like there's a lot of people in the US doing cool stuff in ACT and Category Theory more generally (and also because, given that my background is Physics, not Math, focusing on taking a lot of math classes during the first year or two sounds nice to my ears). However, based on the questions you are asking I think perhaps I misjudged the situation in that respect: there might be a bigger community of people around Category Theory but the actual opportunities for doing a PhD in Category Theory in the US wouldn't be so many. Is that so?</p>

<p>By the way, I don't think a "PhD in category theory" is a wise idea if you're trying to maximize your chance of getting good jobs either in academia or industry.   It would probably be better to get a PhD in something else - but something that uses a lot of category theory.  Then you can label yourself as an expert in that "something else".</p>
<p>If you're interested in applied category theory this should not be very hard to do.</p>

<p>Yes, there's Emily Riehl, there's me, and there's "all the ACT people at MIT", which is a somewhat grandiose way of saying David Spivak and his postdocs.

<p>I don't know about elsewhere and I don't particularly know about a math PhD but don't expect any professor to give you a problem to solve not in the least for a PhD caliber, you'll have to work on that by yourself and that's partially what makes a PhD: starting from a vague big picture point and narrowing down. The job of the advisor is often to keep reminding the student to keep narrowing and narrowing. Of course this largely depends on your advisor as well. But generally, having seen many of my peers and friends drop out as anecdotal evidence it was always the ones with no problem but a tool, e.g., I want to use neural nets or deep learning or control etc.</p>

<p>Yes it is, and you should take advantage of that!  But maybe Giorgios was saying that the problem - whoever chooses it - should determine the tools, not the other way around.   </p>
<p>This is probably more true in his field than mine.  In math we often start by getting good at some tools and then figure out problems they can solve.  Not always, though!</p>

<p>In math, if your thesis advisor doesn't give you a bunch of problems to work on and give you a lot of help solving them, you should quickly get another professor.  This is what thesis advisors are for! </p>
<p>It takes a lot of practice finding <em>important</em> yet <em>doable</em> problems in mathematics, and few grad students are able to do that.  Of course some do.  But I always give each of my students an array of problems to work on, most of which I know how to do myself, at least roughly.  They often turn out to be harder than I expected, but then it's my job to work with student to overcome these obstacles.</p>

<p>Also, what is "just a tool" to someone can be a vast source of problems for someone else.

<p>The story of what you need to bring to the table before starting a PhD is certainly different if you venture in a purer direction. For anyone treating toposes (my own area of study) as a tool, the overhead cost of understanding them is so prohibitively high, even after decades of research and a bunch of textbooks on them, that they're unlikely to get very far if they start off with intentions that are too specific-problem-focused. In some sense the study of topos-theory could be described in <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275927">@James Fairbanks</span>' terms as a study of "a solution with <em>some</em> problems, in search of more problems to solve", since we already know that there are things that toposes are useful for... but the scope of topos theory is so vast that there are plenty of open questions on the seam between interesting and accessible. That includes questions that will certainly open the door to applications sooner or later, even if they aren't applied in themselves.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277473">@[Mod] Morgan Rogers</span> I definitely am thinking more about the research spectrum of including applied math through engineering. In my understanding, a major goal of the ACT community is to do the pedagogical and research work  to bring abstract math from CT and get it close enough to practical problems that we can change how engineers think about using math in their work. This is one of the reason I think CT4S and 7Sketches are such great contributions, they make it possible for people to see the value of the CT approach without needing to learn a bunch of graduate level math.</p>

<p>Of course! That pedagogical flow extends all the way along the spectrum into pure maths, though: while I'm working on topos theory, my own goals are to advance it to a point where it is more accessible to mathematicians who don't yet consider it relevant to them. Most of them are pure mathematicians for the time being, but even if topos theory only produces theorems that justify intuition that inspires applications in three decades time, I will still have played my own part in that process.</p>
