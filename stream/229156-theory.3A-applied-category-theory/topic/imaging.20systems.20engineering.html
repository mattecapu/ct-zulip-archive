<p>I am interested in better understanding imaging systems structurally.<br>
For example, I would like to understand:<br>
-Can we build up more complicated systems for forming images by sticking together smaller systems?<br>
-Is there an underlying mathematical similarity between different imaging systems? (And if so, can we translate understanding about imaging from one system to another?)<br>
-What enables imaging systems to work? If we stick together a bunch of pieces to form an imaging system, when will the resulting system also work properly? How does information flow around between the different pieces of imaging systems?</p>
<p>I have been doing research in an engineering medical imaging lab. My experience is that thinking of new ideas for imaging systems is often hit-or-miss, and implementation for testing is often slow and expensive. I'm wondering if answering some of the above questions will help accelerate concept iteration and better enable cross-context communication (e.g. between MRI researchers and ultrasound researchers).</p>
<p>My training is in engineering. However, I've seen expressed here the idea that category theory has something to contribute to engineers. I'm hopeful that its ability to provide a language for structure and for translation between structures might be of some use for this problem.</p>
<p>I'm just getting started, and am wanting to understand what work has already been done in this direction, and what categorical ideas I need to become more familiar with in order to make progress on this. However, this feels a bit daunting as I've not done a project that makes use of category theory before. Honestly, I'm not even sure what kind of coarseness I should be trying to model imaging systems at!</p>
<p>Is there somewhere a resource along the lines of "Using Applied Category Theory: An Engineer's Guide"? Failing that, perhaps there are some really good examples of how people have modelled systems using categories?</p>
<p>How can I get started as an (imaging system) engineer with applied category theory?<br>
Any thoughts are much appreciated.</p>

<p>So right now there's a few engineering-focussed people in the applied category theory, but not many. They tend to be focussed on systems engineering, which might be good because it sounds to me like you're really asking systems engineering questions</p>

<p>I agree wth Jules, there's certainly an ongoing effort in bringing more engineering into ACT at the moment, but there's still so much work to do. Fields that are already active in this sense are mainly related to dynamical and cyberphysical systems.</p>

<p>That said, one important issue in ACT right now is that many of us are pure mathematicians that would like to help by applying categorical techniques to various fields, but they do not know where to start: Interaction with domain specialists is paramount right now to bootstrap things.

<p>I'm no engineer but the first question I would ask is, what do you think could be special about imaging systems in particular to distinguish them from general systems, from the perspective of what category theory could be useful. This could either be from something inherent to the systems, or from the type of questions people like to ask about them</p>

<p>That's a good question; also perhaps a hard question, depending on how much <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277503">@David Egolf</span> has thought about imaging systems versus other systems, particularly from a mathematical (i.e. abstract) viewpoint.</p>

<p>There's a lot of nice category theory lurking in elementary optics, by which I mean the theory of lenses - actual lenses, not the things category theorists call lenses.   Lenses can be seen as morphisms in a category, and to a first approximation they give symplectic linear maps.  This is discussed at the start of Guillemin and Sternberg's <em>Symplectic Techniques in Physics</em>.  But any serious sort of modern imaging system would go much further than this, I imagine.</p>

<p>A thought provoking question was asked above, along the lines of: What characterizes an imaging system as compared to other systems? Answering this will help to create a model with sufficient detail (specialized to imaging systems) that adds complexity specific to answering questions about imaging system.</p>
<p>I had some thoughts on this topic, although they are not precise.</p>
<p>I am most familiar with ultrasound imaging, and will use examples from that context to help provide concreteness. In brief, ultrasound imaging works like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is some target we want to image (e.g. a portion of the heart in a patient)</li>
<li>The transmit array creates a pulse of ultrasound (high frequency sound) which then propagates into the body</li>
<li>The ultrasound scatters off the heart, this scattering being induced by variations in density and the speed of sound</li>
<li>The resulting echo propagates outwards and part of this echo is sensed by a receive array of sensors, each which generates a voltage over time signal. These receive signals are saved in a computer.</li>
<li>The recorded receive data is then processed to form an image (e.g. of the heart)</li>
</ol>
<p>So, what distinguishes an imaging system?</p>
<p>First, imaging systems are communication systems. Here is a diagram form a 1948 paper by Shannon of a communication system:<br>
<a href="/user_uploads/21317/4X1gYpGHRDE1vqjcyiUgh5mt/image.png">Communication System</a> </p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/21317/4X1gYpGHRDE1vqjcyiUgh5mt/image.png" title="Communication System"><img src="/user_uploads/21317/4X1gYpGHRDE1vqjcyiUgh5mt/image.png"></a></div><p>Consequently, imaging systems have a starting point and an ending point. The start is where the message is generated (e.g. biological processes generate the heart in some state). The end is where an image is displayed to the user (e.g. the display screen of an ultrasound machine). Diagrammatically, the bare-bones structure of an imaging system looks like this: o---o---o---o---o.</p>
<p>Second, imaging systems are often composed of smaller imaging systems. For example, consider the human vision system. This system is composed of two eyes, together with the brain. If we close an eye, the remaining subsystem is still able to form images. On a smaller scale, the rods and cones of the eye can be viewed as inducing even smaller imaging systems. The whole imaging system is then formed by combining together these smaller imaging pieces of hardware, together with appropriately more sophisticated processing. Similarly, in an ultrasound setting, the transmit array which generates the ultrasound wave is composed of many small transmitting elements, and the receive array is composed of many small sensing elements. On a higher level, multi-modal imaging systems seek to combine information from multiple sources to provide a more comprehensive picture (e.g. a camera and an ultrasound system in an endoscopy probe). Diagrammatically, the bare-bones "gluing" process might look like this: two simpler imaging systems o---o---o---o---o and o---o---o---o---o together yield a more complicated imaging system:<br>

<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/21317/pxNj-AU-6pkx1GPj1_GxesjN/image.png" title="Composite Imaging System"><img src="/user_uploads/21317/pxNj-AU-6pkx1GPj1_GxesjN/image.png"></a></div><p>Note that multiple sub-imaging systems can be combined across time, not just across space. For example, in ultrasound imaging, it is common to send pulses of ultrasound towards the target from several different angles. These different pulses are usually sent at different times. The final image formed then incorporates all the data collected from each angle.</p>
<p>Third, we care about the imaging speed and imaging quality of an imaging system. We care about the speed at which an image of a given quality can be produced, and the quality of the images produced at a given speed. Quality is hard to assess in general, but includes things like "contrast" and "resolution", and is probably related to the mutual information between the messages generated (e.g. the distribution generating heart tissues) and the images produced (e.g. ultrasound images of the heart). Imaging speed corresponds to how long it takes to generate an image. In an ultrasound setting, this often corresponds to the number of times we send ultrasound transmission into the body.</p>
<p>So, in summary: imaging systems are communication systems, often composed of smaller imaging systems glued together, and we care about their speed and image quality. The hope is that noting that they are distinguished in this way will help us model them effectively. </p>
<p>I'm guessing this is not at the level of precision we need to start making mathematical models right away, but hopefully it can provide a springboard for further discussion.</p>

<p>I've started to try and categorify things! I don't know much category theory, so I would be very happy to hear about better ways to do this.</p>
<p>As a first attempt, we can model imaging systems like this:<br>
<a href="/user_uploads/21317/9b0S0ZFYUn2jTH1GEqDBtXM3/Pasted-image-20201209093748.png">Imaging System Model</a></p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/21317/9b0S0ZFYUn2jTH1GEqDBtXM3/Pasted-image-20201209093748.png" title="Imaging System Model"><img src="/user_uploads/21317/9b0S0ZFYUn2jTH1GEqDBtXM3/Pasted-image-20201209093748.png"></a></div><p>where M is the message, t is the transmission, S is the signal, o is the observation, R is the received data, p is the processing, and I is the image. For now, these are just objects and arrows in some category.</p>
<p>I want to define a category that allows us to compare imaging systems. As a first guess, vertical maps look like this: <br>
<a href="/user_uploads/21317/2FseDItu5jUBAlzbkdTqWORs/Pasted-image-20201209095312.png">Map <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>ρ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\rho</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">ρ</span></span></span></span> between Imaging Systems</a></p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/21317/2FseDItu5jUBAlzbkdTqWORs/Pasted-image-20201209095312.png" title="Map "><img src="/user_uploads/21317/2FseDItu5jUBAlzbkdTqWORs/Pasted-image-20201209095312.png"></a></div><p>where each square is required to commute. I believe that this creates a category of imaging systems. As far as I can tell, there is an arrow from imaging system A to imaging system B when you can calculate everything in B from things in A. So, if <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi><mo>↦</mo><mi>B</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A \mapsto B</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.69433em;vertical-align:-0.011em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">A</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mrel">↦</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05017em;">B</span></span></span></span> then A "observes at least as much" as B.</p>
<p>I want to be able to describe the process of sticking together two imaging systems, as many real imaging systems are composed of many smaller imaging systems combined. One way to maybe do this is with a span that is a sort of terminal object, taking inspiration from the little bit I've heard about modeling with structured cospans:<br>
<a href="/user_uploads/21317/LnjfyGqI5-Pl2ng2XN6j2oCI/Pasted-image-20201209092833.png">Combining imaging systems</a> </p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/21317/LnjfyGqI5-Pl2ng2XN6j2oCI/Pasted-image-20201209092833.png" title="Combining imaging systems"><img src="/user_uploads/21317/LnjfyGqI5-Pl2ng2XN6j2oCI/Pasted-image-20201209092833.png"></a></div><p>Here A and B are smaller imaging systems. A+B is then the imaging system defined by being the "least observant" system that observes at least as much as A and B, as it is required to observe no more than any imaging system C that observes at least as much as A and B.</p>
<p>So, I think this defines a way to combine two imaging systems. There are limitations with this, but I'll stop here for now in case someone has some thoughts about this approach.</p>

<p>Cospans and structured cospans get more interesting when you use them to connect systems to each other.  Any sort of machine or system made of parts has a good chance of being describable using these.  That's why I've been obsessed with structured cospans.</p>

<p>Your diagrams are now the correct definitions of product and coproduct.   But A+B is not like an intersection, usually: in the category of sets it's the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_union">disjoint union</a>", where we put two sets side by side.</p>

<p>The point is that both A and B map into A+B, so it has to be "big enough to contain both".</p>

<p>That is, the dual of David's category can be understood as a concrete category where we would indeed expect the coproduct to behave as a disjoint union. But what David has said seems to make sense to me based on his setup!</p>

<p>There are some problems with the above approach. I'm describing them here on the off-chance that someone else knows of ways to get around them.</p>
<p>I'm realizing that this model for imaging systems is a bit coarse. We don't see explicitly in the model all of the pieces that an engineer is choosing to put into the system. For example, the pieces of hardware used as sensors are only incorporated implicitly in the map <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>o</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">o</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">o</span></span></span></span>, which describes how observations are performed.</p>
<p>As a (probably related) problem, sticking together two imaging systems using the product (or even just a span) is too idealized to model how we often stick together imaging systems in practice. This is because the definition of a morphism from imaging system <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">A</span></span></span></span> to <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>B</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">B</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05017em;">B</span></span></span></span> requires <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">A</span></span></span></span> to be able to observe everything that <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>B</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">B</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05017em;">B</span></span></span></span> can observe, and this is too stringent a condition. In practice, when we stick on another imaging component to our current system (e.g. add another sensor), the resulting system often can no longer observe everything that it could originally observe. So, if <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>S</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">S</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05764em;">S</span></span></span></span> is the imaging system after we add another sensor, and <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">A</span></span></span></span> was the original imaging system, often there will be no morphism from <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>S</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">S</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05764em;">S</span></span></span></span> to <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">A</span></span></span></span>. So, we can't relate the new system to the old system under this definition of morphism.</p>
<p>Both of these reasons make me think we need a new definition of morphism between imaging systems, and probably a new definition of imaging systems too. Ideally these would be granular enough to relate all the components we want to design over, while also being relaxed enough to allow for morphisms between imaging systems in the case when neither of the two systems is strictly more observant than the other.</p>
<p>As a reminder, here is the (unsatisfactory) way I've been defining morphisms between imaging systems:<br>
<a href="/user_uploads/21317/ug9OftVz24Vyu9hbX4hvLUvC/Pasted-image-20201209144756.png">Current morphism definition.png</a></p>

<p>Can we do this in a more "relaxed" way so that morphisms more often exist between imaging systems?</p>

<p>I'm realizing a few things:<br>
-We need ways to "mix together" parts of imaging systems, not just snap them together like Lego blocks<br>
-For an imaging system model to be useful for design, it should expose hardware and processing<br>
-Before considering "translation" maps between imaging systems, we need a better model of an imaging system<br>
So, I am hopeful that reading  some more of "Seven Sketches in Compositionality" will be the way to make some progress. I would like to be able to make diagrams for imaging systems like this one from the preface:<br>

<p>The idea behind <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">o</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">b</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">s</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{obs}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.69444em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">o</span><span class="mord mathrm">b</span><span class="mord mathrm">s</span></span></span></span></span> was that, looking at the higher level picture rather than the details of the object structure, I interpret the 'imaging system category' you describe as a "hardware category", where the objects in some sense represent <em>measurement devices</em>. So <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">o</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">b</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">s</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{obs}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.69444em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">o</span><span class="mord mathrm">b</span><span class="mord mathrm">s</span></span></span></span></span> would send a device to the set of measurements it can make, or possibly to something more structured than a set, such as a collection consisting of the sets of 'interpretable messages', 'signals', 'data', and 'image', plus the mediating maps between them that you originally described as being the internal structure of the objects. After all, if you're considering systems, there should be a range of messages that the system can interpret, and to me it makes more sense to associate to a system its maximal set of data rather than a single instance.</p>
<p>Then <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">o</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">b</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">s</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{obs}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.69444em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">o</span><span class="mord mathrm">b</span><span class="mord mathrm">s</span></span></span></span></span> would be contravariant with respect to the comparison morphisms you originally described because a strictly more powerful system can interpret all of the messages etc. that its less powerful counterpart can, so we get a mapping, indeed an inclusion from the set of interpretable messages (etc.) of the latter into those of the former. In the end I agree that this is not the most useful definition of morphism, however.</p>

<p>Next, we set up a <em>category of imaging systems over <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="script">I</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathcal{I}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathcal" style="margin-right:0.07382em;">I</span></span></span></span></span></em>. The objects of this category will represent physical systems; the precise nature of the morphisms I shall leave up to your discretion. Since imaging systems can be "composed in parallel", it makes some sense to make this a monoidal category. Since the parallel composition can be imperfect (and I want to avoid extra hassle at the next stage) I would advise making your morphisms flexible enough to make sense of a morphism <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>A</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>⊗</mo><msub><mi>A</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo>→</mo><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A_1 \otimes A_2 \to A</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.83333em;vertical-align:-0.15em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal">A</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.30110799999999993em;"><span style="top:-2.5500000000000003em;margin-left:0em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">1</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.15em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;"></span><span class="mbin">⊗</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.83333em;vertical-align:-0.15em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal">A</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.30110799999999993em;"><span style="top:-2.5500000000000003em;margin-left:0em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">2</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.15em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mrel">→</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">A</span></span></span></span> which compares an idealised parallel composition of two systems to the realistic composite system you actually care about.

<p>The main goal of structuring a model in this way is that you can encode the subtleties of how the hardware fits together in <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="script">S</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathcal{S}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathcal" style="margin-right:0.075em;">S</span></span></span></span></span> and the subtleties of the processing in <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="script">I</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathcal{I}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathcal" style="margin-right:0.07382em;">I</span></span></span></span></span>, so these aspects are accessible but distinct. On the other hand, the set-up allows you to hide as much of that structure as is useful when reasoning about these systems at a high level, for example when you're in the early stages of design of a new system and you don't know exactly what ingredients will be present yet.</p>
<p>That last point is what I view as the real motivation for making a categorical model at all: you can refine the categorical model in tandem with your physical one, distilling the crucial features into an abstract setting where you can reason about how to proceed, or you can substitute or extend <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="script">I</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathcal{I}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathcal" style="margin-right:0.07382em;">I</span></span></span></span></span> or <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="script">S</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathcal{S}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathcal" style="margin-right:0.075em;">S</span></span></span></span></span>, or indeed tweak the functor <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">o</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">b</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">s</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathrm{obs}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.69444em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathrm">o</span><span class="mord mathrm">b</span><span class="mord mathrm">s</span></span></span></span></span> to better reflect the specifics of a class of systems you care about, while carrying across any results that you were able to derive more abstractly using the features common to all of the systems you care about.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277503">@David Egolf</span> - you might find it helpful to take a certain limited very precisely defined class of imaging systems and mathematically formalize the things you actually do with them.    "Imaging systems" seems like a broad and rather vague class to me, in part because I don't know much about imaging systems.  What are we actually talking about here?   Can you pick a very few kinds of imaging systems and work out the category theory of what we actually do with these, in great detail?   </p>
<p>I found this approach helpful when working on the category theory of electrical circuits.  Circuits made of just resistors are sort of boring and well-understood, but I decided it was worthwhile understanding them using category theory, as a warmup before studying more complicated circuits.  And indeed it turned out to be very useful!  My student Brendan Fong spent a couple of years on this and invented the framework of <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/05/01/decorated-cospans/">decorated cospans</a>, which turned out to be useful very generally for describing systems made by sticking components together.  Using this we wrote a paper on <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2015/04/28/a-compositional-framework-for-passive-linear-networks/">passive linear electrical circuits</a> - e.g. resistors, inductors and capacitors.   </p>
<p>The whole project took about 5 years, which shows that it can take time to figure out even simple things.  But we learned a lot of lessons that apply much more generally, and Brendan explained them quite well in his thesis:</p>

<p>I think the ideas he discovered could be useful to you, but even more I think it could be useful to follow the same strategy, where you start by focusing on a precisely limited small sub-class of the problems you're interested in, and then generalize later.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277473">@[Mod] Morgan Rogers</span> Thanks for the detailed response! It was helpful. I don't fully follow all the details of what you said, but I'm hopeful that Seven Sketches will help with that (e.g. the definition of a functor from a monoidal category).</p>
<p>If I understand correctly, some of the major points from your post are:<br>
-Modeling hardware and processing in separate categories might be useful<br>
-Similarly, modelling general aspects (e.g. structure of information flow) separately from specific aspects (e.g. specific hardware used) and then relating the two (via a functor?) may allow for generalization of abstract insights to multiple concrete imaging systems<br>
-We can use a monoidal category to talk about composing (abstract?) imaging systems in parallel, and use this setting to relate idealized and actual combination of imaging systems. Taking a functor from this category to the "specific realization" category then should translate statements about abstract information flow into language about maps in a concrete imaging system.</p>
<p>I will keep this scheme in mind as I follow John Baez's advice to tackle a very precise class of imaging systems!</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span> <br>
Thank-you for your suggestions and the resources. They are helpful!</p>
<p>I agree that it will be valuable to focus on a smaller, precisely defined subclass of imaging systems. Before getting to that, I found your reflection on the vagueness of an "imaging system" thought provoking, and had some thoughts that might help define this better.<br>
Here are some reflections, leading to a proposed definition for "image" and "imaging system" below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Imaging systems don't always just have an "image" at the end. For example, an imaging system might generate a rough photograph, and then have further steps involving processing of this photograph. It seems arbitrary to say that the processed photograph is an image and the earlier one is not.</li>
<li>Imaging systems don't always fit well in the conceptual "message-&gt;signal-&gt;received data-&gt;image" pipeline. For example, I think horizontal composition of two imaging systems following this pattern is often meaningful. In this case, we more naturally have: "message-&gt;signal-&gt;received data-&gt;image-&gt;message-&gt;signal-&gt;receive data-&gt;image".</li>
<li>So, the four step pipeline with an image at the end has problems. To fix these problems we could maybe: (a) allow for any number of steps in the pipeline, (b) allow for the data at each step to be considered on equal footing, as an "image".</li>
</ol>
<p>These reflections indicate a better need for definition of "image". In a medical imaging setting, we generally care about images inasmuch as they let us answer a question (e.g. "is there a cyst? is there a fracture? what is the shape of some structure?"). Often this involves human interpretation, but this is not necessarily always the case - for example a simple algorithm can calculate contrast between two areas of an image. So, let us define an image to be some data <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="script">I</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathcal{I}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathcal" style="margin-right:0.07382em;">I</span></span></span></span></span> together with a question <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>Q</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">Q</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8777699999999999em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">Q</span></span></span></span>, an estimator (interpretation) algorithm <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>E</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">E</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05764em;">E</span></span></span></span>, and a distribution of possible messages <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>M</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">M</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.10903em;">M</span></span></span></span>.

<p>This model for an imaging system allows for any number of steps, and removes the (I believe) artificial distinction between data that is an image and data that is not an image. It also provides a framework for talking about the "goal" of an imaging system: makes its goodness as high as possible given design constraints.</p>

<p>I like your new thoughts, David.</p>
<p>One thing I'd like to argue is that when you start talking about "pipelines" that you can connect end to end, like "message-&gt;signal-&gt;received data-&gt;image-&gt;message-&gt;signal-&gt;receive data-&gt;image", you are really talking about <em>morphisms</em>.   It's no coincidence that you're drawing <em>arrows</em> here.</p>

<p>In a double category, one has morphisms that also act like objects, because there are "2-morphisms" going between morphisms.</p>

<p>You may wish to avoid them, but if you need them if you:</p>
<p>1) want to talk about morphisms <em>between</em> imaging systems, </p>
<p>and </p>
<p>2) also want to talk about "connecting imaging systems end to end", like taking a camera filter and attaching it to the lens of your camera, or taking the jpeg produced by a camera and putting it into some image processing software.</p>

<p>Thanks <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span> for your thoughts on double categories.<br>
I suspect you are right that I do want to use them. My thought process follows, which I provide here largely to convince myself,  and also in case it is of interest to some people.</p>
<p>To begin with, I thought of an imaging "pipeline" (e.g. message-&gt;signal-&gt;receive data-&gt;image) as a category. The morphisms are the data transformation maps, and the objects are the data we're mapping between. Then, the idea was to relate two data processing pipelines using a functor. My intuition for a functor is a "translation" of structure at one level of abstraction to (some subset of) that structure at another level of abstraction. So, the idea was to be able to describe similarities in structure in different data processing pipelines. A functor <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>F</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">F</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">F</span></span></span></span> would act like this:<br>
<a href="/user_uploads/21317/5ffPnCaWUEOEfRjHe6nMaEe3/image.png">Functor translating between data processing pipelines</a></p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/21317/5ffPnCaWUEOEfRjHe6nMaEe3/image.png" title="Functor translating between data processing pipelines"><img src="/user_uploads/21317/5ffPnCaWUEOEfRjHe6nMaEe3/image.png"></a></div><p>However, I recently realized that we want to be able to horizontally compose the data processing pipelines underlying imaging systems. This is because there isn't really a canonical "finish" to one of these pipelines, and we can often feed data from one of these pipelines to another one. In an attempt to preserve the idea of each pipeline as a category, I was thinking of this scenario like this:<br>
<a href="/user_uploads/21317/ZFxoPGvWRctsxH9wHYXIQLY8/image.png">Horizontally stitching together data processing pipelines</a></p>

However, this doesn't actually work. This is because in a category we need to be able to compose morphisms. Assume we have pipelines connected with these connecting data transformations like this: A -p-&gt; B -q-&gt; C. Then, if we populate pipeline <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>A</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">A</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">A</span></span></span></span> with some data it's handing off to <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">p</span></span></span></span>, then this data arrives to <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>C</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">C</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07153em;">C</span></span></span></span> after we apply <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>p</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">p</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">p</span></span></span></span>, all the processing in <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>B</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">B</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05017em;">B</span></span></span></span>, and <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>q</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">q</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">q</span></span></span></span>.

<p>So, the horizontally composed pipelines don't really act like objects with respect to horizontal composition. As you pointed out, they <em>do</em> act like morphisms: we can compose them nicely to get a bigger processing pipeline. In addition, this avoids an artificial distinction between pipelines and "transition maps" feeding the output of one to the input of the other: every processing map is on an equal footing as a morphism.</p>
<p>However, I do still want to relate imaging systems to each other. So, why not use functors for this, just viewing the entire processing pipeline as a category? The main downside I can think of is that this seems conceptually awkward, as it would require us to change the category we are working in every time we add another step to our processing pipeline.</p>
<p>It sounds like double categories could do what I want in a streamlined way: allow for horizontal composition of pipelines (viewed as morphisms) and then still allow for comparison of pipelines, without having to constantly change the category we are working in as we tweak a pipeline. I'm not sure exactly how the "answers a question" part of imaging systems fits into all this, but this seems reasonable for the data pipeline part of the model.</p>

<p>But what's the "answers a question" part of an imaging system?   A simple concrete example would help me understand what you mean by that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Assuming that my machine learning analogy from earlier is close enough, here is an example:</p>
<ul>
<li>We start with some raw data, such as the raw output of an xray scan of someone's hip.</li>
<li>We want to go from this data to the answer of a question, such as "is the hip broken?"</li>
<li>There is a 'perfect information' map that sends all possible iterations of xray data to their respective diagnoses, which is to say the space {"yes", "no", "that's not a hip, it's a fossilized t-rex fibia", ...}</li>
<li>However, this map is hard to present in terms of the raw data! So we have an image processing pipeline.</li>
<li>Processing inevitably loses information, but the aim is that we should be discarding irrelevant information, so that we can still get a faithful approximation to the 'perfect information' map.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this example, the raw xray data is transformed into one or more images, and that data is passed to a doctor, and the doctor makes a diagnosis. Or the image is processed further to highlight any relevant features, resulting in a more accurate diagnosis.</p>

<p>In any case, the image is being processed with a final "question-answering" purpose in mind, and any analysis of the quality of the processing pipeline will depend on how well it fulfils this purpose!</p>

<p>Thanks.  This seems a lot more complicated than "image processing pipelines" - now we've got doctors and their diagnoses in the system.   I think we could simplify your example while preserving some essential features by making the question be "is the image a dark square on a light background?"</p>

<p>Even so, we have now left the realm of "image processing pipelines" <em>unless</em> we imagine an image processing device (perhaps a person) that takes an image as input and returns a bit as output: a yes or no answer to this question.   (Or maybe a third alternative, "unsure".)</p>

<p>That last suggestion is roughly what I was hinting at. Once we impose some conditions on what the objects are (a simple choice is big-but-finite-dimensional vector spaces), we can interpret the output, or answer to the question, as data in a comparable form to the input.</p>

<p>There's no reason not to include the doctor in the pipeline, as far as I can see! The human eye was the most sophisticated image processing system available for millennia, after all (pun incidental, but not deliberately avoided).</p>

<p>I think we do want to allow "interpretation" steps into the data processing pipeline, as it feels arbitrary to exclude them. At the same time, an imaging system is more than just a data processing pipeline - it has a goal. As described below, I think we can define an imaging system as a related <em>pair</em> of data processing pipelines.</p>

<p>These processing steps can involve the <em>formation</em> of "pictures" and <em>interpretation</em> of these. Formation might involve generating a collection of "brightness" values associated with points in space. Interpretation could involve computing the difference in brightness between two points.</p>
<p>So far this is just processing of data, but an imaging system has a purpose. In particular, it produces data that can help us measure a property of interest. So, to say that we have an imaging system we need two things: 1. some data and 2. a property of interest. We also need a relationship between these two that captures how well the data could help us measure the property of interest.</p>
<p>We can produce a property of interest by using a data pipeline <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>P</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">P</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">P</span></span></span></span> (the "property oracle"). This takes in some initial data and spits out the value of the property of interest. We can use a second data pipeline <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>E</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">E</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05764em;">E</span></span></span></span> (the "estimator") to produce some other data, which we hope is helpful for finding the value of the property.</p>
<p>Finally, we can then say that the estimator <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>E</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">E</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05764em;">E</span></span></span></span> is an "imaging system" with respect to the property oracle <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>P</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">P</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">P</span></span></span></span>, together with a measurement <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>μ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mu</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">μ</span></span></span></span> of how much the output of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>E</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">E</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05764em;">E</span></span></span></span> could in theory help us determine the output of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>P</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">P</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">P</span></span></span></span>.

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_information">Mutual information</a> can take any two random variables and tell you how much information they have in common.   It's a powerful tool.   But if I were you, I'd start by getting the double category you're alluding to worked out in an simple example or two.</p>

<p>I'm trying to write down the simplest double category that describes (some) data processing pipelines. I'm pretty new to all things category theory, so this is a slow process.</p>
<p>To form a double category, we need two categories as building blocks: the object category and the morphism category. As a starting point, I said the morphism category has objects corresponding to finite sequences of linear maps between finite dimensional vector spaces:<br>

<p>The reason I want to have maps between data processing pipelines is to help us understand similarities between imaging systems in different contexts.  For example, say we have a sequence of data processing steps that makes a photoacoustic image. In an ultrasound imaging setting, there might be an approach that is similar in spirit. I would then want there to be a morphism from the photoacoustic imaging system to the similar ultrasound imaging system.</p>
<p>When designing an imaging system, I would care about similarities between different steps in processing pipelines. For example, there might be an interesting approach for final processing done in an photoacoustic context that I could grab and try out in an ultrasound context - even though all the earlier steps in the imaging process could be different. So, I do think we care about similarities between individual steps, and not just the end result.</p>
<p>I think I would want both of the morphisms you describe to exist, but probably working out a concrete example is going to be helpful to determine that. Next on the list will be trying a more concrete example... probably with echoes in a 1D setting!</p>

<p>The problem is that a morphism from X to Y always says something much more specific and precise than "X and Y are similar in spirit" <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mrow></mrow><mn>1</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">{}^1</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8141079999999999em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord"></span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.8141079999999999em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">1</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> </p>
<p>Thus, to define the morphisms  in a category, you have to think about <em>exactly</em>what you want them to be.  When you're done you'll be able to say things like "there are exactly 6 morphisms from X to Y" and know what this means.</p>

<p>Thanks as always for your thoughts!</p>
<p>I understand that morphisms must be defined precisely. However, I wasn't proposing "similarity in spirit" as a definition of a morphism, but rather as a motivating philosophy for design. The challenge then is how to capture aspects of similarity in a precise way.</p>
<p>I can think of two different approaches to applying category theory to capture similarity between pipelines:<br>
1) Start with a guess at what a category describing pipelines could look like. Then use category theory to automatically generate some notions of similarity in this setting. Hope that these notions are relevant to application.</p>
<p>2) Start with some concrete examples of pipelines and try to describe what aspects of similarity in these examples are relevant to application. Then use category theory to encode these aspects precisely. </p>
<p>I think I've been proceeding along the lines of (1) so far. If I understand you correctly, you are proposing an approach more along the lines of (2). I like approach (2). It is challenging in that it requires us to figure out relevant aspects of similarity between pipelines on our own (instead of using category theory to automatically generate interesting notions of similarity). However, this is probably a good challenge.</p>

<p>I keep recommending approach (2) because it's so easy to spend a lot of time drifting around in lovely fields of mathematics if you don't have a really concrete example in mind that you're trying to formalize.   Also, trying to formalize vague concepts like "similarity in spirit" is ridiculously hard without a very concrete example to pin things down.</p>

<p>The above concrete example has been helpful for reflecting on when I consider imaging systems to be "similar". Here are some examples of imaging systems I would consider similar in some way to the above example, which I will call the "reference system":<br>

-The reference system, except we modify one of its parameters (this includes the above examples)</p>
<p>Here are some other systems that seemed similar to the reference system to me, but are more different from the reference system:<br>
-A photoacoustic imaging system, different from the reference system except in its sampling hardware and sampling rate<br>
-An MRI imaging system, different from the reference system except in the target that it is imaging</p>
<p>In summary, I seem to consider two imaging systems to be similar in some way, if <em>some part</em> of these imaging systems are the same. Generalizing this a bit, I think I also consider two imaging system to be similar if they have some parts that are "compatible". By this I mean that I can grab a part from one imaging system and slot it into the other one, and this would create a well-defined imaging system. This finds practical application when writing code to simulate an imaging system. If I find an algorithm in the literature that seems better for some step being carried out for my code, then I can try copying the algorithm and putting it in the code. This can happen even if this algorithm was being used in a different imaging system.</p>
<p>Morphisms that detect "compatible" parts of imaging systems - so one can be swapped out for the other - I think detect an aspect of similarity between imaging systems that is relevant to application. (Another analogy: Say I'm building a tower out of Lego blocks, and you are building a tower out of Lego blocks. Then there might be a section in your building that has the same volume and connections to the remainder of your building  as a section in my building. I could then at least try replacing my version of that part of the tower with your version of that part of the tower. The tower might collapse, but it's something I can try at least. So, in this sense, our two towers are similar.)</p>

<p>Based on the above discussion, we want morphisms to detect compatible parts of imaging pipelines, so that one part could be swapped out for the other. Let us try to make this idea precise.</p>
<p>To start, let's consider some very simple pipelines consisting of linear maps between vector spaces:<br>
Pipeline 1: <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi mathvariant="double-struck">R</mi><mn mathvariant="double-struck">2</mn></msup><msub><mo>→</mo><mi>f</mi></msub><mi mathvariant="double-struck">R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{R^2} \to_f \mathbb{R}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1.1002159999999999em;vertical-align:-0.286108em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathbb">R</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.8141079999999999em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mrel"><span class="mrel">→</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.3361079999999999em;"><span style="top:-2.5500000000000003em;margin-left:0em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mathnormal mtight" style="margin-right:0.10764em;">f</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.286108em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68889em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathbb">R</span></span></span></span></span><br>

We want there to be a morphism that captures the fact that we can make a new pipeline from Pipeline 1 by swapping out <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8888799999999999em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.10764em;">f</span></span></span></span> for <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>g</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">g</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">g</span></span></span></span>. That is, the morphism should detect the compatibility of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8888799999999999em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.10764em;">f</span></span></span></span> and <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>g</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">g</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">g</span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>We often define morphisms between objects to take structure from the source object and find an "echo" of that structure in the target object. For example, an invertible linear map sends a subspace to a subspace of the same dimension. As another example, the image of a subgroup under a group homomorphism is again a subgroup.</p>
<p>Continuing this pattern, we will define a morphism from Pipeline 1 to Pipeline 2 to map structure into compatible structure. In this case <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8888799999999999em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.10764em;">f</span></span></span></span> is compatible with <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>g</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">g</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">g</span></span></span></span>. So, the map from Pipeline 1 to Pipeline 2 sends <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8888799999999999em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.10764em;">f</span></span></span></span> to <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>g</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">g</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">g</span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>Now we consider a case where we have non-compatible maps.<br>

<p>It is unfortunate that the above construction only detects exact equality, as "approximate equality" is more interesting from an applications perspective.

<p>This way of detecting similarity between pipelines seems a bit more detailed than described in the previous post. It doesn't just say: "this map is compatible with this one", but also compares them through the <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>α</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\alpha_i</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.58056em;vertical-align:-0.15em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.0037em;">α</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.31166399999999994em;"><span style="top:-2.5500000000000003em;margin-left:-0.0037em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mathnormal mtight">i</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.15em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>. (I suspect merely "compatible" maps are very often too different from each other to make detecting pairs of them very useful).

<p>I think this brings us close to being able to define morphisms for pipelines. It remains to check this concept makes sense with some concrete examples and then to write down a definition. I think we will end up with something like this in the case where each pipeline is a sequence of vector spaces connected by linear maps: "A morphism is a collection of linear maps <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>α</mi><mi>i</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\alpha_i</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.58056em;vertical-align:-0.15em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.0037em;">α</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.31166399999999994em;"><span style="top:-2.5500000000000003em;margin-left:-0.0037em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mathnormal mtight">i</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.15em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>, one from each source in-pipeline-object to some target in-pipeline-object, such that resulting diagram commutes and the mapping preserves the order of in-pipeline objects."</p>

<p>Now we need to properly define morphisms and their composition, starting in the special case of pipelines consisting of maps between vector spaces.</p>
<p>(I'm happy with the relevance of these morphisms to applications. In some small examples I've tried it seemed like these morphisms were able to detect levels of similarity between parts of imaging pipelines. Detecting equivalence between parts of imaging systems I think will have application to detecting secretly related imaging system aspects described using different jargon (e.g. MRI vs. ultrasound). Measuring similarity between imaging systems I think will be relevant to assessing the "non-ideality" of high speed imaging methods, by comparing them to the ideal imaging pipeline that directly extracts the property of interest.)</p>
<p>On the chance that someone here is familiar with morphisms like these, and how they should be composed, here is a picture of roughly what I want. Here is what I want a morphism to look like, where each square (and triangle!) is commutative:<br>
<a href="/user_uploads/21317/yv4CJRB5hl0df0mF4F433fup/image.png">morphism</a></p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/21317/yv4CJRB5hl0df0mF4F433fup/image.png" title="morphism"><img src="/user_uploads/21317/yv4CJRB5hl0df0mF4F433fup/image.png"></a></div><p>And here is what I want composition to look like:<br>
<a href="/user_uploads/21317/EnPbMbn0XFw56KB0oFR3iwh3/image.png">composition part 1</a><br>
<a href="/user_uploads/21317/dix-5PZRGDMlhZ4-E9bUVsPD/image.png">composition part 2</a> </p>

<p>I'll be working on trying to describe this formally, but I'm pretty new to categorical language. Any ideas on how to formalize this are appreciated.</p>

<p>I'm still making things too complicated! We can reduce complexity like this:<br>

<p>Yes, this is roughly what I had in mind.  Personally I'd go further and specify the workings of a limited class of imaging systems <em>exactly</em>, in full mathematical detail.  To do this I'd have to limit the class a lot - otherwise the chore would be immense.    But having something <em>completely</em> spelled out means there's no questions anymore about what you've got... and conversely, all the pain involved in completely spelling something out can be very useful: there are always tricky issues one hadn't expected, and facing up to those is important.</p>

<p>This idea of "generalizing the hell out of what you want to do, to make it easier" is pretty common and powerful.  For example, suppose you wanted to design a spreadsheet for prices of optical instruments.  Well, you'd probably start with a general-purpose spreadsheet program, which doesn't give a damn about whether you're talking about optical instruments.</p>

<p>If we could just use sets that would be nice. However, I'm worried that this won't capture the structure well. The "Laser" map acts in a very structured way on points in space, entirely determined by how it acts on a single point. It does correspond to a function, but it's got a lot more structure than just that. I'm not sure how damaging this would be to the resulting model.</p>

<p>If you don't know what extra structure you need... well, that's typical when one is getting started!  So a common thing to do is start with something simple, like the double category of sets I just outlined, and then see when you run into a problem that requires more structure.</p>

<p>The question of whether you treat spans as morphisms in a category, a bicategory, or a double category depends on exactly what you want to do with them.  These days I always use a double category because it's easy to get a bicategory out of that and a category out of <em>that</em>.  </p>

<p>Hmm!   To me it seems your category is fancy enough to begin with that applying the structured cospan idea to it may be overkill.   But I guess you should just try to wrestle this category to the ground and do things with it, and see what happens.</p>

<p>You would get interested in structured cospans iff you were working with "open graphs" - graphs with some vertices designated as "inputs" and "outputs" - and wanted to build big graphs by gluing together smaller open graphs.    Open graphs are the simplest interesting example of structured cospans, and Kenny and I use them as one of our main examples in our paper <a href="http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/35/48/35-48.pdf">Structured cospans</a>.</p>
<p>Since David Egolf might get interested in building bigger pipelines from gluing together smaller ones, he might want to use structured cospans.</p>

<p>We could view the above diagram as living in the double category of sets, with the arrows corresponding to horizontal arrows. I still want to use double categories (maybe with cospans) to stick shorter pipelines together end-to-end. However, I need to do some learning about double categories first.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we can still study photoacoustic pipelines with fixed length, say having three arrows. Let's introduce a category of "photoacoustic pipelines in Set" as a functor category, where objects are functor from <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mrow><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">S</mi><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">h</mi><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">a</mi><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">p</mi><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">e</mi></mrow><mn>4</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathsf{Shape}_4</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.93858em;vertical-align:-0.24414em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathsf">S</span><span class="mord mathsf">h</span><span class="mord mathsf">a</span><span class="mord mathsf">p</span><span class="mord mathsf">e</span></span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.20696799999999996em;"><span style="top:-2.4558600000000004em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">4</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.24414em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> to <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">S</mi><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">e</mi><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathsf{Set}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.69444em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathsf">S</span><span class="mord mathsf">e</span><span class="mord mathsf">t</span></span></span></span></span> and morphisms are natural transformations between these functors. The intuition is that the morphisms compare imaging systems part-by-part.</p>
<p>There are many  things in this category that don't correspond to the kind of photoacoustic imaging systems I want to model. However, it does contain the things that I want to model!</p>
<p>We can immediately add a bit more structure, though, while being able to still describe the systems I want to model. In particular, I am happy to assume that every map in every pipeline is a linear map. I'm also fine with giving each set the structure of a vector space. I have always assumed this in all the imaging system engineering I've done, so it's an interesting setting for me. (Although it's good to note that physical things in imaging systems aren't usually vector spaces - sensors have a maximum amplitude they can sense, for example. They look like parts of vector spaces though.)</p>
<p>To formalize this, we introduce the category "photoacoustic pipelines in Vect" as a functor category. The objects are functors from <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mrow><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">S</mi><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">h</mi><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">a</mi><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">p</mi><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">e</mi></mrow><mn>4</mn></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathsf{Shape}_4</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.93858em;vertical-align:-0.24414em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathsf">S</span><span class="mord mathsf">h</span><span class="mord mathsf">a</span><span class="mord mathsf">p</span><span class="mord mathsf">e</span></span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.20696799999999996em;"><span style="top:-2.4558600000000004em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">4</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.24414em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> to <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">V</mi><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">e</mi><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">c</mi><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathsf{Vect}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.69444em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathsf" style="margin-right:0.01389em;">V</span><span class="mord mathsf">e</span><span class="mord mathsf">c</span><span class="mord mathsf">t</span></span></span></span></span> and the morphisms are natural transformations between these functors.

So, we can grab notions from quiver representation theory and use them to gain understanding about imaging systems. For example, this theory describes the kernel and cokernel of a map between quiver representations. These might be useful in describing how an ideal imaging pipeline relates to an non-ideal one: we can capture this difference in the kernel or cokernel of a map between the ideal and non-ideal pipelines. For example, I'm wondering if we can detect the "resolution" of a pipeline in terms of the kernel of a map from an ideal imaging pipeline to the pipeline in question.</p>

<p>I hadn't expected that your idea of imaging systems would be so <em>linear</em> - I can easily imagine a lot of 'image enhancement' algorithms that are nonlinear - but if linear systems are interesting to you, that's very good, because linearity makes things easier.  </p>

<p>In the context of ultrasound imaging, with which I am most familiar, I suspect that the future lies with nonlinear reconstruction and processing - maybe using thing like neural nets. However, in this setting, a <em>lot</em> of imaging schemes can be modeled as being linear. For example, state-of-the-art methods (e.g. "plane wave compounding") for ultrasound imaging with extremely fast frame rates can be modelled as being linear (with the exception of some final "cleaning up" non-linear processing). </p>
<p>There is a huge number of degrees of freedom in the design of an ultrasound imaging system even while staying within the realm of linearity. This is because you have over 100 little vibrating elements that can (nowadays) be controlled individually over time. Necessarily engineers have only implemented a small fraction of the possible schemes. Developing a theory that helps suggest interesting things to try or helps explain why different schemes work (even in just a linear setting) sounds really interesting to me.</p>

<p>Yes, this is very much something I want to do, as this will create a setting where we can compare imaging systems with different numbers of steps. However, I'm trying to get a feel for what I can learn in a setting with fixed pipeline-lengths first.</p>

<p>Yes, this at least gives what I want in the case of morphisms between two pipelines of the same shape that compare each part of the two pipelines part-by-part. (In that case, we can set G = id, and then a morphism is simply a natural transformation from F to F', as desired). I'll have to try it out with some maps between differently shaped pipelines to see if this gives what I want in those cases.</p>

<p>I hope it does good things!   It's a natural construction in category theory (something like a lax slice category or oplax slice category), so there should be a whole pile of theorems that apply to it, but I won't bother thinking about those unless it seems worthwhile.</p>

<p>You shouldn't need to think about 2-categories to understand how to compose natural transformations works: it's easy to figure it out for yourself. In this situation, there are two concepts that are necessary: (left) whiskering, and vertical composition.<br>
I think it helps to draw the diagram like this:<br>

<p>This gives you the natural transformation you seek!   To check that it's really a natural transformation, the more abstract approach provided by Nathanael is best.  You can also just grunge it out.  Or you can just believe me: we get a natural transformation</p>

<p>Thanks to both of you! I was able to figure out the answer from Nathanael Arkor's diagrams, and was pleased to see that the answer I got matched what John Baez described.</p>
<p>Now we can combine "analogies" between imaging systems, even between imaging systems having different shapes (e.g. having a different number of processing steps in a pipeline)! That is, if we can capture part of the structure of imaging system A in the context of system B, and we can capture part of the structure of imaging system B in C,  then we automatically can capture part of the structure of system A in system C.</p>
