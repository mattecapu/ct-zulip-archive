<p>If you want to do work on higher gauge theory using just 2-categories, you can try to apply higher gauge theory to condensed matter physics.  That's a fairly active subject now.  People would like to find actual materials described by 2-group gauge theories.</p>

<p>Thank you very much Sir for the reply. My Background in Physics is very poor.(Almost zero). But still I am very much enthusiastic about  learning how to apply 2-group gauge theory in condensed matter physics.  Though I do not know How and Where tho begin with!!  <br>
   Sir , I have seen in your paper <em>An invitation to higher gauge theory</em> you mentioned that  there is some relation between Higher Gauge theory(Higher Parallel Transports) and Quantum Gravity. So it would be really great  if you kindly suggest  some literatures on both <strong>connection between condensed matter physics and 2-group Gauge theories</strong> and <strong>connection between Higher Gauge theory  and Quantum Gravity</strong>. I am highly interested in understanding and later working on both the topics.</p>

<p>I think research in quantum gravity is doing very poorly right now, and throwing more mathematics at it will not help much: we need people to think hard about the underlying physics.  So, I don't really want to help any young people work on quantum gravity.  But I encourage you to learn general relativity and quantum field theory, since not only are these prerequisites for work on quantum gravity, more importantly they are <em>theories that make verified predictions about our world</em> - so by learning them, you're learning real physics.</p>
<p>Condensed matter physics is doing much better these days, so it's possible for someone who knows a lot of math and a little physics to make a useful contribution.</p>
<p>I don't know the best literature on 2-group gauge theories in condensed matter physics, so these are just some random selections:</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="318500">@ADITTYA CHAUDHURI</span>  There is a TON of higher gauge theory being done in condensed matter at the moment. I noticed <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span> already mentioned several authors such as Apoorv Tiwari. There are also papers by Ryan Thorngren, Anton Kapustin, and Sergei Gukov for example. You might also want to take a look at some of Dan Freed and Greg Moore's work in condensed matter (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.5055">https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.5055</a> is quite influential, and even understanding the appendix will get you very far into the mathematical aspects of topological condensed matter theory). These are more mathematically-minded writers. From a high energy physicist's perspective, check out <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.5148.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.5148.pdf</a> and people who cite this work. For more condensed matter focus, I'd say it's paramount you learn the Levin--Wen model pretty well (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0404617">https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0404617</a>), which is a foundational paper in topological condensed matter. The old papers of Kohmoto (<a href="http://physics.gu.se/~tfkhj/Kohmoto.pdf">http://physics.gu.se/~tfkhj/Kohmoto.pdf</a>) and and TKNN <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.49.405">https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.49.405</a>. I also think it's important to have a solid foundation of the ordinary gauge theoretic aspects of condensed matter before trying to go for the "higher" gauge theoretic aspects. For example, the Berry phase is nothing but the holonomy along a subbundle of a trivial bundle, which is then equipped with the induced connection via projections. If any of those words seem unfamiliar, it's probably important to learn those as well (check out Barry Simon's paper on the subject). There's so much out there, I hope it's not overwhelming. (I actually also have two papers on the subject if you want to check them out btw. they're more on the introductory and mathematical side though...)</p>

<p>Thanks, Arthur.  I haven't been following the literature so my recommendations were nearly random.  I sometimes feel like getting back into higher gauge theory, with much more of a focus on condensed matter physics, but I don't know enough to have any idea of what I would <em>do</em>.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span> Unfortunately, I stopped working in this area, too, but I think I'll find out more in August since I will be attending a conference to check out the current status. Though I could also probably ask Apoorv or Ryan... From what I remember, our understanding of quantum field theory, and the notion of symmetry, seems to be changing quite a lot (even standard things like Noether's theorem---see the first few minutes of Zohar Komargodski's talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkMkCKb1nTw&amp;list=PLx5f8IelFRgGfQMuGGOuqHtRaelyJFj0u&amp;index=14&amp;t=0s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkMkCKb1nTw&amp;list=PLx5f8IelFRgGfQMuGGOuqHtRaelyJFj0u&amp;index=14&amp;t=0s</a>). There are many kinds of "higher-dimensional" operators, generalizing things like Wilson loop operators (such as t'Hooft operators), and I don't think they're all fully understood yet.

<p><span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="318500">ADITTYA CHAUDHURI</span>  There is a TON of higher gauge theory being done in condensed matter at the moment. I noticed <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="275920">John Baez</span> already mentioned several authors such as Apoorv Tiwari. There are also papers by Ryan Thorngren, Anton Kapustin, and Sergei Gukov for example. You might also want to take a look at some of Dan Freed and Greg Moore's work in condensed matter (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.5055">https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.5055</a> is quite influential, and even understanding the appendix will get you very far into the mathematical aspects of topological condensed matter theory). These are more mathematically-minded writers. From a high energy physicist's perspective, check out <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.5148.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.5148.pdf</a> and people who cite this work. For more condensed matter focus, I'd say it's paramount you learn the Levin--Wen model pretty well (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0404617">https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0404617</a>), which is a foundational paper in topological condensed matter. The old papers of Kohmoto (<a href="http://physics.gu.se/~tfkhj/Kohmoto.pdf">http://physics.gu.se/~tfkhj/Kohmoto.pdf</a>) and and TKNN <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.49.405">https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.49.405</a>. I also think it's important to have a solid foundation of the ordinary gauge theoretic aspects of condensed matter before trying to go for the "higher" gauge theoretic aspects. For example, the Berry phase is nothing but the holonomy along a subbundle of a trivial bundle, which is then equipped with the induced connection via projections. If any of those words seem unfamiliar, it's probably important to learn those as well (check out Barry Simon's paper on the subject). There's so much out there, I hope it's not overwhelming. (I actually also have two papers on the subject if you want to check them out btw. they're more on the introductory and mathematical side though...)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank you Sir very much for the references and the information about the subject. I felt I have to learn a quite a lot of stuff before contributing something to the field. But it seems the journey will be exciting. I am also excited to know about your two papers on the subject. So can you please share the links of those two?</p>

<p>Sure, they are <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01139">https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01139</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.6938">https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.6938</a>.

I should also mention Saikat Chatterjee and Amitabha Lahiri, who are both currently in India.

<p>You mean Mathai?  Yeah, if I wanted to work on the quantum Hall effect I'd ask him, but I don't feel any special competence in that area.  I think I might still be better at higher gauge theory than most condensed matter physicists.</p>

<p>Perhaps I'm wrong, but I was under the impression that this (higher categories in theoretical physics) was a much bigger field than the whole of ACT (and possibly that most people doing it don't know or care what ACT is because they already have their own identity, same as applied categories in computer science)</p>

<p>I think Nikolaus and Waldorf have an answer in this 2013 paper:</p>
<p><a href="https://msp.org/pjm/2013/264-2/p04.xhtml">Four equivalent versions of nonabelian gerbes</a><br>
Thomas Nikolaus and Konrad Waldorf<br>
<em>Pacific J. Math.</em> Vol. 264 (2013), No. 2, 355–420</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Abstract:<br>
We recall and partially improve four versions of smooth, nonabelian gerbes: Čech cocycles, classifying maps, bundle gerbes, and principal 2-bundles. We prove that all four versions are equivalent, and so establish new relations between interesting recent developments. Prominent partial results that we prove are a bijection between the continuous and smooth nonabelian cohomology, and an explicit equivalence between bundle gerbes and principal 2-bundles as 2-stacks.</p>

<p>I am just a beginner in the subject so I might be wrong  but it seems to me that they only considered Strict Lie 2 groups in the above paper. Am I making mistakes or interpreting in a wrong way? <a href="/user_uploads/21317/i3JegfaSjGmaEvIx5ZpZ6e-J/ttttttt.png">ttttttt.png</a></p>

<p>This doesn't fully answer your question, but Baez and Lauda in their 2-groups paper show that weak 2-groups are equivalent to coherent ones (in Section 5) and coherent ones are equivalent to special ones (Section 8.3), so at the very least there may be a way of carrying the extra data given by the cohomology class (though I'm not sure how to do this). But if you wanted a cocycle description of such weak 2-group 2-bundles, I would naively think you can use the same idea in Section 3.2 <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.6938.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.6938.pdf</a> (which I originally learned about from Christoph Wockel's work <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0803.3692">https://arxiv.org/abs/0803.3692</a>) by replacing the target category by a weak 2-group and use the definition of a weak 2-functor of 2-categories to define the local cocycle data. I'm not sure if this has been done (it's possible that this has been addressed in the <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\infty</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord">∞</span></span></span></span>-category language, but I can't follow that work).</p>

<p>If you want to use just 2-groups in gauge theory, the most exciting area of study right now is probably applying them to condensed matter physics.</p>

<p>I listed 3 references earlier in this discussion, and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="296639">@Arthur Parzygnat</span> listed more.  I'm not really paying much attention to this subject.    I think Arthur been paying attention more recently.  Here's what he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a TON of higher gauge theory being done in condensed matter at the moment. I noticed <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="275920">John Baez</span> already mentioned several authors such as Apoorv Tiwari. There are also papers by Ryan Thorngren, Anton Kapustin, and Sergei Gukov for example. You might also want to take a look at some of Dan Freed and Greg Moore's work in condensed matter (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.5055">https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.5055</a> is quite influential, and even understanding the appendix will get you very far into the mathematical aspects of topological condensed matter theory). These are more mathematically-minded writers. From a high energy physicist's perspective, check out <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.5148.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.5148.pdf</a> and people who cite this work. For more condensed matter focus, I'd say it's paramount you learn the Levin--Wen model pretty well (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0404617">https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0404617</a>), which is a foundational paper in topological condensed matter. The old papers of Kohmoto (<a href="http://physics.gu.se/~tfkhj/Kohmoto.pdf">http://physics.gu.se/~tfkhj/Kohmoto.pdf</a>) and and TKNN <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.49.405">https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.49.405</a>. I also think it's important to have a solid foundation of the ordinary gauge theoretic aspects of condensed matter before trying to go for the "higher" gauge theoretic aspects. For example, the Berry phase is nothing but the holonomy along a subbundle of a trivial bundle, which is then equipped with the induced connection via projections. If any of those words seem unfamiliar, it's probably important to learn those as well (check out Barry Simon's paper on the subject). There's so much out there, I hope it's not overwhelming. (I actually also have two papers on the subject if you want to check them out btw. they're more on the introductory and mathematical side though...)</p>

<p>As for the specific question if I know there is published work on it, no, I'm not sure. But that's not because it doesn't exist, more so because I was never curious.

As for applications of higher gauge theory, I see two directions. On the one hand you have string theory and M-theory. On the other hand, you have condensed matter physics and low-energy field theories, which can have extended object excitations.

<p>If you want my personal opinion, I would recommend you work on what interests you the most, and at the same time something you think might be a useful contribution.

<p>I would say if you're merely interested in the purely mathematical aspects, there are many interesting things one can do without knowing any QFT whatsoever. But as far as I am aware, the main point of higher gauge theory was to provide a formulation for the gauge theory for extended objects, and in both of the examples I am aware of where such objects occur, knowledge of QFT seems to be needed. That's not to say it has no applicability outside these two areas, I just don't know about them (actually, there has also been some work in teleparallel gravity <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1204.4339">https://arxiv.org/abs/1204.4339</a>, which only requires some knowledge of GR, but I don't know how far this has gone). </p>
<p>Outside of physics, one can also view higher bundles as additional structures one can place on manifolds. Is there a K-theory associated with them? Do they have a sensible theory of characteristic classes? Are there differential refinements? I don't know if there are answers to any of these questions (other than the theory of Dixmier--Douady classes), though I suspect Schreiber and others work is exactly meant to address at least some of them.</p>
