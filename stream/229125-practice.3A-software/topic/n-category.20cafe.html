<p>This site looks like it has great content but the web design is kind of old school. <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/">https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/</a> Does anyone want to build a new front end for it? I also didn’t see an ability to email subscribe, only RSS. Would be interested to try to recreate the site as is but just slightly more modern.</p>

<p>This site was set up by <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/">Jacques Distler</a> and it was really cool when it first appeared, because there weren't many blogs that did LaTeX - and there still aren't many that do it so nicely.   But I'm very worried about what will happen when he dies, because it's on a server he runs, and I don't know if anyone has access to the back end, and knows how the software works, except him!</p>

<p>Whatever format the comtributors would like, within reason, I’m fine with.  </p>
<p>Is there code on the nCafe?  I love notebooks but generally think of Jupyter as being for code you actually want to run intermixed with graphs and LaTeX or text.  Otherwise it’s a lot of overhead.</p>
<p>I think maybe markdown with a KaTeX plugin (like <a href="https://github.com/zulip">Zulip</a> is probably the most minimal we could go and still have nice easy display options.  There will be lots of libraries that can handle that.</p>
<p>The interlinking of comments etc is more what I’m worried about translating, if we had to translate into something with more forward support.  The context there of who is replying to whom about what is often critical for understanding.</p>

<p>the source of each post, including comments, is really nicely structured html, so it would be "trivial" to port over everything to pretty much any static site generator if the need ever arises in the future. if somebody with access sets up a backup (with moderators' permissions, it would be nice to maybe automatically mirror these to a github repo)</p>

<p>Thanks!  So far we've been putting off doing anything, because it's a bit of a touchy subject ("Hey, we'd like to make sure your blog keeps working when you die") and also none of the people blogging on the n-Category Cafe has any special interest in, or knowledge of, the software challenges needed to solve the problem.  </p>
<p>So for now  you could help just by talking about this stuff... as you are now:</p>

<p>I think what we'd <em>really</em> like is to give the blog a longer life, moving the old content to a new platform that will be just as good as the existing one but not rely on the expertise of one particular person to survive, while also allowing new blog articles.   This goes beyond merely "archiving" it as in (1) and (2).</p>
<p>However, archiving the old stuff would still be of value, if for some reason the ideal is too hard.</p>

<p>Okay, excellent!   If this is a "trivial" way to back up the n-Cafe - i.e., not too much work for people who actually know what they're doing - I guess it's worth doing.  It doesn't solve the harder problem of moving the blog to a better long-term location, and it doesn't preserve the source data used to generate the html.   But it's something.</p>

<p>Thanks!  So far we've been putting off doing anything, because it's a bit of a touchy subject ("Hey, we'd like to make sure your blog keeps working when you die")<br>
...<br>
I think what we'd <em>really</em> like is to give the blog a longer life, moving the old content to a new platform that will be just as good as the existing one but not rely on the expertise of one particular person to survive, while also allowing new blog articles.</p>

<p>100%. </p>
<p>I hope he is well of course, but if you know otherwise, that could be a welcome and very soulful conversation for him.  A kind of baton-passing and an opportunity for him to state any unrealized aspirations he had for the n-Cafe.  It's meaningful to everyone to see things they valued carry on.</p>
<p>So we can put together technical options for now, and once there is something like consensus, perhaps it will be easier to propose something to Jacques.</p>

<p>As the contributors are happy with the existing interface, probably the most conservative thing to do, would be to price out and experiment with movable type running inside docker on an EC2 / gcloud instance not hosted at U-Texas (movable type is what n-Cafe currently uses).  This doesn't look to be too hard: <a href="https://movabletype.org/start/">https://movabletype.org/start/</a>.</p>
<p>So how about this as a survival plan:</p>
<ol>
<li>setup a backup strategy more robust and alertful than "cronjob wget on Tim's desktop". :)</li>
<li>run an experiment restoring to a live blog from said backup</li>
<li>document what needed to be done, and how to check if everything is working, ideally dummy proof everything into a docker script</li>
<li>Periodically check everything still works and is being backed up.</li>
</ol>
<p>At that point, there would seem to be nothing further to do and we can all move on to getting distracted by something else. :)</p>

<p>yeah, I tried this, but because I don't have a complete list of the domains on which all the images are found (because they're very scattered), I can't use this flag, which means it tries to get <em>everything</em> that's linked — I ran the command overnight and woke up to over 2500 folders from different domains <span aria-label="upside down" class="emoji emoji-1f643" role="img" title="upside down">:upside_down:</span></p>

<p>So the idea is that a new version of the blog would only get activated when the old one died, or was about to die - and all the old articles would get copied to the new one?</p>
<p>It might actually be easier to transfer to a new version 'now', while the old one is still running and Jacques is still peppy</p>

<p>Ok! </p>
<p>(It will still be <em>frustrating</em> to be clear; I reserve the right to curse at my screen for instance… Nothing with computers is ever as easy as it should be. :)</p>
<p>I’ll look into setting up a dockerized movable type instance and whether that does indeed look simple and affordable and reproducible I’ll report back here.  I might not actually get to this until late August due to family stuff — I assume there is no pressing deadline; if others want to get started experimenting, by all means, please do.</p>
<p>So once I make a “do-ability” report y’all can make the call about how Jacques should be contacted, and fill in the rest of the strategy.</p>

<p>Some version of Crowdstrike security software is available for windows, MacOS, UNIX, and linux.</p>
<p>On windows the Crowdstrike code must run at a very low level, as in it breaks a lot of abstractions that other programs respect.  (It is also designed to do a lot more, perhaps so big companies can hire cheaper sysadmins…)</p>
<p>macOS, UNIX, and (much) Linux architecture have different security models.  For example on Macs, the Crowdstrike updates are loaded first in a user space.  So if something goes wrong, the problem is much more likely <em>recoverable</em> because the lowest level of the OS kernel is not (yet) affected.</p>
<p>Why doesn’t windows do the same?  My understanding is that it’s not possible — there’s not enough designed separation between core functions managed by root/admin and those of the user at a low level — instead these ideas were added <em>after</em>.  (The code base of windows is also literally orders of magnitude larger in lines of code so harder to manage, update, understand… there’s a reason something like 85% of internet servers run some variety of unix)</p>
<p>So, when you have third party code affecting your kernel, and auto-updating daily, and running at the lowest level it possibly can… you get exactly this kind of issue. :(</p>
<p>Now Red Hat Enterprise and Ubuntu have been moving in the direction of windows, and Crowdstrike did cause kernel panics on Red Hat Enterprise a few years back. So even if you start from a better designed security model, it’s still possible to screw things up!  I’m not making some kind of “inherent superiority” argument.</p>
<p>Crowdstrike is the proximate cause of this meltdown.  Poor security models and bloatware are IMO the fundamental causes.  You could say for historical reasons Windows is much more strongly affected by these problems than *nix systems.</p>

<p>But in a sense I do agree with you.  The “endpoint protection” Crowdstrike sells is just the same idea as Norton Antivirus etc. — third party rootkits — on steroids and repackaged as a solution to sell to people with big wallets and no interest/understanding in security, but a need to CYA and check boxes.  Crowdstrike is crap!  Ok I’ll stop my ranting now. :)</p>

<p>Does anyone else have technical issues with the n-Category Café again? I've tried to add a comment to the post <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2024/08/introduction_to_categorical_pr.html">Introduction to Categorical Probability</a>, and there are two things that go wrong:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Upon clicking on "Preview", my browser (Vivaldi, a fork of Chromium) replaces the text in the comment box by this:<br>
<a href="/user_uploads/21317/sS2ai-RJ32y65hLvZLDi6usO/image.png">image.png</a><br>
Nevertheless, the preview displays correctly.</p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/21317/sS2ai-RJ32y65hLvZLDi6usO/image.png" title="image.png"><img data-original-dimensions="1077x630" src="/user_uploads/thumbnail/21317/sS2ai-RJ32y65hLvZLDi6usO/image.png/840x560.webp"></a></div></li>
<li>
<p>In order to allow me to post, I need to paste the same text again into the comment box, since otherwise the system complains about me having "edited" my comment due to the previous issue. After pasting the text again, the webpage of the post with the discussion below appears as it usually does, but my comment is still missing. I've just tried this twice and it doesn't appear.</p>

<p>I have had the problem Tobias is having for ages now. I copy the text of the comment before hitting preview, and then once the preview is shown, paste in the text again and hit submit, and it works ok 99% of the time. I'm using Firefox, with uBlock origin installed and a few other extensions. I'll have to experiment to see which if any of these are causing trouble.</p>

<p>The only problem is if the comment processing modifies the raw text input, and then the pasted text in the box somehow mismatches the "cleaned" input (at least this is my guess as to what is happening).</p>
