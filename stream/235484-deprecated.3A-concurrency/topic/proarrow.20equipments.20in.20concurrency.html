<p>Hi everyone.  I'd like to share an idea I've been excited about recently.</p>
<p>The idea is that single object proarrow equipments (from the double categorical perspective) are an algebra of 'concurrent resource transformations' in the same way that monoidal categories are an algebra of 'resource transformations'. </p>
<p>I've written a short (not very technical) paper explaining how this is so. Its been rejected from one conference, and I'm going to submit an ever shorter version to another, but I have a feeling that the idea is going to wind up as a small part of a larger paper, instead of being presented on its own. </p>
<p>I think some of you might be interested, so I'll link the preprint of the short paper here: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08233">https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08233</a></p>
<p>(I know its got a few typos in. I've fixed them locally, but won't update the arxiv version just yet).</p>

<p>Cool! It seems to me like you are using double categories to represent concurrency with multiple agents, where the corners represent passing or receiving a resource from another agent. Is this how you think of it <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276114">@Chad Nester</span></p>

<p>I'm not necessarily thinking of each cell as an "agent" (I don't really know what that means, so I could be wrong here), but I think that what distinguishes a concurrent system from, say, one in which processes unfold in parallel, is that the material histories of its components are interleaved.</p>

<p>For example, it would be nice if we could write down biological processes in some calculus, and then have them generate 'resource transformations' explaining, say, how the biomolecules involved have changed (the "material history" part) as they unfold. I think we need both perspectives (process calculus + material effects) to get a satisfying account.</p>

<p>Me, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="282822">@fosco</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="281862">@Daniele Palombi</span> have another perspective on this, coming from the work of Rosen, and this is what we based the ManaNets paper on. Biological processes are a bunch of chemical reactions such that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some reactions require some metabolytes to happen</li>
<li>These metabolytes degrade over time</li>
<li>These metabolytes are produced by other reactions in the process, so that the system kinda self-sustains.</li>

<p>In any case, back to the original issue: I am not a fan of describing concurrent processes in terms of messages. There are very deep reasons for this, but in a nutshell: A concurrent system is made of two layers:</p>
<ul>
<li>A network layer, where messages get exchanged. The network can also dynamically change in time, and you should also take into account things like latencies etc to model race conditions.</li>
<li>A local layer, that is, the computation that each machine executes locally.<br>
All the frameworks I've seen so far either ignore the network layer (e.g. lambda calculus, FSMs) or ignore the local layer (e.g. pi calculus, Petri nets). We won't go anywhere until we merge the two approaches into a unique condition. I've tried to do so using sheaves for two years and with the help of many people (lately mainly <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275932">@Matteo Capucci (he/him)</span> ), but it's effing hard, and I'm not anymore convinced that sheaves are the right way to tackle this. If someone is interested in pursuing this line of research, or to suggest any possible mathematical tool to model this, please let me know, I'm -&gt;Super&lt;- interested in this.</li>

<p>When you try to get deeper into this you realize that this problem is "slimy". Everywhere you turn there's something that evades you, or that you aren't modelling.. In the end, it's very difficult to come up with a model that formalizes this correctly while being manageable enough to crunch some numbers.</p>

<p>In this respect, I agree that you could see this as a bunch of process calculi happening locally, and coordinated by a network layer. Still, very difficult to properly frame it</p>

<p>In any case, back to the original issue: I am not a fan of describing concurrent processes in terms of messages. There are very deep reasons for this, but in a nutshell: A concurrent system is made of two layers:</p>
<ul>
<li>A network layer, where messages get exchanged. The network can also dynamically change in time, and you should also take into account things like latencies etc to model race conditions.</li>
<li>A local layer, that is, the computation that each machine executes locally.<br>
All the frameworks I've seen so far either ignore the network layer (e.g. lambda calculus, FSMs) or ignore the local layer (e.g. pi calculus, Petri nets). We won't go anywhere until we merge the two approaches into a unique condition. I've tried to do so using sheaves for two years and with the help of many people (lately mainly <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="275932">Matteo Capucci (he/him)</span> ), but it's effing hard, and I'm not anymore convinced that sheaves are the right way to tackle this. If someone is interested in pursuing this line of research, or to suggest any possible mathematical tool to model this, please let me know, I'm -&gt;Super&lt;- interested in this.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I suppose that I don't entirely understand this distinction. I would say that Petri nets can do both, either model the computations on a specific machine or model the coordination between machines. Similarly, FSM's can also model on both levels. Is your point that they don't model at both levels at the same time? If so there are various ways to make Petri nets Hierarchical which I think you might already be aware of... .</p>

<p>In some sense open Petri nets can model this type of hierarchy, each open Petri net can represent an individual machine which can be joined along various message passing channels to form the larger system. There are also elementary object systems which I am personally a fan of.</p>

<p>My interest in Rosen's work can be summarised in the fact that some of the properties of living systems that Rosen tried to express in categorical language can indeed be expressed as such, just relying not on 1-categories, but on 2- or bi-categories. (This is where some form of proarrow-equipmentish-calculus could turn out to be useful)</p>
<p>It was an intuition of Cǎzǎnescu and Baianu that a category of (M,R)-systems can be expressed as a category of automata in a cartesian closed category. I suspect one can extract a more faithful description of (M,R)-systems by performing the same categorical construction of Cǎzǎnescu-Baianu but in a linearly distributive category. After all, chemical reactions are linear. (I found there's already a very enticing paper on a "<span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>λ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\lambda</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.69444em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">λ</span></span></span></span>-calculus for chemical reactions", weeks ago, but in the end I didn't enter the white rabbit hole).</p>

<p>Maybe? Our commercial offering does analysis against these graphs, things like satisfiability  &amp;c, and depending on which form the particular analysis at hand needs, we build one graph type or the other. This seems fine from an engineering standpoint because we're going to optimize the structure of the data as needed anyway, but in terms of having a cohesive way to express to a user what her system did, I'd say that'd be <em>very</em> interesting. I probably can't hang with most of the CT in this paper, but I'm going to give it a read anyway, for sure—if only to see what intuitions shake out.</p>

<p>Petri nets can represent concurrency well, but they are nowhere close to representing what I'm talking about. Few reasons for this:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can use Petri nets to represent local, multi-threaded computation. This works reasonably well.</li>
<li>You can use Petri nets to represent information flow in a network. This works really not well, mainly because the network varies dynamically, and also because to be of any practical use you cannot model message passing as a point-to-point event. Messages on real network get broadcasted, that is, send to many machines at the same time. Representing this by adding a lot of transitions around that copy resources is not going to fly.</li>
<li>Representing both things at the same time requires some level of hiearchy, but in this framework you want the places of a net to be Petri nets themselves. This is not exactly what the literature has been doing so far.</li>

<p>By the way, my sheaf-theoretic approach to this problem (that went nowhere) was mainly motivated by point 2 above: Nearly all examples of connectivity/compositionality in ACT are point to point. This includes open petri nets, wiring diagrams, string diagrams, quantum stuff. I don't think this approach is really insightful in describing big networks of computers and P2P protocols, that work on completely different assumptions.</p>

<p>For instance, if I request a file in a P2P network I'm sending a message around saying "hey, who has this file?" Every machine having it will maybe reply to me. Others will just discard the message. The message is broadcasted around until the network is saturated. In this case describing things as a sequence of point-to-point communication just makes things murky.</p>

<p>There are a ton of protocols - heavily used ones - that work this way (parse what matters to you, discard the rest), e.g. MQTT or the CAN bus. These are easier to describe because they are not decentralized.</p>

<p>What I'm saying is that from an engineering perspective the idea of compositionality as "the act of composing two systems" won't fly if the system described is really big. I was thinking about writing a non-technical paper about this for the next ACT, and submitting it as non-proceeding. "compositionality for big systems" is definitely something we will have to think about a few years from now <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span></p>

<p>A thought I had somewhen last week, since we often spoke about sheaves in this context. Sheaves might not be the right tools for this job, at least not naively, because sheaves talk about <em>local</em> things. As soon as you want to be able to talk about non-local phenomena (see mana nets) you gotta abandon the sheaf condition.<br>
Implicitly, I also realized this when I gave <a href="https://github.com/mattecapu/fantastic-sheaves">my talk about sheaves</a> and I described cohomology of behaviour as the cohomology of the <em>augmented</em> Cech complex. In layman terms, this means not taking separation and glueing for granted by measuring their failures as well.</p>

<p>I've managed to convince myself that the "left and right" thing is pretty natural. I think you're talking about what I would call the 'vertical monoid' (occupying the left and right boundaries), in which case the noncommutativity comes from not being able to give something away before you have it (in general, anyway).</p>

<p>More visually, the noncommutativity comes from being able to bend wires 'down', but not 'up'. Since we're thinking of events as unfolding from top to bottom, this is like insisting that we must have a thing in order to use it.</p>

<p>"Concurrency" is a pretty overloaded term, but in programming it usually means local computation, and what you get by adding various network effects (dynamic topology, partitions, crashes/byzantine behaviour etc) is usually grouped under the term "distributed systems". The border between the two is of course pretty fuzzy because of stuff like weak memory models, where each CPU core and its cache is essentially a separate agent which must negotiate with others, which sometimes introduces some bizzare side-effects in the execution.</p>

<p>I suppose that I don't entirely understand this distinction. I would say that Petri nets can do both, either model the computations on a specific machine or model the coordination between machines. Similarly, FSM's can also model on both levels. Is your point that they don't model at both levels at the same time? If so there are various ways to make Petri nets Hierarchical which I think you might already be aware of... .</p>

What I mean is that networks and local computations, in my opinion, are conceptually very different. Networks are best explained using messages, local computations using stuff like lambda calculus. All the models I've seen so far throw everything in the same bucket: pi calculus describes everything in terms of messages for instance, which makes it cumbersome to do some of the things that lambda calculus does easily. lambda calculus does not have a notion of message or channel, and so network models become difficult to express in that framework. All these models are pretty extreme, meaning that you are looking at everything using the same conceptual filter.</p>

<p>In ordinary infrastructure we have a network layer and a local layer. These are both ultimately the same if you describe them as "electrons going around" but really have much much different conceptual flavors, and all the models I've seen so far discard one of these flavors to favor the other. I don't think this makes real justice to the task of describing what things like consensus protocols are</p>

<p>Maybe, to clarify, try to invert things: As (I think) Samson Abramsky once asked, "which function does the Internet compute?"<br>
Theoretically, you _could_ come up with something a program for a Turing machine that computes the internet. You can for sure because of Turing completeness. We all know that this approach won't fly tho. <br>
I think pi calculus didn't really become popular among programmers for a similar reason: It is great to model messaging infrastructure, but it is incredibly cumbersome for modelling task that are menial in other languages. All in all I think all these paradigms fall short of something when you employ them to model mixed systems where local computations, messaging and (maybe) data storage/retrieve are all happening at the same time.</p>

<p>In any case, back to the original issue: I am not a fan of describing concurrent processes in terms of messages. There are very deep reasons for this, but in a nutshell: A concurrent system is made of two layers:</p>
<ul>
<li>A network layer, where messages get exchanged. The network can also dynamically change in time, and you should also take into account things like latencies etc to model race conditions.</li>
<li>A local layer, that is, the computation that each machine executes locally.<br>
All the frameworks I've seen so far either ignore the network layer (e.g. lambda calculus, FSMs) or ignore the local layer (e.g. pi calculus, Petri nets). We won't go anywhere until we merge the two approaches into a unique condition. I've tried to do so using sheaves for two years and with the help of many people (lately mainly <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="275932">Matteo Capucci (he/him)</span> ), but it's effing hard, and I'm not anymore convinced that sheaves are the right way to tackle this.

<p>So, my main idea/hope was this: Sheaves are a way to globally organize a bunch of local information. Here, if I take "local information" to be what happens on a single machine, the it should be possible to express this local vs global thing using the language of sheaves. One would organize a bunch of machines into a (pre)sheaf, which would represent the act of consistently organizing those machines (by sharing messages and resources). We tried to investigate this point of view for quite a while but got absolutely nothing out of it, so I am afraid I cannot be more precise as of now...</p>

<p>My understanding of the terminological situation is that "proarrow equipment", "connection structure",  "companion and conjoint structure", and "framed bicategory" can all be construed to mean the same thing (I would love to be corrected). This thing is the same as having "corners", which I personally find to be much saner terminology in light of the string diagrams.</p>

<p>I expect that "has crossing cells" is nearly the same thing as "is a monoidal double category" in the single-object case, so you can probably get rid of the assumption of symmetry and just ask for it to be a monoidal double category directly.</p>

We planned to submit to CALCO so we formalized things using different stuff and the deadline is too soon to change things now, but I'd be happy to see if with your work things can be made better. Maybe we can talk as soon as this hellish deadline season ends?</p>

<p>I'd also read the first version and enjoyed it. The connection with transition systems in this one seems like a nice addition!  In particular it seems to give another really nice motivation for the distinction between the horizontal and vertical axes (which was the key conceptual contribution of the first version, if I understood correctly).</p>

<p>Cool! I suppose what I focused on in my thesis was a rather restricted subcategory of Span(Graph). I only skimmed the new version of your paper but could some of your situated transition systems be described concisely by Petri nets with boundaries or, conversely, couldn't Petri nets with boundaries be seen as generating free cornerings? This might provide a nice point of contact between the work on Petri nets as generators of free SMCs and the work on Petri nets with boundaries.</p>

<p>I confess to knowing essentially nothing about Petri nets. My understanding is that a Petri net is essentially a monoidal signature, with the places giving the atomic objects and the transitions giving the generating morphisms. Then the associated symmetric monoidal category is called the category of "executions" of the Petri net. I had a look at the decorated cospans version of open Petri nets, thinking it might be an instance of the corner structure, but as far as I can tell this isn't the case. Is there a different version of Petri nets with boundaries? </p>
<p>A related question, open to anyone reading this: I'm under the impression that people don't usually impose equations on the monoidal signature associated with a Petri net. From the resource theory view of monoidal signatures this is extremely natural, which seems like an advantage. Am I wrong?</p>

<p>This is very hand-wavy said this way, but if you wish this is a "synchronous" gluing, meaning that if a transition fires, the transition it is glued with has to fire as well. This definition is way more manageable in terms of studying the reachability relation of a net from its components, whereas gluing on places, albeit more intuitive, is problematic because it is asynchronous: When you put a token in a place, you never know which transition will use it, and when</p>

<p>Here I don't think I agree, the most important thing of the category of executions of a Petri net is that it is monoidal, and as such you have an interchange law given by the functoriality of the tensor product. This basically models concurrency, that is, the idea that if two boxes (transitions) are causally independent, it doesn't matter which one comes first (which transition fires first)</p>

<p>Do you impose the same equations every time in order to obtain the same categorical structure?

<p>The point is that you do this if you want to use Petri nets to present monoidal category. Traditionally, this is not what Petri nets are made for. You can do it in any case, I just don't think it is too interesting for people studying Petri nets</p>

<p>I had a look at the decorated cospans version of open Petri nets, thinking it might be an instance of the corner structure, but as far as I can tell this isn't the case. Is there a different version of Petri nets with boundaries? </p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276438">@Fabrizio Genovese</span> already answered some of your questions so I'll only try to develop a bit what I hinted at earlier and  answer this question of yours.  My vision may be extremely naive at this point because I've never worked properly on the Petri net-as-SMC view. More knowledgeable people in this area should definitely correct me if they think there's a fundamental obstacle to developing what I had in mind.</p>
<p>If you only care about reachability, you can view a Petri net as just a collection transitions, i.e. of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mi>P</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">|P|</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord">∣</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">P</span><span class="mord">∣</span></span></span></span> dimensional <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="double-struck">Z</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb Z</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68889em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathbb">Z</span></span></span></span>-vectors, where <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>P</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">P</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">P</span></span></span></span> is the set of places Then valid runs are sequences of points in the lattice <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi mathvariant="double-struck">N</mi><mi>P</mi></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb N^P</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8413309999999999em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathbb">N</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.8413309999999999em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mathnormal mtight" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">P</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> such that, starting at any of them one can reach the next adding (i.e. firing) one of the transition to it.  </p>
<p>But if you care about how you get from one state to another, you can also name your transitions and view them as a set of  generators of some SMC. Now instead of points in a <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi><mi>P</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">∣</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">|P|</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord">∣</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">P</span><span class="mord">∣</span></span></span></span>-dimensional lattice, each dimension is a generating object of the corresponding SMC and each transition a generating morphism. Instead of a sequence of points, a run is now a morphism of the free SMC on these generators. From the point of view of reachability, this is the same. But now you're keeping track of much more information in each run, namely how (with what combination of transitions) you transformed some resources (the objects of the category) into others, modulo the laws of SMCs which factor out irrelevant ordering of transitions that can be fired concurrently (this is the interchange law Fabrizio was talking about). </p>
<p>Petri nets with boundaries are Petri nets  with potentially open transitions, which require synchronising with their environment to be fired. In some sense, they are orthogonal to the the Petri-net-as-SMC perspective. Together they form an SMC (this is different form how each standard Petri net can generate an SMC) and their semantics in all previous work I know of has been given in terms of sets and (so called additive) relations. But that's just an extension of the first perspective on Petri nets that I sketched above, to account for open transitions. If we wanted to keep track more precisely of how one gets from one state to another in Petri-net-as-SMC style we would need another dimension and your double-categorical framework seems like a natural candidate. </p>
<p>When I first learnt about Petri nets-as-SMC, I knew about Petri nets with boundaries and wondered what sort of mathematical object these would generate but no real answer. Seeing your work, I conjectured above that cornerings could be it. Maybe cornerings are overkill and a simpler double-categorical structure is sufficient but one should definitely have some sort of correspondence between the objects in the vertical (resource) and horizontal (boundary) dimensions.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276114">@Chad Nester</span> If you want to impose extra equations, of a more ad-hoc sort, on the free smc generated by a Petri net then I think the best way to do that is with semantics. I.e. you can impose equations by taking a symmetric monoidal functor into a category C where the equations you want to hold do hold.</p>

<p>If you don't like "commutative monoidal categories", the same issues show up for symmetric strict monoidal categories: in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04238">our paper</a> we construct an adjunction between symmetric strict monoidal categories and a variant of Petri nets that we call <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="normal">Σ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\Sigma</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord">Σ</span></span></span></span>-nets.</p>

<p>So again it would be nice to know if this adjunction is monadic, because that would instantly give us access to a lot of results about "generators and relations" descriptions of symmetric strict monoidal categories.</p>

<p>I guess while I'm at it, I should advertise that <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="278430">@Brandon Coya</span> and Franciscus Rebro and I came up with a nice monadic adjunction between PROPs and certain "signatures", which allows us to get generators and relations descriptions of PROPs.

<p>In practice people have been describing PROPs using generators and relations since the Late Bronze Age.   But our results justify this and - perhaps more importantly - give access to all sorts of nice results.   For example, if you take a PROP and throw in some extra relations, you get a new PROP and an epimorphism from the original PROP to this new one.      Or, if you thrown in some new generators, you get a new PROP and a <em>monomorphism</em> from the original PROP to the new one.</p>

<p>My conjecture would imply some similar results for Petri nets.</p>

<p>I do prefer the symmetric version of all of this over the commutative one. Still I see why your conjecture is interesting.</p>

<p>... for the time being I personally will  just keep working with arbitrary monoidal categories, often freely generated, but I'd be interested to hear about any developments.</p>

<p>So: it turns out that the category of optics in a monoidal category is a full subcategory of the horizontal cells of the free cornering of that category (the free proarrow equipment constructed from it by adding corners).</p>
