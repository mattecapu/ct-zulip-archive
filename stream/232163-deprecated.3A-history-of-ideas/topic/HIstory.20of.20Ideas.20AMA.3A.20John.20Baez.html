<p>Okay.   I'll say a tiny bit (but then I'll eat dinner).  I started out being obsessed with how we could know anything, so I studied logic in high school and as an undergrad, taking courses with Benacerraf and Kripke.  But I was also obsessed with physics since my uncle (Joan's dad) was a physicist.  So, I did my undergrad thesis on computability in quantum mechanics.   Then I temporarily lost interest in logic.</p>

<p>Yes!   I feel like explaining <em>why</em> I worked on recursivity in quantum mechanics.   When I was taking a course on general relativity I got really excited by John Wheeler's crazy ideas near the end of his ttextbook <em>Gravitation</em>.  One of them was the "participatory universe", the idea that the universe only exists because it has observers in it.  I dreamt of making this precise somehow so I started thinking about how complex a universe had to be to have life in it that was complex enough to understand the laws of that universe   I couldn't get far with that, but in the process I started thinking about whether time evolution in quantum mechanics was computable.  I reinvented a bunch of the theory of computable functions between metric spaces, and when I got a thesis advisor, John Burgess in the philosophy department, he said "oh, you've reinvented a bunch of stuff, read <em>Descriptive Set Theory</em> by Moschovakis and use that."  So I did.</p>

<p>By the time I was done I decided that computability shed no really interesting light on physics.   So I decided to work on another one of Wheeler's dreams: coming up with a theory of quantum gravity!</p>

<p>I went to grad school in the math department at MIT and learned a bunch of math, but when it came to getting an advisor I was frustrated that nobody in the math department was really interested in quantum gravity.   The people I really liked were Dan Quillen, Victor Guillemin and Irving Segal.   My friend Varghese Mathai and I sat in on Quillen's lectures where he was trying to come up with an elementary proof of the Atiyah-Singer index theorem.  Mathai wound up working with Quillen.  I decided that if I were going to work on quantum gravity I should at least learn quantum field theory well, so I decided to work with Segal on that.</p>

<p>Yes, I guess I'd mainly seen Bell's inequality phrased in a rather old-fashioned way and I wanted to make it be about commutative vs. noncommutative C*-algebras.   Segal was very interested in thinking about probability theory algebraically so I probably absorbed that attitude from him.</p>

<p>Right.  I used to know that stuff because Mathai was always explaining it to me when we were students... oh yeah, and Quillen had lectured about it in his course!   Quillen would work out new ideas in a course he always taught, which was always called "Homological Algebra" regardless of what it was about.  He would lecture from an old-fashioned composition notebook.  Each hour the lecture would start out flawlessly, but often at the end he'd reach the material he hadn't quite figured out yet, and sometimes he'd get stuck.  Then the next class he'd go over that material again, having solved whatever problem he'd gotten stuck on.  It was quite inspiring.</p>

<p>By the time I got my PhD I was pretty depressed about my work in math: I hadn't been working on what I really wanted, which was quantum gravity, and my thesis hadn't accomplished very much.  People at MIT and Harvard were getting really interested in supersymmetry and string theory and basically whatever Witten was doing - he'd come up and give talks.  But I didn't believe in string theory so I couldn't work on it.</p>

<p>I was thinking of quitting math and switching to either philosophy or music.  For a couple of years I'd been taking Gian-Carlo Rota's courses on philosophy at MIT.  He's mainly famous for combinatorics but I never took a math course from him - unfortunately.   I had a friend who was really into Heidegger's <em>Being and Time</em>, and when I saw Rota was teaching a course on that I took that.  It was quite exciting.</p>

<p>Rota would lecture from notecards from 7 pm to 10 pm on Thursdays, with a break to smoke in the middle, and he'd go out to dinner with some of the more enthusiastic students afterwards, usually at Legal Seafood.  I was very shy and had few friends back then, but some of my best friends were in this philosophy discussion group.   We started meeting on Fridays at Au Bon Pain in Harvard Square, reading through books by Heidegger out loud... and later dialogues of Plato.   We also sat in on a course taught by Gadamer (a European philosopher).</p>

<p>I did not have too much to do.  I had almost no friends, and I had a fellowship so I didn't need to be a TA, and I spent huge amounts of time in the library reading.  This continued the pattern I started as an undergrad.  So yes, I was thinking about quantum gravity, reading stuff about it.</p>

<p>Anyway, when I told Rota I was thinking of switching to philosophy, he said that was a bad idea.  He said I should get tenure in math and then do philosophy on the side (like he did).   </p>
<p>And that was very good advice.  (I would actually have been very bad as a professional philospher, and quite miserable I think.   It's easier in math to feel like you've actually done something that will remain valuable - not necessarily great, but "true".)</p>

<p>Hmm.  It was the final chapters of <em>Gravitation</em> that inspired me the most.  I found Connes' work on noncommutative geometry very inspiring too.   This was before Connes started working on quantum gravity or particle physics using noncommutative geometry.   I was just fascinated by the idea of redoing differential geometry with a noncommutative algebras.</p>

<p>Okay.   I'll say a tiny bit (but then I'll eat dinner).  I started out being obsessed with how we could know anything, so I studied logic in high school and as an undergrad, taking courses with Benacerraf and Kripke.<br>
But I was also obsessed with physics since my uncle (Joan's dad) was a physicist.  So, I did my undergrad thesis on computability in quantum mechanics.   Then I temporarily lost interest in logic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh, so that's actually really interesting. As I mentioned before I came across Kripke and D.Lewis in the 1980ies and found those really helpful in thinking on all kinds of topics, from philosophy of language, to causation, epistemology, and recently security. With the possible worlds interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, it even seemed to make QM quite intuitive. Looking around I found this 2004 article by Lewis <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/713659799">How many Lives has Schrodinger's Cat?</a> - this must have been published right before his death - and I also found a critique by David Papineau <a href="http://How%20Many%20Lives%20Has%20Schrödinger's%20Cat">David Lewis and Schrodinger's Cat</a>. I can't really go very far in the direction of QM, or I'll never get done what I was trying to do on security. But it would be nice to know if there is a point where in CT modal logic and QM do come together.</p>

<p>I know a lot more about quantum logic than modal logic - back when I was in college I really liked reading about quantum logic.   I didn't study any modal logic with Kripke; I took a course with him on Goedel's completeness theorem where he gave a painstakingly detailed proof.   Amusingly, I remember my parents first taking me to Princeton and sitting in on a lecture by Lewis about possible worlds. My mother had a more romantic notion of philosophy and found it completely bewildering and off-putting.</p>
<p>From my limited knowledge of modal logic, it doesn't seem to have much to say about the truly distinctive features of quantum mechanics.   Probably someone should invent "quantum modal" logic.  Probably someone already has.</p>

<p>Are you more or less clear on the "how we can know" question today? You describe how that made you go to contemporary thinkers, as opposed to the classical Spinoza, Descartes, Kant, etc. Do you think we got closer to that question after the positivists at the turn of the last century?</p>

<p>By now I'm too interested in other things to pay much attention to work on quantum computation or computability in physics, like that paper on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04573">undecidability of the spectral gap</a>,  or <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4512">MIP* = RE</a>.  </p>
<p>I did write a paper on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.2067">algorithmic thermodynamics</a> with Mike Stay, which is based on the fact that you can see Kolmogorov entropy as a special case of ordinary Shannon entropy <em>if</em> you use <em>relative</em> entropy.   I think this idea is interesting but I haven't figured out what else to do with it beyond what's in that paper... and it seems nobody else knows what to make of it either.</p>

<p>I'm gonna have to go shopping now, but I was just about to say something relevant.  I was gripped with nihilistic despair from about 1978 (when I graduated from high school) to about 1989 (when I met my wife) - the feeling that it was impossible to determine what was really worthwhile.   Some of this came from reading Nietzsche and logical positivists, but most was probably due to being lonely.  I found it very hard to talk to people because I felt so different from them.  I wanted a girlfriend but I was too scared to go after the women I really liked.</p>

<p>That's interesting, because especially Heidegger gives me vibes of upcoming doom.

<p>If you read Camus' La Peste then you are in for a really gloomy time. I think there is something about that that gets one to think that any thought of life having meaning is an illusion. So if you want to also be a realist then you can only see the world in black. But it was the 1980s too, which were pretty bad somehow. Suddenly there were Goths, punks and Skin-heads around. (at least in the UK). So Nietzsche can have that effect too. Also the problem is that he deconstructs concepts such as causality, questioning everything. In the end it becomes difficult to think.</p>

<p>So I felt something similar regarding reason and logic having very young gotten into programming. That is exactly where modal logic was liberating. It showed how you could have logic and imagination combined. Plus one could start to see how concepts such as causality and knowledge could have interesting definitions.</p>

<p>Of course I read Camus in high school, and Kafka, and Dostoevsky, and everything else that fit my mood.  I don't think the zeitgeist had much to do with my problems - it was mainly my analyzing everything and not realizing that it's better to admit life mainly proceeds irrationally, driven by "animal spirits" rather than some deductive proof that some action is optimal.  </p>
<p>One big step on my "road to recovery" was joining a vegetarian coop in my last year of college at Princeton.  It was called 2 Dickinson St. and it's where all the misfits went: most students joined "eating clubs", the idea of which repelled me.  It being the late 80's, there was a mix of hippies and punks there.  Very nice people.  And so I had friends and a kind of community.  But this went away when I graduated and went to MIT... and I was very bad at seeking out compatible people, or environments, because I was so shy.</p>

<p>It's strange trying to imagine what I would have done differently if I were socially well-adjusted in college and grad school.   I probably would have worked on some trendy topic in mathematical physics and done a PhD thesis with some nice results in it, and gotten a better job.</p>

<p>I chose quantum gravity as a subject to work on because I enjoyed grandiose ambitions - in retrospect, those helped keep me happy.  I became very happy when I actually started working on loop quantum gravity in the early 1990s.   It was funny to hear that Lee Smolin had been working on that in the physics department at Yale back when I was a postdoc there (1987-1989).    I'd never known about him then, even though I met a student of his who was struggling to find solutions to some constraint equations (the initial data constraints for the Ashtekar formulation of general relativity, I now know).  The way he put it, it sounded hopeless, so I was not attracted.  If I'd met Smolin, who is much more optimistic always, I would have started work on loop quantum gravity about 3 years earlier!</p>

<p>In the end I feel my work on quantum gravity didn't accomplish much, but <em>at the time</em> there were moments of real ecstasy, like when I came up with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9709052">spin foams</a> in 1997.  In hindsight, the main good thing about all this work on quantum gravity was that I was trying to develop a category-theoretic approach to fundamental physics, and then I realized I needed an <em>n-categorical</em> approach, and this led me to meet James Dolan, and we figured out a lot of stuff.</p>

<p>There's a funny story about this in the physics literature on the "no-cloning theorem." Asher Peres recalls receiving and reviewing a paper that made some outlandish claims, which he knew were wrong, but not why. He encouraged the editors of the journal to publish the paper anyway. And that lead to the no-cloning theorem (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0205076">https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0205076</a>). That's a bit extreme though because the authors had made an incorrect assumption. But the point is that it lead to many new discoveries. And that could happen at any moment.</p>

<p>I learned a bit about categories when I was learning algebraic topology in grad school, and later as a postdoc when I was trying to understand things like cyclic cohomology and Hochschild homology - since they were important in Connes' work on noncommutative geometry.   But this was a fairly pedestrian form of category theory: abelian categories, and a bit of derived functors.  It was only much later, when I started understanding n-categories thanks to lots of conversations with James Dolan, that I really got <em>the point</em> about things like homological algebra: like, that chain complexes are strict stable infinity-groupoids, a very tractable sort of infinity-category.   Back then I just treated homological algebra the way most algebraists do, as some sort of computational framework.</p>

<p>In my early career I didn't know about topos theory.   If I'd heard about it sooner, from the right sort of person, I might have stayed interested in logic!  As an undergrad I got the impression that logic consisted of all these mind-blowing wonderful theorems like Tarski's undefinability of truth and Goedel's incompleteness theorems and the Loewenheim-Skolem theorems, followed by more technical stuff like forcing (which I didn't understand), followed by abstruse investigations of large cardinals, which seemed pointless to me.</p>

<p>I liked the idea that ultimately quantum gravity would be a very pure, very <em>algebraic</em> sort of thing - not just ordinary quantum field theory involving lots of geometry of manifolds.

<p>Categorical physics, by Louis Crane, preprint available as hep-th/9301061 in amstex.</p>
<p>A Categorical construction of 4d topological quantum field theories, by Louis Crane and David Yetter, preprint available as hep-th/9301062 in latex.</p>
<p>Hopf Categories and their representations, Louis Crane and Igor Frenkel, draft version.</p>
<p>Categorification and the construction of topological quantum field theory, Louis Crane and Igor Frenkel, draft version.</p>
<p>These outline Louis Crane's vision of an approach to generally covariant 4-dimensional quantum field theories (e.g. quantum gravity or a "theory of everything") based on 2-categories. "Categorical physics" sketches the big picture, while the paper with Yetter provides a juicy mathematical spinoff - the first known four-dimensional TQFT, based on the representations of quantum SU(2) and very similar in spirit to the Turaev-Viro construction of a 3d TQFT from quantum SU(2). The papers with Frenkel (apparently still not in their final form) describe the game plan and hint at marvelous things still to come. The conjecture is stated: "a 4d TQFT can be reconstructed from a tensor 2-category". This follows up on Crane's earlier work on getting 3d TQFTs from modular tensor categories (big example: the categories of representations of quantum groups at roots of unity). And the authors define the notion of a Hopf category, show how the category of module categories of a Hopf category is a tensor 2-category, and use "categorification" to turn the universal enveloping algebra of a quantum group into a Hopf category. Sound abstract? Indeed it is. But the aim is clear: to cook up 4d TQFTs from quantum groups. Such quantum field theories might be physically important; indeed, the one associated to SU(2) is likely to have a lot to do with quantum gravity.</p>
<p>I am currently perusing Kapranov and Voevodsky's massive paper on 2-categories, which seems to be the starting point for Crane's above papers and also those of Carter/Saito that I mentioned last week. Next week I should post an outline of what this paper does. </p>

<p>Interesting question!    I'm usually too worried about myself to think about whether <em>other</em> people are doing the right thing.   Too self-centered, I guess.   </p>
<p>I remember hearing about certain mathematicians who were really good at something and then switched, and how people were disappointed in this - like when Voevodsky stopped working on motivic cohomology.  But if you read about Voevodsky's turbulent mental state at the time you'll see why did this... and in this particular case, his later work on univalent foundations seems to have justified the switch.</p>

<p>He wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2006-2007 a lot of external and internal events happened to me, after which my point of view on the questions of the “supernatural” changed significantly. What happened to me during these years, perhaps, can be compared most closely to what happened to Karl Jung in 1913-14. Jung called it “confrontation with the unconscious”. I do not know what to call it, but I can describe it in a few words. Remaining more or less normal, apart from the fact that I was trying to discuss what was happening to me with people whom I should not have discussed it with, I had in a few months acquired a very considerable experience of visions, voices, periods when parts of my body did not obey me, and a lot of incredible accidents. The most intense period was in mid-April 2007 when I spent 9 days (7 of them in the Mormon capital of Salt Lake City), never falling asleep for all these days.</p>
<p>Almost from the very beginning, I found that many of these phenomena (voices, visions, various sensory hallucinations), I could control. So I was not scared and did not feel sick, but perceived everything as something very interesting, actively trying to interact with those “beings” in the auditorial, visual and then tactile spaces that appeared around me (by themselves or by invoking them). I must say, probably, to avoid possible speculations on this subject, that I did not use any drugs during this period, tried to eat and sleep a lot, and drank diluted white wine.</p>
<p>Another comment: when I say “beings”, naturally I mean what in modern terminology are called complex hallucinations. The word “beings” emphasizes that these hallucinations themselves “behaved”, possessed a memory independent of my memory, and reacted to attempts at communication. In addition, they were often perceived in concert in various sensory modalities. For example, I played several times with a (hallucinated) ball with a (hallucinated) girl—and I saw this ball, and felt it with my palm when I threw it.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that all this was very interesting, it was very difficult. It happened for several periods, the longest of which lasted from September 2007 to February 2008 without breaks. There were days when I could not read, and days when coordination of movements was broken to such an extent that it was difficult to walk.</p>
<p>I managed to get out of this state due to the fact that I forced myself to start math again. By the middle of spring 2008 I could already function more or less normally and even went to Salt Lake City to look at the places where I wandered, not knowing where I was, in the spring of 2007. </p>

<p>That reminds me of your point on logic and irrationality earlier.  One way I see these reconciled in modal logic is that the actual world is considered an indexical (but each of us has counterparts in other possible worlds). So we might mistakenly think we are in one world, and then through a realisation discover we need to shift the position in the space of possibilities where we are at. Could this indexicality be the logical anchor of "being in the world" of Heidegger? I think one can illustrate this with an example: someone walking down a dark street hears footsteps approaching them from behind. She does not want to turn around for fear of showing her fear.  At this point her world contains as close possibility ones that could involve unpleasant situations. Turning around she sees her brother. This information immediately leads to a reassessment of which worlds are close, which is the feeling of relief. The fear vanishes. The birds are chirping in the trees.</p>

<p>I recently had a lot of fun reading Pais' biography of Einstein, <em>Subtle is the Lord</em>.  I used to wonder a lot about how, after so many successes, he sank into completely unsuccessful work on unified field theories in his later years... basically after his work on general relativity in 1915, except for some small things.  ("Small things" for Einstein include his work on Bose-Einstein condensates, his paper on the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox, and his work on wormholes with Rosen!)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="281126">@Henry Story</span> I think Heidegger would reject trying to sidestep possible shortcomings of (classical predicate) logic alla early Russel via formalizations (such as formal modal logic.)

But actually, in many philosophy schools, I feel there's a general distain for what's taken to be a naive logicism.</p>

<p>Yes, basically I think Heidegger would have considered formal logic as part of what he called the "enframing" (the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestell">Gestell</a></em>).  This is the way of approaching the world  that underlies technology.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Such enframing pertains to the manner reality appears or unveils itself in the period of modern technology and people born into this "mode of ordering" are always embedded into the enframing.</p>

<p>But there is a huge transformation that occurs with Kripke and Hintikka onwards in logic. They actually introduce the concept of a frame (which I had never thought of as related to this enframing, as I have not read Heidegger directly, but only come across him via Bernard Stiegler, a philosopher of technology who is now very interested in entropy and negentropy, but from a humanities perspective).</p>

<p>I am mostly interested in it from reasoning about the architecture of the contemporary Gestell that is the Internet and the Web, where one has to reason about different points of views on reality. But I am not in a good position to tell what is easy and not easy in the space of CT. I was hoping it would all have been resolved by now.  It looks like I may have been overly optimistic. :-) <br>
Sorry for the interruption. Please continue.</p>

<p>Physicists are at an extra disadvantage compared to mathematicians because their training makes it hard for them to think abstractly.   Their training is focused on making them good at "becoming one with the physical system under study" - for example, knowing <em>by feel</em> what's the difference between an ordinary hydrogen atom and one with a muon replacing the electron.</p>

<p>Maybe.   I actually think most people do suck at teaching, though.   I get the best teaching evaluations in the math department at UCR, everyone wonders how I do it, and if I were honest I'd just say "I don't suck".  I pay a moderate amount of attention to avoiding some basic mistakes.  For example I try to make sure I only use words that the students already understand, or that I've already explained: I monitor what words come out of my mouth.   And so on.    Just basic stuff like that.</p>

<p>Anyhoo, I haven't really had a chance to teach category theory since I've started teaching again, so I'm not quite sure which books "don't suck". (You and I have disagreed about Mac Lane and probably will continue to do so, but I think part of the problem is that he was writing for a different generation and for more matured (professional) mathematicians.) Don't have an opinion about Goldblatt's pedagogy, but the complaints I remember is that he offers a skewed history and a skewed sense of what is important, i.e., is not scholarly enough for some tastes.</p>

<p>Sometimes I do touch upon categorical ideas in a class, but it's almost always obliquely and without using the word "category". For example, making analogies between things they may have seen before (the gcd is like the min, and it's also like the intersection, if you look at it right). I think introducing categorical ideas by looking first at posetal examples is not a bad way to go, but even there a lot is dependent on the audience. (Sorry, is this getting too far off-topic?)</p>

Colagebras for OO (Bart Jacobs), Functorial DBs (Spivak), FP (Bartosz Milewski). Then when I see a concept from maths I get really frightened as I have no idea how long it may take me to learn. I found that quite a few are not that difficult. (I am getting into topology a bit finally). But I can't tell. Is it going to take me a week or 3 years?</p>

<p>I'm the opposite of Henry: about all I know about programming comes from category theory.   If someone takes an idea from computer science and explains it using category theory, then I feel I understand it.  It's probably a delusion, but it's helpful nonetheless.</p>

<p>How about logic? For example, adjoint functors are everywhere in logic and set theory. A famous example is implication and its relation to exponentiation. Is that something the students might latch onto, you think?</p>

<p>The Yoneda lemma also made a really big impression on me when I was first learning category theory. I can't remember when I first really "got it", but really getting the point across is, I think, a critical point in the teaching and learning. Just curious how you would go about it.</p>

<p>I see. I can very much relate to that and have similar sentiments, although obviously based on much lesser knowledge of the subject. Somehow following the physics doesn't satisfy the aesthetics of a mathematical structuralist, while pursuing pure mathematical elegance tends to forget about the physics.</p>

<p>In the "condensed matter theory isn't fundmental" stance, I'm not sure if - even if we got our final theory - there'd be a nice way to move from the small to the larger. So in that way, it might never be the case that a "fundmental" theory would even derive the adhoc theories. Thus not making the in-between scales "redundant" even in principle/conceptually.<br>
Ehrenfest theorem would just be the correspondence of things in quantum and classical mechanics that bear the same name, but the identification would probably harder in a theory with as much bells and wizzles as a quantum gravity with potentially some fuzzy space and whatnot.</p>

<p>Yes, that's the dream.  The problem is, once you go away from TQFTs, you find yourself in a huge unexplored jungle of possible theories, without much of a clue as to which ones count as "good".</p>

<p>That's what I would do.   But I also feel that some people who are real <em>physicists</em> should systematically think about the conceptual and technical problems, and experimental puzzles, and start cataloging clues.  Physics is like a big jigsaw puzzle where the pieces are strewn all over the floor and you keep losing them because there are so many.</p>

<p>That's a good point. A lot of theorists wrote papers on superluminal neutrinos back in 2011 and on the 750 GeV diphoton excess in 2015, both of which turned out to be flukes (for very different reasons). The latest thing which may turn out to be of that sort seems to be the <a href="https://www.space.com/hubble-constant-discrepancy-explained.html">Hubble constant discrepancy</a>.</p>

<p>Even when I thought a lot about fundamental physics I found it very hard to remember all the clues and all the constraints at once.   This is what real experts are supposed to be able to do.  But it could be that as we progress in our understanding of physics we reach a point where no one person can keep all this stuff clearly in view!  So we rely on communities... but maybe communities tend to get stuck in specific narrow programs, where basically they're adding on extra constraints of the form "the solution must be like this or we're not interested in it"... so physics gets stuck.</p>
<p>On the other hand, maybe we just need someone smarter!  I really recommend reading Abraham Pais' book <em>Subtle is the Lord</em>, on Einstein.  I used to think Einstein came up with general relativity more or less by magic, or something like "you write down the only Lagrangian involving the metric and obeying these constraints" - which is how people often motivate it these days.    In fact he reasoned his way to it by a remarkable series of thoughts (and mistakes).  It makes me really appreciate how smart he was.</p>
<p>The reasoning that led him to invent "photons" was also remarkable - mostly statistical mechanics.   Which makes me even more interested in the connection between quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics.</p>

<p>If you mean politics v. linguistics, my sense is that Chomsky was pretty much both politically active and interested in the study of language right from the beginning. At university in the late 1940s he met Zellig Harris through left-wing politics who convinced Chomsky to study linguistics with him. This led to his early contributions to mathematical linguistics, and then generative grammar. He became for visible for his politics with the Vietnam War.</p>

<p>The annoying thing about noncartesian monoidal categories is that one has to <em>posit</em> the pentagon identity instead of being able to <em>prove</em> it.   My theory is that this is the sort of thing Lawvere hates: complicated coherence laws as axioms.   But for a monoidal poset, e.g. a quantale, the pentagon identity is automatic.</p>

<p>I also feel that since Leiden2018 the whole ACT thing started accelerating A LOT. Maybe i'm wrong but I think ACT now is like it was doing Machine Learning in the early 2000</p>

<p>Another good sign, imho, is that I see quite a lot of pure category theorists are starting to dive into ACT. This is again a verry good sign. And it connects with what you are saying. I think what we need right now is that people that are experts in the theoretical stuff come over importing new amazing tools</p>

<p>Who around here is teaching category theory? I do just a teeny amount, in the context of "independent studies" at my university (more like "dependent studies"). I'm curious who might have used Emily's book for teaching purposes.</p>

<p>I just read Barwick's manifesto on homotopy theory, and I was struck by this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We need to stop identifying ourselves as topologists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately I think that would be a bad idea, politically - sort of like math departments seceding from the college of sciences.   If homotopy theorists stop calling themselves topologists, other mathematicians will wonder what they are, and what good they are.  At least this is true unless and until homotopy theory becomes a lot better understood in its own right by many non-homotopy-theorists.</p>

<p>I think the dire position doesn't have to do with the lack of people considering homotopy theory a "big deal", but rather the internal workings of the field. The two points that Clark brings up that ring the most true in my experience are (1) the prevalence of unpublished and unshared work being taken as finished, and (2) the pedagogical aspects. There are no books that <em>teach</em> homotopy theory, and that's a travesty</p>

<p>I like CWM now, but when I tried to learn CT from it ages ago I felt that its choice of letters was weird and that lots of important diagrams were omitted from the book - and that I would have to reconstruct them myself. Then I stumbled on a paper that Peter Freyd that later became the basis for "Categories, Allegories" and started using its diagrammatic language to draw my diagrams and I became a weirdo.</p>

<p>That's just odd.  It would be so fun to explain it.  I've considered writing a book called something like "Homotopy Theory for Dummies", but that would not be the text that you think needs to be written, namely one that lays out all the modern machinery in a nice way - it'd be an attempt to demystify what's going on, and paint the big picture, without a lot of technical stuff.</p>

<p>That's just odd.  It would be so fun to explain it.  I've considered writing a book called something like "Homotopy Theory for Dummies", but that would not be the text that you think needs to be written, namely one that lays out all the modern machinery in a nice way - it'd be an attempt to demystify what's going on, and paint the big picture, without a lot of technical stuff.</p>

<p>I <strong>absolutely</strong> agree. I've been considering starting a book project on factorization homology, and using that as motivation to teach a bunch of modern homotopy theory that is distinctly different from the "computational stable homotopy theory" stuff that causes spectral sequences to appear in nightmares</p>

<p>I think your criticisms of his points are valid, and a healthy debate in my opinion! I really look up to Clark as a mathematician and as a person doing mathematics (there's a philosophical distinction that could open a whole can of worms....) and I'm heartened by his concern for the field, which is borne only out of love. But it's strictly a good thing to hear that certain concerns may no longer be valid! Homotopy theory has grown <em>a lot</em> in the last 3 years.</p>

<p>I learned a bit about categories when I was learning algebraic topology in grad school, and later as a postdoc when I was trying to understand things like cyclic cohomology and Hochschild homology - since they were important in Connes' work on noncommutative geometry.   But this was a fairly pedestrian form of category theory: abelian categories, and a bit of derived functors.  It was only much later, when I started understanding n-categories thanks to lots of conversations with James Dolan, that I really got <em>the point</em> about things like homological algebra: like, that chain complexes are strict stable infinity-groupoids, a very tractable sort of infinity-category.   Back then I just treated homological algebra the way most algebraists do, as some sort of computational framework.</p>

<p>One thing, from my naive perspective, I see Category Theory as is a translation mechanism. It helps people from different fields communicate, or show them that they are looking at the same thing from a different angle. For example I was amazed to see the Object Oriented Thinking had a CT model, coalgebras,  (Bart Jacobs' papers from the 90s) the dual of what Functional programmers like to use - algebras. That suddenly makes both a lot more interesting. Or recently constructive logic and co-constructive logics: suddenly I can see how Popper ties in with type theories via topoi.  Before that I would have not given a thought to Paraconsistent logic. But to know that it is the dual of constructive logic! Suddenly it is not an arbitrary thing...

<p>There was a whole discussion on the thread <a href="#narrow/stream/229136-theory.3A-category.20theory/topic/Bi-Heyting.20algebras">Bi-Heyting Algebras</a> that I came to reading <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319472041">Meaning in Dialogue</a> by James Trafford. There is something that was not quite clear there regarding the view of complemenl-topoi he builds on, but the main idea of a co-heyting algebras as the dual of a heyting algebras seems to be solid, and it looks that it is what Popper was working with as explained in <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11225-005-8474-7">Dual Intuitionistic Logic and a Variety of Negations: The Logic of Scientific Research</a>.</p>

<p>if "gloomy path" means the end of the mankind, isn't worrying about that similar to worrying that i will die? seems superfluous. i spent a lot of time reading heidegger (at high school!) and i thought that i understaood him. but i don't think i understand him any more. i think he does not mean what he says. many people don't speak for themselves, but speak for an inner voice. i don't think that inner voice is worth listening to. it has a logic, but is not interested in the same things as we. i think that is the secret of heidegger.</p>

<p>Not really no. I might be not worried that indeed I die one day, but I might be worried that future generation will live in a polluted world. In a similar vain, Marx critique in Alienated Labour points towards a darker impact on human life than "just" death. <br>
And similarly, Heidegger's thoughts on Technik are about how humans perception are molded (sunlight and water becoming perceived as resources, etc.), making experience today uncomparable to experience of previous human lives. In practical cases: The first person who owns a car being in the advantageous position to now even being able to take a working position 100km from his house, and 100 years later the world having changed so much because of this possibility, the people end up living in places where they actually can't go to work anymore. In more philosophical cases: The scientific possibilities resulting in advantages by focusing on that what is measurable (and thus optimizable) and 100 years later, people taking the point of view that what is not measurable is not real. The "cyclic world" perspective, where things eventually always repeat, is a bit more hopeful than the post-Hegelian world-strives-towards perspective, since our current projections are worse than just some people eventually having to pass.</p>

<p>Hi John,<br>
thanks for all this. It is really nice and interesting to hear your history and its turns. And physics and maths -- it is an immense span of topics, and very interesting to hear your path through them. And those things about feeling insecure or different -- I think many mathematicians feel like that in one way or another. But it is almost shocking to hear such things from somebody so super-cool and relaxed and communicative like you. That's something to think about. Perhaps we can all learn to be more relaxed and communicative.</p>

<p>If someone were influenced by Hegel they would have a quick way to being anti-Platonic I guess.<br>
Nietzsche laid a lot of errors at the feet of Plato. His positing of the eternal heaven of non-mutable abstract objects is one of the reproaches, and its later effects on Christianity. Hegel was perhaps the first in the modern times  who saw a  thought as evolving dynamically. There were ancients esp. Empedocles who had prototypical evolutionary views of life and the cosmos as I discovered recently in <a href="https://www.academia.edu/38903371/The_End_of_the_Metaphysics_of_Being_and_the_Beginning_of_the_Metacosmics_of_Entropy_2019_">The End of the Metaphysics of Being and the Beginning of the Metacosmics of Entropy</a>. Heraclitus "No man steps in the same river twice" would be another emphasizing change.<br>
I wonder if one can find the following reconciliation between Plato and Heraclitus. Could one think of Plato's philosophy as Algebraic (influenced as Plato was by writing), and Heraclitus as co-Algebraic? (Co-algebras being the mathematics of processes, change, modalities, ...)?</p>

<p>Even when I thought a lot about fundamental physics I found it very hard to remember all the clues and all the constraints at once.   This is what real experts are supposed to be able to do.  But it could be that as we progress in our understanding of physics we reach a point where no one person can keep all this stuff clearly in view!  So we rely on communities... but maybe communities tend to get stuck in specific narrow programs, where basically they're adding on extra constraints of the form "the solution must be like this or we're not interested in it"... so physics gets stuck.</p>

<p>A little while ago on <a class="stream" data-stream-id="233322" href="/#narrow/stream/233322-practice.3A-communication">#practice: communication</a>  there was a discussion of what the future of publication and academic output should look like. This metaphor about keeping sight of all the clues gives a nice way of expressing the vision that I and others shared there: to have an open network, like a detective's pinboard, with all the clues visible to everyone. Having everything literally in sight would help us all a lot, I believe.</p>

<p>No, I never tried to follow any work on this hypothesis.   Progress on this began right around the time I decided that I needed to leave the subject of n-categories and start thinking about something new: climate change, and what mathematicians can do about that.  I've gradually become interested in higher categories again, but it's no fun for me to try to catch up with this line of work.  The train has left the station.</p>

<p>Homological algebra is what you get when you take the full force of infinity-category theory and water it down in three different ways.  These 3 ways each weaken the subject - i.e., make it less rich and less expressive.  But correspondingly they also make it easier to do computations.</p>

<p>These 3 ways are:</p>
<p>1) making all the j-morphisms in your infinity-category <em>invertible</em> (up to higher morphisms).</p>
<p>2) making all forms of composition <em>strictly associative</em> (and obey all other laws strictly).</p>

<p>It turns out that the original Azimuth Project idea - getting people to volunteer to help figure out stuff to do about climate change - did not work very well.   Academics did not buy into this effort, perhaps because it had no institutional backing and I was an amateur in this area.   The people who helped out were mainly computer programmers working in industry.   But I was ineffective at harnessing their power.</p>

<p>Well, last week I spent a lot of time thinking about Galois cohomology for the purposes of understanding the role of division algebras in quantum mechanics.   Now I'm going to change gears and write a paper on Noether's theorem.  That's a fairly small turn for me - they're both projects in trying to understand the foundations of physics.  But if I had a grad student working on these things it'd count as a sharp turn, because they'd need to spend months learning the prerequisites.  And just imagine if I told this grad student "next month I want to work on chemical reaction networks".</p>

<p>One of the rules we had (and have) on the Azimuth Project is: no discussion of politics, esp. party politics.   This is difficult because in some ways the problem of climate change is very much about politics.

<p>The initial goal of category theory was to formally define what a "natural transformation" is. The problem that motivated Eilenberg-McLane came from homological algebra, and once they solved that problem, they were able to do more with homological algebra. In that sense, category theory was no more than a tool to be used in homological algebra.</p>
<p>But it turns out that category theory wasn't just a tool of homological algebra. It turned out that you could do a lot more with it, like set up an alternative foundation for mathematics, structure computer programs, etc.</p>
<p>So you're right that the original goal of homological algebra was to compute invariants, but that doesn't mean homological algebra can't evolve into something else. As it turns out, the chain complexes studied in homological algebra are actually invariants themselves. The new realisation that John's talking about is that the proper objects of study in homological algebra should be chain complexes. </p>
<p>In some sense, the invariants that chain complexes compute are shadows on the wall cast by the chain complexes themselves. Rather than computing those invariants, the people who work with derived geometry and higher category theory want to study the complexes themselves because they're believed to "contain more information".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>there is hardly any doubt about any of what you are saying, except maybe the very last part. homological algebra, just like any other method or even any piece of software, <em>can</em> certainly evolve into anything. but i thought john said that he saw that homological algebra <em>has</em> evolved into something different from a method to compute things. so my question was what.</p>
<p>i imagine that that new thing might be the subject of the belief, that you mention, that simplicial complexes "contain more information". what about? the original idea was that they should reduce geometric invariants to combinatorial invariants. fair enough. now there is a belief that they actually contain more information. i don't see how can that be. maybe information about something else? also, if we believe that something contains some information about something, shouldn't we test that belief by spelling out some adjunction? if it does not go, then what are the grounds for the belief? discussing beliefs has led to a lot of confusion, historically.</p>

<p>yes, i think i have seen another set of your slides about this. very nice and elegant. i do love it as a story. what worries me about the strategy, though, is that people usually simplify problems by reducing them to lower dimensions, whereas here the strategy seems to be to push them up. that has been curious with the homotopy hypothesis from the outset. the pictures become beautiful, but they don't become simple. isn't that the direction where we should go? if we are to overcome the era of printing and of command line mathematics, and go back to thinking in pictures and geometry, shouldn't we use pictures that live in our own space?</p>

<p>He wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2006-2007 a lot of external and internal events happened to me, after which my point of view on the questions of the “supernatural” changed significantly. What happened to me during these years, perhaps, can be compared most closely to what happened to Karl Jung in 1913-14. Jung called it “confrontation with the unconscious”. I do not know what to call it, but I can describe it in a few words. Remaining more or less normal, apart from the fact that I was trying to discuss what was happening to me with people whom I should not have discussed it with, I had in a few months acquired a very considerable experience of visions, voices, periods when parts of my body did not obey me, and a lot of incredible accidents. The most intense period was in mid-April 2007 when I spent 9 days (7 of them in the Mormon capital of Salt Lake City), never falling asleep for all these days.</p>
<p>Almost from the very beginning, I found that many of these phenomena (voices, visions, various sensory hallucinations), I could control. So I was not scared and did not feel sick, but perceived everything as something very interesting, actively trying to interact with those “beings” in the auditorial, visual and then tactile spaces that appeared around me (by themselves or by invoking them). I must say, probably, to avoid possible speculations on this subject, that I did not use any drugs during this period, tried to eat and sleep a lot, and drank diluted white wine.</p>
<p>Another comment: when I say “beings”, naturally I mean what in modern terminology are called complex hallucinations. The word “beings” emphasizes that these hallucinations themselves “behaved”, possessed a memory independent of my memory, and reacted to attempts at communication. In addition, they were often perceived in concert in various sensory modalities. For example, I played several times with a (hallucinated) ball with a (hallucinated) girl—and I saw this ball, and felt it with my palm when I threw it.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that all this was very interesting, it was very difficult. It happened for several periods, the longest of which lasted from September 2007 to February 2008 without breaks. There were days when I could not read, and days when coordination of movements was broken to such an extent that it was difficult to walk.</p>
<p>I managed to get out of this state due to the fact that I forced myself to start math again. By the middle of spring 2008 I could already function more or less normally and even went to Salt Lake City to look at the places where I wandered, not knowing where I was, in the spring of 2007. </p>

<p>No, I studied with him at MIT ~1982-1985, and around then he left MIT and got a job at Oxford, and I never saw him again.  When I was at MIT I also took two courses on homotopy theory with G. W. Whitehead, but it was basic stuff; I never went deeper so I never attended Kan's seminar.   Much later I spent a bunch of time reading Quillen's <em>Homotopical Algebra</em>, which is his book on model categories.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I don't think of this as pushing something up.    From the eyes of homotopy theory a 2-sphere is an infinity-groupoid - and a very complicated one indeed: nobody even knows all the groups of equivalence classes of automorphisms of automorphisms of automorphisms... automorphisms of an object in this infinity-groupoid!    It's a very rich and fascinating structure.  When we "stabilize" the 2-sphere, it simplifies a lot and becomes the sphere spectrum, which is more manageable but still quite rich.   When we then "strictify" it, it becomes even simpler and turns into a very simple chain complex.   So homological algebra is a great simplifier.  It's basically a way of turning infinity-groupoids into slightly glorified linear algebra.   It serves as a stepping-stone toward understanding the really interesting stuff in homotopy theory: the world of infinity-groupoids.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I don't think so.   Pictures are good for 2- and 3-dimensional things, but a lot of the fun in topology lives in higher dimensions, where we need to use concepts rather than pictures.   Of course <em>algebraic</em> topology uses lots of commutative diagrams, and that's a great way to keep things vivid.</p>

<p>I can answer this one: it's the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox">Jevons paradox</a>, that greater efficiency typically doesn't result in reduced consumption; rather, it facilitates consumption by making scarce resources more accessible. Doing 'more of the same' therefore often means failing to reallocate resources to the urgent problems while indirectly exacerbating them. <span aria-label="grimacing" class="emoji emoji-1f62c" role="img" title="grimacing">:grimacing:</span></p>

<p>I'm coming back to this because I have a question.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why is this discouraging?</strong></p>
<p>I suppose that, for certain definitions of "do what we're already doing", it can seem like we're going down a path of doom and gloom. But one thing that we're already doing is trying to build a "better" world, whatever that means. And quite a lot of that would actually entail doing things <em>faster</em> and <em>more efficiently</em>.</p>
<p>So why is that a "bad" thing? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a big subject, which is worth a lot of thought.    You mentioned <em>speed</em> and <em>efficiency</em>.</p>
<p>First, the human race is pushing the biosphere to dangerous tipping points by ever-increasing modification of the basic parameters of the atmosphere, oceans, forests, etc.   This is the Anthropocene phenomenon I summarized very briefly <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/balsillie/balsillie_what.pdf">here</a> (see especially page 3).   <em>Speeding up</em> this process doesn't seem like the best way to ensure a happy ending.   Of course we need to do <em>some</em> things quickly, but an overall acceleration, caused by improved technologies of a highly generalized sort (e.g. applied category theory), is just as likely to hurt as to help.</p>
<p>Second, it's not at all clear that increased efficiency reduces resource use.  Quite possibly it does the opposite.   Here's a good article on that:</p>
<p><span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext>  </mtext></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\;</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>Seems like the energy consumption topic would make a lot of enemies. <br>
"Do I want to be the person talking about the is and ought of managing population growth?"<br>
"Do I want to be the person talking about restricting the way people go on about business?". <br>
"Do I want to be the person talking about restricting travel?". <br>
Scientists and hackers want to do their thing - bonus if it has an impact that people would like or be interested in them for it - but getting into argument might not seem compatible with that.</p>

<p>Yes, the point of <em>Azimuth</em> was not to design regulations, which is what your three topics are about.

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Millikan">Ruth Garett Millikan</a> wrote an interesting book <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=jncHBAYe8TkC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=language+thought+and+other+biological+categories&amp;ots=Xyg6zKpphf&amp;sig=W488HM1jhaA_OYmPJTBic6WJ7n0#v=onepage&amp;q=language%20thought%20and%20other%20biological%20categories&amp;f=false">Language, Thought and Other Biological Categories</a> in 1984, which starts from a enlarged conception of the category of the biological as that which concern things that need the concept of reproduction to be understood, as opposed to physical objects in which the notion does not appear. That allows her then to define the proper function of bodies parts as given by evolution, and from there placing language in the biological category.  One would need to be careful not to reduce thought to the biological and bring in Robert Brandom's point that speaking a language also brings in the notion of inference, and a duty to answer for what one says, and be able to question what someone says.  But she uses it to good effect to bring to light an aspect of language that may be overlooked if one only takes the inferentialist view. This way of thinking opens up the view of thought as evolutionary, and so opens up a space to talk about the ecology of ideas, of technics and life itself of course. I don't think she does that (but I have not read all her work).Her notion of a category here is not that from Category Theory, but perhaps something could be developed along those lines.</p>

<p>That book could be interesting.  It will take a lot of thought to go through the literature on biology and ecology and "general systems theory" and extract some insights that can be turned into mathematics in a useful way.  I want to do it.  My work on <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/">network theory</a> was supposed to be a first step - but it's only a small step.</p>

(It is difficult to see from the article which is purely mathematical, and does not give a history of the concept analyses or why it is related to the concept of systems (or which concept of systems it is related to). I just watched a talk by Catarina Duthil Novaes <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/arche/event/conceptual-engineering-seminar-3-2020-05-26/">Carnap meets Foucault: Conceptual engineering and genealogical investigations</a> where she pointed out that Carnap leaves on open space in his work for genealogical thinking. I think this is related to how Carnap explains the evolution of concepts where he states that before giving a definition one should consider the usage of the term, give examples etc... This is usually done in philosophy, but perhaps less in mathematics where I guess the structure is meant to speak for itself. )</p>

<p>Petri nets, electrical circuits and Markov chains are a nice simple examples of networks, so I've been using them as test cases for general theories of networks, like Brendan Fong's <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05382">decorated cospans</a> or Kenny Courser's <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04630">structured cospans</a>.  (These are students of mine who developed general approaches to networks.)</p>
<p>I haven't thought enough about coalgebras to incorporate them in my thinking on networks.   More precisely, I've thought a lot about coalgebras in representation theory (a Hopf algebra is a coalgebra with extra structure), but not about the Turi-Plotkin paper <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/gdp/publications/Math_Op_Sem.pdf">Toward a mathematical operational semantics</a>, which seems like a good starting-point for me to understand coalgebraic methods in computer science.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span> one place this (coalgebra) may emerge in your recent work is the notion of equivalence induced by "bisimulation" -- two processes  (resp nets)  are bisimilar if each simulates the other, with simulation a relation that sends objects of one to objects of the other such that every transition in the first process has a matching transition in the second process, roughly. This is a pretty fine-grained notion of equivalence, and there are also "up to" methods for weakening it, etc. So you actually get a zoo of different notions of bisimulation. Anyway, the fanciest way for organizing this zoo and understanding the approach in general is to think of it as a categorical equivalence of the coalgebras induced by these processes.</p>

<p>There are some technical errors in the talk that I need to fix.  But I'm also trying to dig deeper now into the relation between Lie algebras and Jordan algebras, each of which capture one half of the meaning of "observables" in quantum mechanics.  So that's being fun.</p>

<p>I've gotten the idea that the Lie algebra structure of observables captures the "internal" meaning of observables - they generate symmetries, e.g. dynamics - while the Jordan algebra structure captures their "external" meaning, namely how you observe them "from outside".  I don't know if I can make this precise.</p>

<p>More about "future stuff":</p>
<p>1) I've applied for a Leverhulme Trust grant to visit Tom Leinster in Edinburgh in the fall of 2021 and the fall of 2022.   In the grant proposal the plan is for me to give lectures on topics from <em>This Week's Finds</em>.  Stuff like this:</p>
<p>1.1. Young diagrams. Young diagrams are simple combinatorial struc-<br>
tures that show up in a myriad of applications. Among other things<br>
they classify conjugacy classes in symmetric groups, irreducible rep-<br>
resentations of symmetric groups, irreducible representations of the<br>
groups SL(n; F) for any field F of characteristic zero, and irreducible<br>
complex representations of the groups SU(n). All these facts are tightly<br>
connected, and the central idea is that Young diagrams are irreducible<br>
objects in the category of "Schur functors". These are functors that<br>
know how to act on the category of representations of any group, and<br>
other similar categories as well.</p>
<p>1.2. Dynkin diagrams. Coxeter and Dynkin diagrams classify a wide<br>
variety of structures: most notably, finite groups of transformations of<br>
<span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi mathvariant="double-struck">R</mi><mi>n</mi></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{R}^n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68889em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathbb">R</span></span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.664392em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mathdefault mtight">n</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> generated by reflections (called "Coxeter groups"), <br>
lattices having such reflection groups as their symmetries, and simple Lie algebras.<br>
The special class of "simply laced" Dynkin diagrams also classifies the<br>
Platonic solids, the quivers with finitely many indecomposable repre-<br>
sentations, and other structures. Thus, a tour of Coxeter and Dynkin<br>
diagrams that doesn't get bogged down in the sometimes rather tech-<br>
nical proofs of the fundamental results is a good way to see connections<br>
between a wide range of mathematical topics.</p>

<p>1.3. q-Mathematics. A surprisingly large portion of mathematics can<br>
be seen as a special case of more general "q-mathematics" arising when<br>
we set the parameter q equal to 1. For example the usual derivative of<br>
a function on the real line is the q = 1 case of something called the \q-<br>
derivative", and there is a subject called "q-calculus" that generalizes<br>
ordinary calculus to other values of q. There are important applications<br>
of q-mathematics to the theory of quantum groups (a generalization of<br>
ordinary groups), and also to algebraic geometry over <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="double-struck">F</mi><mi>q</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{F}_q</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.974998em;vertical-align:-0.286108em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathbb">F</span></span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.15139200000000003em;"><span style="top:-2.5500000000000003em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mathdefault mtight" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">q</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.286108em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>, <br>

exist.</p>

<p>1.8. The tenfold way. When we generalize algebras to "superalgebras"- <br>
that is, algebras in the category of Z/2-graded vector<br>
spaces -we find that the three real division algebras fit into a larger<br>
collection: the ten real "super division algebras". All ten of these al-<br>
gebras are Clifford algebras: eight are real Clifford algebras and two<br>
are complex Clifford algebras. This mathematics has recently found<br>
applications to condensed matter physics, where it is called the \ten-<br>
fold way". The ten real super division algebra are also connected to<br>
the ten infinite families of symmetric spaces. The threefold way is a<br>
prerequisite for this topic.</p>

<p>1.9. The octonions. Besides the three associative normed division<br>
algebras over the real numbers, there is a fourth one that is nonasso-<br>
ciative: the octonions. They arise naturally from the fact that Spin(8)<br>
has three irreducible 8-dimensional representations. The exceptional<br>
Lie algebras can all be constructed using octonions. This is especially<br>
attractive in the case of E8, whose weight lattice can be identified with<br>
the "Cayley integral octonions": a lattice of octonions closed under<br>
multiplication. The quaternions and Clifford algebras are prerequisites<br>
for this topic.</p>

<p>1.12. Euler characteristic and homotopy cardinality. We all know<br>
what it means for a set to have 6 elements, but what sort of thing has<br>
-1 elements, or 5/2? Surprisingly, these questions have nice answers.<br>
The Euler characteristic of a space is a generalization of cardinality<br>
that admits negative integer values, while the homotopy cardinality is<br>
a generalization that admits positive real values. These concepts shed<br>
new light on basic mathematics. For example, the space of finite sets<br>
turns out to have homotopy cardinality e, and this explains the key<br>
properties of the exponential function. Euler characteristic and ho-<br>
motopy cardinality share many properties, but it's hard to tell if they<br>
are the same, because there are very few spaces for which both are<br>
well-defined. However, in many cases where one is well-defined, the<br>
other may be computed by dubious manipulations involving divergent<br>
series|and the two then agree! We discuss some progress on unifying<br>
them - notably Leinster's Euler charactestic of a category - and also<br>
some obstacles, noticed by John Lerman.</p>

<p>1.13. The Rosetta Stone. In physics, Feynman diagrams are used<br>
to reason about quantum processes. In the 1980s, it became clear<br>
that underlying these diagrams is a powerful analogy between quan-<br>
tum physics and topology. Namely, a linear operator behaves very<br>
much like a "cobordism": a manifold representing spacetime, going be-<br>
tween two manifolds representing space. This led to a burst of work on<br>
topological quantum field theory and "quantum topology". But this<br>
was just the beginning: similar diagrams can be used to reason about<br>
logic, where they represent proofs, and computation, where they rep-<br>
resent programs. By now it is clear that there is extensive network<br>
of analogies between physics, topology, logic and computation. The<br>
concept of "closed symmetric monoidal category" serves as a kind of<br>
Rosetta Stone allowing to translate concepts between these fields.</p>

<p>2x2 and 3x3 self-adjoint matrices of octonions are better because the octonions are "alternative": the subalgebra generated by any two octonions is associative.  We can also take advantage of the  self adjointness: 1) the diagonal entries of a self-adjoint matrix are real, so they associate with all octonions, 2) the subalgebra generated by <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>a</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>b</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><msup><mi>a</mi><mo>∗</mo></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">a,b,a^\ast</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8888799999999999em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">a</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.16666666666666666em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">b</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.16666666666666666em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathdefault">a</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.688696em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mbin mtight">∗</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> and <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>b</mi><mo>∗</mo></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">b^\ast</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.69444em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathdefault">b</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.688696em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mbin mtight">∗</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> is associative for any pair of octonions <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>a</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">a</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">a</span></span></span></span> and <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>b</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">b</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.69444em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">b</span></span></span></span>.</p>

<p>It's hard to estimate the mean time it takes for me to write and publish a paper because it's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail">long-tailed distribution</a>.  As with the Cauchy distribution, the mean may not actually exist because the integral diverges.</p>

<p>No category theory per se, but a lot of math and physics.   In the last couple of weeks, working on this paper, I'm getting glimpses of some foundational ideas on physics that really intrigue me.   I'm not sure I'll have time to solidify them in this paper.   But it's exciting.  </p>
<p>These ideas are about the dual meaning of "observable" in physics: you can see what I mean in my talk slides at the above link.   The big question is whether we can exploit this to make new progress in physics.</p>

<p>Thanks!   Btw, I've been wanting to talk to you more about combinatorics and category theory.  I mentioned that once.  I'm finally starting to get enough time.</p>
<p>One idea I had was to look at things like homotopy species (I guess you know what I mean by <em>that</em>) but where we replace finite sets by finite "spin sets".</p>
<p>Long after talking to you about "homotopy combinatorics", I found that people already study <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1110.0263">"spin representations" of the symmmetric group</a>.  These are actually representations of certain"double covers" of the spin groups, i.e. nontrivial central extensions </p>

<p>So, a "spin set" is a thing like a set where switching a pair of elements twice isn't the identity; you have to switch them four times to get the identity.</p>

<p>Hi John, I would like to come back to this. The paper looks very interesting. I will look into it. On the other hand, spin representations of the symmetric groups sound difficult :-( I am already having a lot of trouble with just ordinary representations of the symmetric groups, from the viewpoint of objective combinatorics.</p>
<p>I am surprised you say that you need 4 switches of a pair of elements to get back to the identity.

<p>Do these sets somehow inject into physically relevant theories?</p>

<p>Hi John, I would like to come back to this. The paper looks very interesting. I will look into it. On the other hand, spin representations of the symmetric groups sound difficult :-( I am already having a lot of trouble with just ordinary representations of the symmetric groups, from the viewpoint of objective combinatorics.</p>

<p>What are you trying to do with them?   In math the trick is not to get into more trouble than you can get out of.  </p>
<p>The more trouble you can get out of, the more you should get into.</p>

<p>So this makes we wonder if there are String covers for the symmetric groups. Nora Ganter and a student worked on String covers for the Platonic groups, so passing from the ADE subgroups of SO(3) to the corresponding subgroups of SU(2)=Spin(3) to the corresponding subgroups of String(3). These turn out to be nontrivial 2-group extensions, so... the symmetric group case?</p>

<p>1.3. q-Mathematics. A surprisingly large portion of mathematics can<br>
be seen as a special case of more general "q-mathematics" arising when<br>
we set the parameter q equal to 1. For example the usual derivative of<br>
a function on the real line is the q = 1 case of something called the \q-<br>
derivative", and there is a subject called "q-calculus" that generalizes<br>
ordinary calculus to other values of q. There are important applications<br>
of q-mathematics to the theory of quantum groups (a generalization of<br>
ordinary groups), and also to algebraic geometry over <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi mathvariant="double-struck">F</mi><mi>q</mi></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{F}_q</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.974998em;vertical-align:-0.286108em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathbb">F</span></span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.15139200000000003em;"><span style="top:-2.5500000000000003em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mathdefault mtight" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">q</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.286108em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>, <br>

<p>Have you looked at doubly affine Hecke algebras? They seem to unify nicely some aspects of q-mathematics with many facets of Lie theory. Every now and then I read sections of:</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0404307.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0404307.pdf</a></p>

<p>Double affine Hecke algebras (DAHA) are Cherednik's generalisation of affine Hecke algebras, which come up in <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/affine-hecke-algebras-and-orthogonal-polynomials/5659BB708682886AAA7292E803A24FB0">Macdonald's study of orthogonal polynomials</a>. Cherednik <a href="https://academic.oup.com/imrn/article-abstract/1992/9/171/798121">defined</a> them to study the classical and quantum Knizhnik–Zamolodchikov (KZ) equations, as well as Macdonald polynomials, and succeeded in using DAHA to <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2118632">prove Macdonald's constant term conjecture</a> for general reduced root systems.</p>

<p>I read lots of papers this way: I know what kind of things I want to learn about, and I search for those things.  This particular style of reading is very ruthless, sort of like ripping open the paper, grabbing the best parts, and ignoring the rest.   I think a lot of beginners don't know how to do this.</p>

<p>But then there are other papers and especially books where I take a more submissive attitude: I've decided I want to learn whatever they have to say.   I still read these in a very nonlinear way, not at all from start to end.  I go for the parts that make sense, then expand out from there.   Usually the parts that make sense to me are those with the highest word/math symbol ratio.   I often don't bother looking at equations until I know what's going on.</p>

<p>I try to form a <em>broad, somewhat vague but still conceptually clear</em> picture of an area before trying to understand details: when you have a broad picture, you can understand the details a lot faster, because you can tell what they're good for.   It's like a scaffolding on which you can hang the facts you learn.</p>

<p>Mostly because "ain't nobody got time" to read a book from cover to cover. It's probably a shame, but I think that reading is also a means to an end. Just because an author has structured the material in one way doesn't mean you have to follow that order strictly, or that the presented order will necessarily be exactly what you need. It also goes with the flow of human psychology: if you read with an agenda in mind, you tend to read more actively, instead of dozing off, as many people end up doing when they go in, teeth gnashing, with the "I'm gonna read this entire book" mentality.</p>

<p>I agree.  But sometimes, maybe after reading it once, I realize a paper is book is so good I need to read it in a more "submissive" manner, where I trust that it's full of wisdom and I should just try my best to absorb it.</p>

<p>I feel like most of the time-constraints––ironically––come from thinking you're so time-constrained that you rapidly switch between tasks, getting 10-50% as much done in the same time as a result. At least, that's what I've seen from "busy" professors I know. And given that there have been many professors, like Douglas Walton or Niklas Luhmann, who published thousands of articles and books, in addition to managing department responsibilities, it makes me think the complainers are running at closer to 10% efficiency. I wonder if anyone has ever done a study of how self-perceived business affects academic productivity.</p>

<p>I feel like most of the time-constraints––ironically––come from thinking you're so time-constrained that you rapidly switch between tasks, getting 10-50% as much done in the same time as a result. At least, that's what I've seen from "busy" professors I know. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Switching between tasks is certainly not productive, but what if you <em>have no choice</em> because you do have a lot of other tasks at hand? Unless you're in the fortunate position of an academic whose career is solely dependent on just one task (teaching <em>or</em> research), some switching is probably inevitable. Of course, one could argue that "busy" academics need better time management, but often the non-research (teaching and/or admin) tasks aren't scheduled by you.</p>
<p>This is also a problem faced by software developers in the industry, which is why there's a visceral hatred for things that have a knack for producing non-coding tasks, such as open-plan offices and the various "agile" methodologies, peddled by management types, that pay lip service to the original Agile Manifesto. People who have kids and were forced to work from home during the quarantine have also found that out the hard way, while the frazzled but single software developers have generally reported loving the WFH arrangements and aren't in any hurry to get back to the distracting office soon.</p>

<p>And given that there have been many professors, like Douglas Walton or Niklas Luhmann, who published thousands of articles and books, in addition to managing department responsibilities, it makes me think the complainers are running at closer to 10% efficiency. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't doubt that people who complain about a lack of time tend not to be all that efficient at using it, but Walton and Luhmann worked in a different discipline, so it's a bit like comparing apples and oranges. <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="276422">David Michael Roberts</span> and I used to know an applied mathematician who's reputed to pump out one paper a week on top of his editorial duties.

<p>That's fair. In math, the hard earned fluency comes before the productivity. That's probably why it looks like junior students and professors barely produce anything at first. Math is what learning scientists call a "kind learning environment" where it's "easy" to learn (though grueling repetition) but "hard" to pick up casually.</p>

<p>Also, I don't mean to contribute to the "blame the professor" culture in universities. Career administrators with lots of "ideas" about scholarship are probably the source of most of the research and teaching friction, though I can't know that for sure as a student.</p>

<p>It's taking me a lot of work to go through and correct Kenny's thesis since it's 267 pages long.   I'm only on page 126.</p>
<p>However, pages 154-213 are based on our paper "Coarse-graining open Markov processes", and I carefully worked over every sentence of that, so that part should go pretty quick - only the introduction had to be tweaked.</p>
<p>Pages 225-256 are definitions, and I've put some time already into fixing up those.</p>
<p>So, I think the end is in sight!</p>
<p>I just finished going through the section "structured vs. decorated cospans", where he lays out the general theory connecting these two approaches - joint work with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276985">@Christina Vasilakopoulou</span> and me!   So, going through this section counts as progress toward finishing our paper on that stuff.</p>

<p>Are you still moved by the stuff Eliezer Yudkowsky talked to you about in TWF#313? You expressed concern in those couple of blog posts that "all these people who care about the future seem to be talking only to like minded folk rather than each other" (paraphrased, sorry), but I think the effective altruism movement has now marshalled a large number of them together.</p>
<p>Do you count yourself among them? Are you sympathetic to their views? </p>

<p>I quit <em>This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics</em> in August 2010 when I went to Singapore, quit work on mathematical physics, and started working on environmental issues.    I changed the title to <em>This Week's Finds</em> and wrote 19 more issues that focused on environmental issues.   That took me up to April 2012.  Then I came back to U.C. Riverside and got a bunch of grad students, and decided this sort of format wasn't right for what I was doing at the time - which was trying to develop "network theory", not explain math to people.</p>

<p>Yes, I felt I'd been frittering away my life with beautiful abstract mathematics and theoretical physics ignoring the really important emergency we're all in.   There's something addictive about mathematics and theoretical physics, at least for me: the concepts that show up are so intriguing and so absorbing.  People who get pulled into these subjects - like me - tend to think they're very important and lose sight of other things.   At the time I was reacting against a lifetime of this.</p>

<p>That was around 2010, when I went to Singapore and quit working on n-categories, which were becoming a very complicated and absorbing subject.</p>
<p>Now I feel a bit different.  I've quit trying to be an expert on n-categories, but I have not been able to break my addiction to mathematics, and nowadays I'm less optimistic about my ability to do anything that has a big practical impact.</p>

<p>Makes me wonder which people in the history did very abstract math and then found a way to turn it to practice. <br>
Maybe von Neumann comes to mind. He's a bit of a foggy case to me, because on the one hand he did extremely abstract stuff early on - like writing impactful set theory papers - but then there are also quotes of him where he talks quite in disregard of all too abstract math and symbol games.</p>

<p>An interesting chapter in history is when von Neumann was at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton, and he was trying to build a computer, and other people at the Institute were trying to get him to stop because you weren't supposed to be building big messy machines there - you were supposed to be <em>writing papers</em>.</p>

<p>In 1980, Bigelow wrote: 1950 was a year of extreme pressure for the IAS engineering group; our laboratory building was overflowing with applied scientists of various sorts, especially fluid dynamicists, meteorologists, nuclear physicists, and the like. Words like "geostrophic," "Hartree-Fock," and "WKB" were echoing up and down the hallways, and people with actual programs in their hands were going to and from Herman Goldstine's office, and on the way peeking into the machine room.... During the summer of 1951, a team of scientists from Los Alamos came and put a large thermonuclear calculation on the IAS machine; it ran for 24 hours without interruption for a period of about 60 days, many of the intermediate results being checked by duplicate runs, and throughout this period only about half a dozen errors were disclosed.</p>

<p>I remember back in December 2018 I was a juror in a case against Ford Motors, and I was working on this paper during lunch breaks.    Around this time, sitting on a bench in downtown Riversde, I decided that our "brute force, check a dozen diagrams" proof that structured cospans form a symmetric monoidal double category was too tiresome.   So I dreamt up the proof we use now.</p>

By now <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275965">@Evan Patterson</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275927">@James Fairbanks</span> have already used structured cospans to create <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2020/10/19/epidemiological-modeling-with-structured-cospans/">compositional models of the spread of coronavirus</a>.

<p>Please read <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2020/09/16/open-systems-a-double-categorical-perspective-part-2/">the pop explanation of the error on my blog</a> or <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/structured.pdf">the detailed explanation in Section 5 of our paper</a>.   </p>
<p>As you'll see in the pop explanation, there are basically three layers of error: 1) a problem that Brendan and I got around in the first place using the axiom of universes - which still seems unpleasant, 2) a worse problem, and 3) a really deadly problem noticed by the referee of Joe and Christina's paper.</p>

<p>There are also a couple of possible "fixes" for decorated cospans, which you'll see in the detailed explanation: 1) a "cheap fix" which unfortunately makes it impossible to point to specific vertices in an open graph, and 2) a "real fix" which uses some 2-category theory.</p>

<p>I can say this, too: the basic abstract theorems on decorated cospans are correct, but when you apply them 1) it's easy to be fooled into thinking the hypotheses hold when they don't, and 2) what they give you is sometimes not what you really want.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is hoping for to much... But can all of the examples in <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276053">@Brendan Fong</span>'s thesis be easily adapted to structured cospans?  In particular, I was thinking a lot about Lagrangian cospans before I became aware that there was some problem with them.

<p>There are lots of things going on - for example even if we limit ourselves to lowering the prices of solar and wind power and batteries, which is a small piece of the overall picture, there's a whole lot of science and engineering involved.   </p>
<p>But what can mathematicians, especially category theorists, do?</p>
<p>One thing is to develop more math needed for the "smart grid":</p>
<ul>
<li>John S. Nolan, Blake S. Pollard, Spencer Breiner, Dhananjay Anand and Eswaran Subrahmanian, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06833">Compositional models of power systems</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="278008">@Spencer Breiner</span> could say more about where this is going... not just with the smart grid but design in general.  My student <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275914">@Joe Moeller</span> is going to be working with him at the National Institute of Standards and Technology.</p>
<p>I think category theory will be important in making "systems thinking" more precise and powerful:</p>
<ul>
<li>Steve Easterbrook, <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sme/papers/2014/Easterbrook-ICT4S-2014.pdf">From computational thinking to systems thinking: aconceptual toolkit for sustainability computing</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, that's one thing I want to work on.</p>

<p>My life is changing now that I've finished all papers with grad students except for one!   Here's my to-do list now:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Finish "Structured versus decorated cospans" with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276972">@Kenny</span>  and @<strong>Christina V</strong> .    Submitted to the arXiv and <em>Transactions of the AMS</em>, but Kenny and I are still writing up all details of the proofs of two theorems, which involve lots of big commutative diagrams.  We're meeting once a week on Mondays at 11 to work on that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Submit LaTeX of "Open systems in classical mechanics" to <em>Journal of Mathematical Physics</em>, who accepted this paper with David Weisbart and Adam Yassine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Work on "Schur functors" with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275914">@Joe Moeller</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277611">@Todd Trimble</span>.  Stalled, but soon to be revived.   It's about 3/4 done.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prepare a talk for Friday  February 5, 2021 on "Structured versus Decorated Cospans" for the Yorkshire and Midlands Category Seminar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prepare a talk for Monday March 8, 2021 at the Zurich Theoretical Physics Colloquium, perhaps called "Theoretical Physics in the 21st Century", as part of their Sustainability Week.    The idea is to talk about the most exciting areas in physics... but with an emphasis on what physicists can do to save the planet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prepare a talk  for Thursday March 18, 2021 for the Topos Institute seminar.   Maybe something similar to 4. but with applied category theory instead of physics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prepare a talk on octonions and the Standard Model for Kirill Krasnov's workshop on this seminar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write an article on condensed matter physics for <em>Nautilus</em> magazine.</p>
</li>

<p>I'd say that even if that were true, that's not what matters. At the rate that research gets done, it can be hard for anyone (even yourself) to keep track of the bigger picture of what you're aiming to achieve, and to really appreciate all of the things you've got going on.  Most days in research it can feel like you're just “[trying] really hard to finish the big proof in the paper [you're] currently writing”, or even something more mundane than that. Not all of us can write as prolifically as <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span>, but I feel we could certainly add something to the atmosphere here by not only hearing about things when they're finished, but also having some anticipation regarding projects which are still in the works.</p>

<p>These aren't research promises or proposals. No one will hold you to account if you don't deliver the stuff you said you might work on. It's just an extra piece of the experience of research that might be improved by its sharing with the community.</p>

<p><em>All</em> other people's work?  So you think you're working on the least interesting and important topics of everyone in the world?   If so, why are you doing that?</p>
<p><em>Some</em> other people's work?  So the existence of some people doing something more interesting and important makes you unwilling to talk about yours?  That seems like quite a high standard to hold yourself to... like the composer who did not release his compositions because he knew Brahms and Wagner.  (I forget his name.)</p>
<p>First of all, I know a bit about your work, and it seems interesting and important.    Second of all, and more importantly, I have a lot of trouble understanding people who aren't eager to talk about their work.  I work on things that seem fun and interesting, so naturally - well, so it seems to me, but apparently it's not so natural - I want to talk about these things, just to let other people share my pleasure.  It's like if you take a bite of a great cake at a restaurant you say "yum!  this tastes sort of like strawberry, but also..."</p>
<p>Of course it takes longer than saying "yum".  I guess one excuse I <em>can</em> imagine for not wanting to talk about one's work is "I'm having so much fun working on this that I don't want to stop and take the time to bring other people up to speed".</p>

<p>I do suspect, though, that the kinds of people who are interested in letting the world know what they're working on now are going to be mostly the same kinds of people who do things like write regular blog entries and edit the nLab.  I know I'm a person like that, and I know a lot of people aren't.  I've never really figured out exactly what the difference is, but in my experience trying to convince someone to "become" a person like that is kind of like trying to convince an introvert (like me) that they would be happier if they went to more parties.</p>

<p>Oh, I like talking about it, but in my experience people are usually rather nonplussed, since I seem to be falling in the gap between category theory proper and other fields. This is probably a good thing, but it means it seems hard to get serious feedback. And the geographical isolation doesn't help.</p>

<p>more importantly, I have a lot of trouble understanding people who aren't eager to talk about their work.  I work on things that seem fun and interesting, so naturally - well, so it seems to me, but apparently, it's not so natural - I want to talk about these things, just to let other people share my pleasure.  It's like if you take a bite of a great cake at a restaurant you say "yum!  this tastes sort of like strawberry, but also..."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But you must have thought about people like Newton, or Gauss, or Perlman. They had no need to tell anyone. For many people, math is not a social process. It is a conversation with god. With Pythagorean god. Why does the sun rise every day. Why do the planets swipe the same areas, and don't move on the spheres circumscribed over the platonic solids? Someone wants to pay money for a law of nature. Or they want an interview. It is so needlessly distracting...</p>
<p>But such people also don't like strawberies I guess.</p>

<p>I eventually remembered that some people have more fun just <em>doing</em> math:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I guess one excuse I can imagine for not wanting to talk about one's work is "I'm having so much fun working on this that I don't want to stop and take the time to bring other people up to speed".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And such people don't all need to be as good as Newton, Gauss or Perelman!</p>

<p>The (coloured/typed) operad whose category of algebras is equivalent to the category of uncoloured operads is defined in Higher-Dimensional Algebra III: n-Categories and the Algebra of Opetopes, Section 3.1. Was this operad known before this paper?</p>
