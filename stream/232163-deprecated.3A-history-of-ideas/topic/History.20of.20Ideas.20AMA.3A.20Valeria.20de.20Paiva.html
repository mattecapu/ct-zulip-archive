<p>hey Rongmin, thanks for the nice message! feel free to ask. I've given several talks about the chops-and-changes of my career, the best one perhaps in the mentoring workshop at LICS2017 <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/valeria.depaiva/weapons-of-math-construction">https://www.slideshare.net/valeria.depaiva/weapons-of-math-construction</a>. but slides mostly don't have the narration of the story, so feel free to ask!</p>

<p>well, I had done a master thesis in Algebra, (normed algebras, Hurwitz-Radon theorem) and I wanted to do something that was related to Computing, something that you could explain to your friends, something related to logic and mathematics. I had vaguely heard about toposes in the Handbook of Mathematical Logic. so I wrote to Robin Gandy, as a logician in Oxford and asked if he could be my supervisor, if I managed to get the money to attend Oxford. He wrote back a lovely hand-written letter saying he was about to retire in two years, so was not accepting new students and hence maybe I should go to  Cambridge instead, and work with his ex-student, Martin Hyland.  Robin died in 1995 and I wish I had been more confident to talk to him more before that. but I'm pleased to say that I managed to thank him for sending me to Martin, who is simply fantastic!</p>

<p>Back when I was in Adelaide doing my PhD, I used to know someone who was doing applied maths, but had also volunteered extensively with Engineers Without Borders. I'd never really felt that way about engineers, but as my research topic got more and more esoteric, it did start to feel more and more lonely.</p>

<p>I got to Cambridge in 1984 and did the dreadful Part III of the Mathematical Tripos. (another messing up on my part, as I had hoped that I would not have to do qualifying exams in England, boy, how wrong I was!) Even Hardy thought PArt III was  ghastly.</p>

<p>oh cool, I almost missed this! When Dana Scott was visiting Cambridge, Martin thought he might as well give me a problem to work on, so we had one of our fun cake-and-tea meetings, with Dana, Pino Rosolini, Edmund Robinson.  Martin described this category and asked me to prove that it was cartesian closed (like good type-theoretical cats ought to be). I tried, and tried, and finally had to come to Martin and say: sorry the best I can do is to prove it's monoidal closed. it has a tensor and internal-hom and the adjunction works. but the tensor is not a product! instead of being disappointed Martin looked and said, ah, I think Girard has been saying interesting things about situations like this. let us check it out! then when we went to<br>
Categories in Computer Science and Logic: Proceedings of the AMS-IMS-SIAM Joint Summer Research Conference Held June 14-20, 1987 in Boulder, CO, Robert Seely was very generous and offered me his slot in the program to talk about this model of Linear Logic!</p>

<p>yep, there were several courses of "Category Theory" in Part III. A bit like the "Homological Algebra" you've mentioned, they'd lecture on different subjects, under the same title. I had the serious difficulty of not speaking English very well. I had been planning (until I got Gandy's letter) to go to Paris, so I could read English, no problem, but understanding it was a different story. the situation was so bad that I thought the acronym TFAE (the following are equivalent) were the initials of some mathematicians and I thought oh my these guys are everywhere! The French red tape was slow, so I only got my acceptance from Paris 7 when I was already sitting in one of the Mill Lane Lecture rooms</p>

<p>I've heard about Part III and gotten the idea that this is where Cambridge mathematicians actually learn a lot of stuff.  My student Aaron Lauda - an <em>undergrad</em> student of mine at U.C. Riverside - went to Cambridge for grad school to study with Hyland, and I think he took Part III and immersed himself in lots of courses.</p>

<p>I think Martin was thinking of internal versions of implications. Because there is Phil Scott's The ``Dialectica” Interpretation and Categories Zeitschrift fur mathematische Logik und Grundlagen der Mathematik 24 (31-36):553-575 (1978). but this is purely syntactic, it's not Proof Theory in the Abstract, as in Martin's 2004 article for Troelstra's fest. what's exciting about dialectica categories is that all the action happens in the morphisms themselves.</p>

<p>hey, so sorry I was making dinner, eating and drinking, and only saw this now. Sure! talking about dialectica cats is something I never get tired of. I am giving a purely mathematical talk, just going over definitions and theorems to Andres Villaveces undergrad students on the 8th june. but chatting about it is much much more fun.<br>
 there are by now several variations on the cats, but originally there were two classes DC and GC (where C a cartesian closed cat with some extra strux). DC was the original Martin suggestion (based on Goedel's interpretation of the implication) and when I presented it in Boulder, Girard suggested the categories GC, where the G is for him. both DC and GC have the same objects triples (U, X, alpha), where alpha is a relation between U and X. the important thing is (as usual) the morphisms. between (U, X, alpha) and (V, Y, beta), we have a pair of maps f:U--&gt;V and F:Y--&gt;X satisfying a logical condition (if alpha(u, Fy) then beta(fu,y)).<br>
 Now it is hard to say what's the key idea behind these definitions, because it depends on your perspective. but let me try this one on you: it's a model construction for several logics (ILL, CLL, syntactic calculus,IL): what makes it interesting is the feeling that the left-hand side of the maps is like proving a theorem, while the right-handed side is like trying to refute the theorem. So it is like a superpower game: you don't go through the rounds, prover and verifier lay down their full strategy and check what would've have happened, either prover wins, or they lose it--verifier wins or the game is undetermined.<br>
there is a whole different story, if you prefer to compare dialectica categories to Chu spaces, but that it's kind of written down in TAC (DIALECTICA AND CHU CONSTRUCTIONS: COUSINS?).   Ask more as questions are the best!</p>

<p>Ah so it really is related to dialog in a way (I was wondering about the use of the word Dialectica).<br>
Is it not about this time that Abramsky gave his Game Semantic analysis of Linear Logic too?  <br>
From what I understand from the above, you are looking at the whole game in one go. In the book I read recently "<a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319911489">Immanent Reasoning or Equality in Action</a>" that is considered the strategy level. Are there any other major differences? Advantages of using Dialectica over Game Semantics or Dialogical reasoning as in the book I just mentioned?</p>

<p><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectica">Dialectica</a></em> actually refers to the journal in which Gödel published his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectica_interpretation">interpretation of Heyting arithmetic</a>.

<p>yes, I say that's a strange approximation of a game, where the powerful don't have to play, they just say what they would do and everyone sees whether this means a win or not.

<p>yes, I say that's a strange approximation of a game, where the powerful don't have to play, they just say what they would do and everyone sees whether this means a win or not.

</blockquote>
<p>Right, it does sound like it's probably a different thing. GANs and reinforcement learning are iterated games, so they're dynamic in nature.</p>

<p>How did that lead to your more recent work in NLP? I know from elsewhere that there are connections, but what was the path that you took?</p>

<p>Ah so it really is related to dialog in a way (I was wondering about the use of the word Dialectica).<br>
Is it not about this time that Abramsky gave his Game Semantic analysis of Linear Logic too?  <br>
From what I understand from the above, you are looking at the whole game in one go. In the book I read recently "<a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319911489">Immanent Reasoning or Equality in Action</a>" that is considered the strategy level. Are there any other major differences? Advantages of using Dialectica over Game Semantics or Dialogical reasoning as in the book I just mentioned?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>well, as Rongmin explained the name is only about the journal. Mike Shulman finds this terrible, I think it's perfectly sensible. Goedel didn't give a name to his interpretation, people probably referred to it as the interpretation that Goedel published in Dialectica,  from there to the Dialectica interpretation is an easy step. <br>
this is long (5 years?) before Abramsky and Jagadeesan's game semantics, which was based on earlier work of Blass (in the 70s, if I remember what I read in Blass). I haven't seen the book you mentioned! but there are billions of books in games that I haven't read. I tried to write an EPSRC project to study the game aspects of Dialectica, but it was not accepted. I wish I could find it again.</p>

<p>Does anyone think about these?   I thought of this based on what you said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>hi,<br>
about </p>
<blockquote>
<p>But you really want an "if then"?   I guess so, since you said so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>yes, I do want an "if-then", not an if and only if. If you take the (adjunction) "iff" you end up with a morphism  like a Chu-morphism and eventually (depending on which calculations you want to do) you actually don't need "two-sides" of the world, only one, as by using the equality everything you do is dual.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I must be dumb, but I don't see the connection, even vaguely</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree that this is not obvious at all, but the point is that the direction forward works like many categorical models would, it satisfies the laws you'd expect, like products allow for projections, coproducts for injections,  realizability-like satisfaction of implication is ok, if you satisfy the antecedent, then you get the consequent, etc.<br>
 the right-hand side is not exactly an "op", but like it. and it's this (wrong) side of the world that enforces linearity of the constructions. so think of elements of U,V are proofs of alpha, beta <br>
and elements of X,Y as refutations of alpha,beta.  and think of the if-then condition as a lax form of the adjunction one you were expecting. the point is that when you move from the cartesian world to the monoidal world you also move from isos<br>
F(A&amp;B) = FA&amp;F(B) to lax transformations F(A)\otimes F(B)--&gt; F(A\otimes B) satisfying the required  coherence.</p>
<p>Also one think that is important is that when you transpose one object you don't get its negation, you need to negate the relation too. so the negation of (U,X, alpha) is (X,U, not alpha) and this is not like classicla negation (not not A=A) but like intuitionistic negation A |- not not A, but not vice-versa.</p>
<p>and sure about lax adjunctions, this is exactly what's happening here. the same way Street wrote his seminal paper on the  Formal theory of Monads and there were, if I remember correctly 16 possible categories of monads, depending on the directions you wanted to reverse, I think there are plenty of ways to  weaken the adjunction categories. I have not tried to do it.</p>

<p>oops, missed this one. my Master's supervisor was Prof  Duane Randall <a href="http://people.loyno.edu/~randall/#publications">http://people.loyno.edu/~randall/#publications</a>.<br>
I had done some undergrad thinking about models of growth and PDEs, which I thought were boring. Prof Randall allowed me to think about lots of things, the theorem was neat and the mathematics needed to prove it was pretty advanced (fiber bundles in Husemoller's book).  I struggled, as I wasn't sure I wanted to do mathematics. but since I had done one year of journalism, a half year  of Law and one and a half years of Physics, I thought I will just finish this and see what comes next. I  only fell in love with mathematics  long after the trauma of Part III. maybe actually only when I moved to California and had been at Xerox PARC for a few years.</p>

<p>How did that lead to your more recent work in NLP? I know from elsewhere that there are connections, but what was the path that you took?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>hey, keep missing things in this feed...<br>
well, the connection between dialectica categories and NLP is via the work on Glue Semantics. Glue is a semantic interpretation of LFG (Lexical Functional Grammar), the grammatical theory that the work on the Xerox Language Engine (XLE) is based on. <br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glue_semantics">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glue_semantics</a>. Glue uses multiplicative linear logic as its basic mechanism for composition of  meanings of bits of  sentences. so I spend one year visiting PARC, before I joined in 2000, just talking and learning about glue. When I joined it was decided that Glue was very sophisticated and that the implemented system was going to use Transfer Semantics instead,  easier and cheaper to implement. Transfer is the basis of what I am still using nowadays. if anyone feels like trying it  out, our new semantic parser system is open source and has a demo at <a href="http://lap0973.sprachwiss.uni-konstanz.de:8080/sem.mapper/">http://lap0973.sprachwiss.uni-konstanz.de:8080/sem.mapper/</a>. it's the doctoral work of Katerina Kalouli (from Konstanz, Germany) and I am extremely proud of her work. a full implementation from scratch, with different grammar theory, different parser, but a similar logic to the PARC Bridge system that I worked on.</p>

thanks for this too. I too would like to hear about dialectica categories, what they are, and what they are good for, etc. If you feel like it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>hey Joachim! assuming that you've got  what are the dialectica cats (see above or below),  two important points as far as the Dialectica and Linear Logic (LL)  connections go. the first is that since I was doing it in 1987, more or less when LL was coming up, it actually gave it LL a bit more of a pedigree, as Goedel's name is still pretty powerful and LL seemed to some people very strange then. But more importantly, Girard's coherence spaces are a collapsed model of LL, dialectica categories keep structures apart: tensor and cartesian products are distinct, not equiprovable at all! at that stage many people thought only categorical products were worth some attention and the fact that linear logic insists on monoidal closed structures and not cartesian structures was a source of disbelief. the fact that the semantic model from where Girard abstracted away his logic did not satisfy the existence of the two monoidal structures  was a minus. (even today reddit sent me a message of someone complaining how come there is a logic that is not monotonic? if a logic is not monotonic, how can it call itself logic? sigh!) but what was really neat and exciting about the first dialectica model was that I could provide a ! (an of course modality) that is co-free and that is not simply syntax in disguise.  the proof that it generates a model of IL is a single line! I could and should've have written it in my paper from Boulder 87, in generic form, as Robert Seely did. but I only wrote the version I needed, the one for my own category DC. a rookie mistake for sure!</p>

I  have only one more historical paper, Elements of categorical logic: fifty years later, V de Paiva, A Rodin, Logica Universalis 7 (3), 265-273, which counts the beginning of "categorical logic" from Bill Lawvere's seminal phd thesis written under Eilenberg in 1963. but I have many controversial opinions on the subject!</p>

<p>Am I right in thinking here that Dialectica categories (and similarly Chu spaces) are very big (informally), and when we use them to model linear logic, we actually only end up using much smaller full subcategories? I think this is part of what makes their reading unintuitive – in particular why the pairing relation feels very loose and difficult to pin to any specific idea.</p>

<p>Am I right in thinking here that Dialectica categories (and similarly Chu spaces) are very big (informally), and when we use them to model linear logic, we actually only end up using much smaller full subcategories? I think this is part of what makes their reading unintuitive – in particular why the pairing relation feels very loose and difficult to pin to any specific idea.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't understand your question.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>we actually only end up using much smaller full subcategories
</code></pre></div>


<p>I don't think so. Every object of DSets or GSets is a linear logic proposition. whether anyone needs that proposition or not. but even if this had been the case (i.e even if we only used smaller full subcategories), I wouldn't see why it would make them unintuitive. and of course, I don't think they're unintuitive.</p>
<p>as a definition they're as good or bad as any category like the comma categories or the categories of actions of a group or orbits of elements or any  category where you have objects plus some some sort of map relating them. actually they're much easier than something as simple an "automaton".</p>
<p>the only thing that is unintuitive is the attempt to add to them an a posteriori logical explanation, more than the one that they naturally have, per their structure.</p>

<p>Well, I didn't like the courses in the School of Communications at all. they were very superficial and I thought I was not learning anything. but I love the friends I made there and some I'm still in contact with.  meanwhile, I still like the stuff about Law (I have two recent papers on using AI for law and one on the works) but I thought the course was too boring, I wasn't going to be learning stuff by rota when I was 17. so I took the big examination we have in Brazil  to get into university again and moved on to Physics. but then I got very disappointed with Physics because one day they say friction is negligible, the next day is the only thing you need to consider! I didn't like that at all. and I hated that the physicists were always one semester ahead of the Calculus you were learning in school, so you had to unlearn the bad ways of the physicists, before you could really make some progress in Analysis! (yeah, I know this is not going to get me any friends in this crowd, but this was how I felt then). So I ended up doing mathematics not because I loved it, but because it was the less boring thing I tried. And I thought I'd do a phd, to travel the world, but that after that I would do something more interesting like History or Literature for a living. But as everyone around here knows, these interesting things are the hard ones, mathematics is by comparison very easy. and satisfying. your theorem might be in fashion or not, but with a bit of luck is always true, it doesn't stop being correct. and you put correct things together and they carry on being correct. they don't stop for no good reason. I love that about mathematics! and there is so much of it, so much to learn! I also love this!</p>

<p>yeah, that. I had a two-body problem. I loved my job in Birmingham, my collaborators, and the research that we were doing.<br>
But my husband commuted 3 hours  a day to Nottingham where he worked. we had two tiny ones and Xerox made him an offer that we couldn't refuse. I was foolish enough to believe that because I had spent 5 years in the Computer Lab, Cambridge as a postdoc and had a permanent position in Birmigham that I would be able to find a job in the Bay Area. But  in the Bay Area  I fell between two stools: my work in Computing was too mathematical for the guys and my mathematical work was not good enough for the mathematicians. So I pivoted, as they do here, and became an AI person. had two great mentors for that: Danny Bobrow and Ron Kaplan, my managers at PARC.</p>

<p>Basically blockchain stuff is completely decentralized, stuff like "code is law" sucks and they need to implement trustless forms of governance/law.

<p>Cool. and no, not aware of this work at all. </p>
<p>but I have a feeling we're talking at cross purposes as the work I'm referring to has to do with using NLP techniques to extract entities and relations and make middle-domain ontologies from law texts, decisions and regulations.

<p>The Web Of Nations would I think only need simple OWL ontologies, as one just wants to describe insititutions, companies, schools, ... in official registries, and relate those registries to the nations and then linke the nations in a web. </p>
<p>But once those web sites are tied to legal spaces like that one can do more interesting things. I put together <a href="https://medium.com/@bblfish/use-cases-for-the-web-of-nations-361c24d5eaee">13 use cases</a> of which the GDPR one is likely to need more deontic reasoning.  The simple ideas is that web sites could publish  machine readable GDPR policies, so that end users could set up their rules to automate the tasks of deciding when it is ok to accept a policy without always needing to ask the user to click "yes I accept your cookies". </p>
<p>So I think there are quite a few applications where one can get going without needing to do NLP on law (though that of course would be very useful too, for other applications). It would be interesting to plot out at what point one needs to go beyond simple boolean classical reasoning.</p>

<p>Thanks for the link!<br>
I came across Curry-Howard programming in Scala, where Cats folks bring it up all the time, and indeed it is part ofwhat led me to study CT. (I started reading <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=_mtnm-9KtbEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=lectures+on+the+curry+howard+isomorphism&amp;ots=FOzF0aNX3T&amp;sig=DJVhpI8DLOHTEKhJf8_KBpW6ISA#v=onepage&amp;q=lectures%20on%20the%20curry%20howard%20isomorphism&amp;f=false">Lectures on the Curry Howard Isomorphism</a> during X-mas but got sidetracked since then). But I had not seen it mentioned in the context of ontologies which is the other tool I use a lot. <br>
For the moment the best CT description of the Semantic Community Work I have found was <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275965">@Evan Patterson</span>'s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00526">Knowledge Representation in Bicategories of Relations</a> which adapts Spivak's work to Relations and so is much closer to RDF.  <br>
What I have been looking for is a way to see if one can extend RDF to something that uses some form of light weight modal logic to better deal with contexts. RDF1.1 now has contexts in the form of DataSets, but they don't I think have a semantics for it, and a modal one seemed natural to me. (I see your paper mentions modal logic too).</p>

<p>I read your two papers on constructive DL  quickly, and will need to put time aside to read the thesis. This is very helpful for me, as I have been working with untyped DLs (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/">OWL</a>)as well as with programming strongly typed programming languages. This has led me to wondering how these two fit together.  The relation to legal thinking is an extra bonus. :-)<br>
Btw. these papers don't mention category theory. I guess being constructive there is a Topos hiding there. Is there some work there that helps make the connection in an interesting way? Perhaps it is just obvious, or there is not that much gained by looking at things the CT way here?</p>

<p>Most of my papers don't mention category theory, but it's always there in the background, in the way of thinking about stuff. and it does not need to be a topos, actually most of the time it ain't one. CCCs/simply typed lambda-calculus and extensions have an awful lot of offer, both in terms of constructive modal logic, constructive hybrid logic, constructive description logics, there's lots that we haven't done yet. but yeah, I think there's always lots to be gained by looking at it the CT way. it's just that many times it puts people off, so you don't have to mention it all the time. </p>
<p>let me know if you want to discuss any of this stuff, Scheele's thesis only scratched the surface of what I wanted to do with constructive description logics. (not a criticism of his work, just that thesis are time-bound!) thanks for reading!</p>

<p>What was the idea that led to the work on Dialectica categories?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276424">@Rongmin Lu</span> , I think we stopped with the questions, but I thought I wanted to say something more, a bit  like <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span>  did. </p>
<p>so I did work on Dialectica categories for my thesis and I am still working on applications of that work, these many years later. </p>
<p>but that work moved on into a new logic FILL (full intuitionistic linear logic) and perhaps more importantly the working out the full Curry-Howard-Lambek-Tait correspondence for ILL/FILL/CLL (work with Gavin Bierman, Nick Benton, and Martin Hyland). and then because the difficulty with LL was always the modality !, that takes you back to normal  (non-linear) logic, and this modality is the same as the traditional S4 one, this led to several works on Constructive Modal Logics (and the frontiers of categorical logic).  </p>
<p>it also led, as you asked, to Natural Language semantics and the work at PARC, on the Bridge system. I've left PARC in 2008 to join the start-up, Cuil which failed 2 years later. and since then I have been working in real industry, as opposed to PARC, a research lab. I've worked both in the sweatshop kind of industry we have in here and in more refined research labs. <br>
 I always had this knack for being contrarian: my Linear Logic is different from others Linear Logic, my Linear Lambda-calculus is different from others' linear lambda-calculus, my constructive modal logic is different from (my good friend) Alex Simpson's constructive modal logic. My semantics of English is different from other categorical semantics of English you see around here.<br>
Being a contrarian is hard work, I am very grateful to you for asking the original questions!</p>

Tait</a>, who wrote a paper on <em><a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-symbolic-logic/article/intensional-interpretations-of-functionals-of-finite-type-i/9F30EA199783BD797DF6FA44525F114E">Intensional interpretations of functionals of finite type</a></em>.</p>

<p>Can you explain what the "Tait" is in Curry-Howard-Lambek-Tait?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely! Curry-Howard says that types correspond to propositions and terms to proofs of these propositions in ND. Lambek/Lawvere  then adds that types correspond to objects in appropriate classes of categories and terms correspond to morphisms in these appropriate categories. <br>
Tait (with this reducibility method)  is the one who got the most important bit:  that convertibility of lambda-terms really corresponds to simplifying the composition of morphisms, the "engine" of the correspondence, perhaps. check for instance <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Extending-the-Curry-Howard-Interpretation-to-and-Gabbay-Queiroz/a5652d3ba731c60321bf5ee799bdeee5b4e70cbc">https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Extending-the-Curry-Howard-Interpretation-to-and-Gabbay-Queiroz/a5652d3ba731c60321bf5ee799bdeee5b4e70cbc</a></p>

<p>Hmm, it's not hard to tell the difference. it's hard to get jobs on refined research labs.  in this industry we live for the stock changes every quarter,  when stock tanks, the first thing to go is any kind of development, let alone research.</p>
