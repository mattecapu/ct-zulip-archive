<p>CT was obviously developed in the context of algebraic topology. When did people start to realize that it could be used to think about computation?</p>

<p>I don't have a definitive answer, but the relationship between computation and topology goes pretty far back. Like, Scott's "Continuous Lattices" is already talking about topological models of the lambda calculus in 1972, it seems.</p>

<p>That's a nice history. I'm not sure why I didn't think of Lambek, who made the connection between logic and category theory in three volumes of <em>Deductive Systems and Categories</em>, starting from 1968.</p>

<p>Also relevant, Lambek's work on coherence theorems for categories. He reduced it to proof theory, and so uncovered the relationship between the two. In the 70s he realized the close connection between lambda calculi and CCC. The rest is history.<br>
Btw I think he was the first on this path. Here's the first paper of his on this theme:</p>

<p>The Deductive Systems and Categories papers are hugely important in my opinion. I would prefer to say, instead of reducing coherence theorems to proof theory, that he adapted and expanded proof theory to the proof-relevant context of closed categories. At any rate, I found his account much more intuitive and easier to understand than Kelly and Mac Lane's Coherence in Closed Categories (which may have been written partly to explain what Lambek was up to).</p>

<p>I am of course in favour of discussions although I don't have concrete results to present yet. I probably also won't be able to dedicate as much time as I would like to this forum for a while. That being said, I have a number of ideas &amp; projects I'm working on (as alluded to in my intro) and I intend to discuss them here (and elsewhere) with you all before long. So if a neuro stream appears, I'll pay attention and do my best to contribute when I can.</p>

<p>Zulip has an autocomplete feature that interferes with this. When the cursor encounters three left quotes preceding it, the autocomplete pops up a dialog for you to fill in the "quote" bit, but it also eats up some text if you let it autocomplete for you under certain circumstances. So that happened when Valeria quoted my comment, and then that got quoted as well, compounding the syntax error.</p>

<p>I spent some time trying to figure out what shifted Eilenberg, not just to change the field, but to change it from a place where he built a mountain, to this work which is basically a misunderstanding of what computation is about. Imagining that computation will benefit from wrestling state machines into algebraic signatures. So now if you look around you, Eilenberg's simplicial this and singular that is in everything (including things that he wouldn't dreamt of) while the whole work on automata is of no consequence whatsoever. He didn't notice complexity, he didn't notice programming, he didn't notice algorithmic information. There were lots of exciting math threads, but he wasn't looking for them.   I know that he didn't like how things were getting "complicated for their own sake". Is that why he went into an area where he thought he would find simplicity?</p>

<p>I'm no Eilenberg, but I understand the impulse to get away from a subject that lots of smart people are piling on to and switching to something few people are thinking about.  That's why I quit working on n-categories and started thinking about applications of categories to electrical circuits and chemistry.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you're working away on some obscure corner of mathematics and all of a sudden it catches on, it can be really annoying.  You can either work harder and harder to stay ahead of the pack, or sink from being a pioneer to being just one of the crowd, or become an"organizer" who runs conferences, has grad students, and serves as a kind of social hub.... or you can <em>get out</em>.</p>

My old adviser worked in something close to IKKT matrix models and at one point he complained that apart from some Japanese folks, nobody would really be thinking much about their work, or aid developing it. I have to say that I found the whole situation pretty sad and it was one of the reasons I went to the DLR ("NASA" in Germany) after my more academic work.</p>

<p>People cite a lot in CS. 5000 citations in almost 50 years is not a lot. Hopcroft and Ullman's automata book is at 20,000. Milners CCS which is some 20 years younger is at 12,000. It probably woulnd't be fair to bring up algorithmics book. But I don't suppose you really want to conflate conceptual consequences of a theory with how many people like it. Almost any book, say, about model checking has more than 50,000 citations. Not textbooks.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I am not good at finding historic information, but I talked to Eilenberg a bit back in Como and in Louvain-la-Neuve; or more precisely, he talked to me, apparently because I physically reminded him of Grothendieck. I was trying to understand his motivations from those conversatins. I have been trying to connect the dots for many years. He was annoyed with how things were going in every possible abstract direction. MacLane was very annoyed that mathematicians were publishing papers in CS, in what seemed like shallow problems. One hypothesis that I have is that Eilenberg was trying to make CS into a decent part of algebra. The influence of Lawvere's very simplistic but spectacularly consequential observations were also a confusing influence. It seemed like everything should be expressed in very simple axioms, orelse it will explode in SGA style... But this is just my impression. </p>
<p>Another hypothesis is that hugely successful theories leave people under the impression that all theories must be in that shape. It happened to Einstein. It happened to von Neumann. It takes being a Goedel or a Turing to not be influenced by what worked yesterday, and look at every new problem in a new light.</p>
<p>Sorry, I am rambling. I cannot say that I understand these things. But they are sort of related with what is it that we do when we do math.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="294557">@dusko</span> - Interesting.  I also think that what famous people do for their "second act" will often not be as good as what they did in their first act.  It was, after all, their first act that made them famous.  Sting by himself wasn't as good as The Police, and Paul McCartney's stuff with Wings was not nearly as good as the Beatles.  But they <em>had to</em> cut loose, for reasons like those I mentioned.  If you keep doing the same thing you feel pressured to keep out-doing yourself: "just the same as before, only better".   Also, personal frictions may cause teams to break up.  I have no idea if Eilenberg got tired of working with Mac Lane; that might have played a role, or it might have had nothing to do with his change of direction.</p>

<p>This has already been answered previously, but really, I'm wondering if you're asking in good faith. (Though there might be a culture shock: as an undergrad, I learned about syntactic monoids in my theory of computation course, so this stuff always seemed like a classical TCS topic.) I mean, look at the program of any recent edition of LICS or ICALP, and you will find several papers using the tools of algebraic language theory.</p>
<p>I'm not even going to argue about "applications to software testing". This stuff is super interesting as pure math. Do you believe finite group theory is "of any consequence", intellectually speaking? Would it still be relevant if there were no applications to e.g. chemistry? If so, then why would finite monoids be fundamentally less worthy than finite groups?</p>

<p>A field where a lot of stuff is computable, too: for instance the decidability of Monadic Second-Order Logic over various infinitary structures is among the most powerful decidability results that exist in the theory of formal verification (but to be fair it doesn't always lead to practically tractable algorithms). Algebraic approaches have something to say about this, for instance they can give a proof of McNaughton's determinization theorem, and the latter is useful to synthesize stream transducers from MSO specifications (the so-called Church synthesis problem - is Alonzo Church also one of those guys whose later work is of no consequence?).</p>

<p>I think the suggestion was more that the work Eilenberg did ended up not having much impact on automata theory. My sense was that it might have, but honestly I don't know the field enough to say! Also, it may be that it should have, but did not, or it may be that it did have such an impact, but only indirectly or... etc.</p>

<p>Well, for example Eilenberg's variety theorem is pretty important in justifying the idea of algebraic language theory: it tells you that well-behaved classes of finite monoids correspond exactly to well-behaved subclasses of regular languages.</p>

<p>I interpreted (perhaps wrongly) <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="294557">@dusko</span> as saying more generally that using algebraic tools in automata theory was not interesting. That is of course a subjective judgment, but at least there are enough people who find that interesting to keep the field active to this day.</p>

<p>I sensed another thing at work: Eilenberg's work in algebraic topology was <em>so incredibly important</em> to mathematics that one might hope his work in computer science would be <em>equally</em> important.  I don't think it's <em>that</em> important.</p>

<p>But I don't think we should be surprised, after someone does something truly amazing, that the next thing they do is less amazing.</p>

<p>If you were wrong in your interpretation, I don't want to be right. Maybe it was meant as a humorous dig, but I'd go with John by saying that just because Eilenberg struck out with category theory doesn't mean that he should be expected to revolutionise automata theory. And I do think that applications to software testing <em>are</em> significant and often overlooked.</p>
