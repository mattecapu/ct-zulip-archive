<p>I first arrived in Brazil -- Recife (Pernambuco) -- in 1992, as a kind of exchange student, to take a couple of courses for my masters degree back in Aarhus. One was a course on schemes (Hartshorne Ch.2, page for page) and one was on elliptic curves (following Silverman). This was a wonderful experience. Brazil is a fantastic country -- nice people, rich culture, good weather. The courses were also very good, in the spirit of the people: hard-working without being hurried.</p>

<p>I also got a taste for being a foreigner. It's a great excuse for being different. Instead of people thinking I was weird, they could attribute it to the fact that I was a foreigner. And then I picked up some social skills. I also learned not to wear socks in my sandals, not to cross my legs like a woman, and not to drink beer directly from the bottle.</p>

<p>Back in Denmark, I passed the exams for the courses, and then I had to write my masters dissertation, which was supposed to be about flag manifolds in characteristic p. In 94 I went back to Recife to write the dissertation. I finished it in 96. (I never got to the flag manifolds, only complete intersections.) It took a bit longer than expected, because meanwhile I met the girl who is now my wife -- actually my first girlfriend. That was quite distracting.</p>

<p>I applied for a PhD in Aarhus, but I was not accepted :-( I suppose they were a bit worried it had taken me three years to write my masters thesis. But then luckily I got a grant in Recife to work with Israel Vainsencher. It was the same project I had presented in Aarhus, on enumerative geometry via quantum cohomology. I had mostly copied it from the description of the special programme that had just run at the Mittag-Leffler Institute, where some of my friends had participated.</p>

<p>Yes, Australia is a fantastic country too, for many of the same reasons. I spent some time in Sydney when I was a boy, and it had a great impact on me, to see something different from Denmark. It was a nice experience to live in a young and vibrant country full of immigrants.</p>

<p>Math interlude -- <em>Kontsevich's formula for rational plane curves</em>:</p>
<p>An algebraic curve is rational if it can be parametrised by the projective line. Enumerative geometry is the art of counting how many geometric objects (often curves) satisfy certain conditions. The enumerative geometry of rational curves goes back to Antiquity: given 2 points in the plane, there is 1 line (= degree-1 rational curve) that passes through them. Apollonius essentially showed that there is 1 conic (= degree-2 rational curve) that passes through 5 given points. In degree 3: Steiner (1848) computed that 12 rational plane cubics pass through 8 points, and finally, (the great Danish mathematician) Zeuthen (1873) computed the number 620 of rational plane quartics through 11 points.</p>
<p>Then a century passed.</p>
<p>With modern intersection theory à la Fulton (1980s), the results of Zeuthen could finally be verified to modern standards of rigour, and the next number: 87304 rational quintics through 14 points, was computed in 1993 by my thesis advisor Israel Vainsencher, as a byproduct of other investigations.</p>
<p>Then in 1994, Kontsevich found a marvelous recursive formula solving the general case (of rational degree-d curves through 3d-1 points). The formula dropped out 'by accident' from ideas from string theory, and in particular the notion of quantum cohomology. Furthermore, the formula is an instance of the associative law for the product in the quantum cohomology ring! Could it be more beautiful? A century-old problem is given a solution expressed as associativity, arguable one of the most basic notions in mathematics.</p>

<p>In my thesis I generalised Kontsevich's formula by constructing a certain tangency quantum cohomology ring, whose associativity solves the characteristic-number problem. That is, counting rational curves subject to tangency conditions, such as the famous 3264 conics tangent to 5 given conics. (Recursions for the characteristic numbers had already been found by Pandharipande, Vakil, Ernström, and Kennedy. So my contribution was mainly a conceptual one.)</p>

<p>I started to drift away from algebraic geometry shortly after my PhD. I came to Stockholm for my first postdoc to work with Lars Ernström, who had been interested in my thesis. But a few weeks after my arrival he quit maths to work for Ericsson! That was in 2000, and Ericsson was one of the biggest companies in the world, and everybody in Stockholm had a mobile phone.</p>
<p>But then I began to talk with Dan Laksov, Michael Shapiro, Carel Faber, Helge Måkestad, and Mats Boij. We started a reading seminar on topological quantum field theories, reading Atiyah, Dubrovin, and Abrams. I also suggested we should read Baez-Dolan, but that was considered too far out!</p>
<p>I actually worked full time on the seminar, and really made an effort to iron out everything. I was very much inspired by This Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics. A year later I had the opportunity to give a not-quite-mini course on this material at a summer school back in Recife, and I wrote it all up into a book. I think at this point I could not longer hide my categorical bias :-)</p>

<p>Then in 1994, Kontsevich found a marvelous recursive formula solving the general case (of rational degree-d curves through 3d-1 points). The formula dropped out 'by accident' from ideas from string theory, and in particular the notion of quantum cohomology. Furthermore, the formula is an instance of the associative law for the product in the quantum cohomology ring! Could it be more beautiful? A century-old problem is given a solution expressed as associativity, arguable one of the most basic notions in mathematics.</p>

<p>WOW!!! Beautiful! and very surprising.</p>

<p>Of course! But at this point in life I was more concerned with <em>not</em> becoming a category theorist! (Actually previously I had also tried to avoid becoming a mathematician, but that did not work out.)</p>
<p>But of course my father had a big influence on my maths, even in my thesis work. When I learned algebraic geometry, he told me a lot about representable functors and the big Zariski site, and the importance of nilpotent elements, and Grothendieck fibrations, and so on. And when I studied Riemannian geometry I also got a good dose of synthetic differential geometry. And countless small things and viewpoints I was maybe not even aware of at the time. Probably even just the taste for abstract mathematics. All that only really sunk in much later.</p>

<p>oh well, I never managed to get my kids interested in mathematical ideas.</p>
<p>and yes, I do count your dad (Anders Kock, if people don't know) as a friend. did you know that he once spend the weekend at my house in Cambridge? for a PSSL, we messed up the reservations or ran out of rooms or something and Anders stayed at my place. I hope this was at the very nice house (in 4 years I had to move 4 times, so the houses get a bit jumbled up in my memory). and yes someone should write up the story of the PSSL which together with TAC is one of things category theorists should be proud of.</p>

<p>I was a postdoc with André Joyal in Montreal in 2003-2004. Up to the summer 2004 we worked on weak units and the Simpson conjecture.</p>
<p>Then in July 2004, we both participated in the conference in Minneapolis on n-categories, organised by John Baez and Peter May. A fantastic conference, very inspiring. Actually it was more than a conference -- it was a work camp: talks started at 8 o'clock in the morning; dinner was just a sandwich during the Russian-style evening talks! Very intense -- it was hard to find time to go to Dinky Town and drink pitchers.</p>

Especially Gian-Franco had many crazy ideas we tried to formalise.</p>
<p>After the conference, Michael spent two weeks in Montreal, and we could not stop thinking about opetopes. At some point, André pulled polynomial functors out of his hat: a combinatorial framework for certain nice operads -- including all the operads resulting from the iterated Baez-Dolan construction. Polynomial functors are sums of representables. The representing data is a configuration of sets <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>I</mi><mo>←</mo><mi>E</mi><mo>→</mo><mi>B</mi><mo>→</mo><mi>J</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">I \leftarrow E \to B \to J</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault" style="margin-right:0.07847em;">I</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mrel">←</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault" style="margin-right:0.05764em;">E</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mrel">→</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault" style="margin-right:0.05017em;">B</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mrel">→</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault" style="margin-right:0.09618em;">J</span></span></span></span>, and everything becomes very combinatorial.

<p>Between August and November, André guided me through the basic theory of polynomial functors. I was completely absorbed. It is a beautiful theory. At first it is a cute categorical version of some elementary algebra. Soon it becomes a general toolbox for substitution and induction, intimately related with dependent type theory. Very conveniently, Nicola Gambino came visiting in October, and he was already working with polynomial functors in connection with type theory. Then in November 2004 I moved to Barcelona.</p>
<p>I think André was happy someone could take up the theory, and he invested some time in setting it in the right direction. He did not have time to develop it himself, as he was busy with the grand project of quasi-categories. I feel very privileged for having been there just at the right time. For the past 16 years, polynomial functors have been a main theme in my work.</p>

<p>It took three more years before we finished the opetope project, <em>Polynomial functors and opetopes</em> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1033">https://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1033</a>. Meanwhile, Nicola and I began to write what we intended to be a kind of foundational paper on <em>Polynomial functors and polynomial monads</em> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0906.4931">https://arxiv.org/abs/0906.4931</a>, incorporating also a lot of stuff from parallel developments in computer science (where polynomial functors had been studied under the name 'containers').</p>

<p>John wrote about the conference <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/IMA/">here</a>, which also has some nice photos. Sadly, the conference website itself is down. <em><a href="https://ncatlab.org/johnbaez/show/Towards+Higher+Categories">Towards Higher Categories</a></em> is a book associated with that conference, but it is not a proceedings.</p>
