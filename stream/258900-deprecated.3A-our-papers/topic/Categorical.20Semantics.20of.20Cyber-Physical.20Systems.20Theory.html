<p>Our paper (with C. Vasilakopoulou and C. Fleming) has been accepted in ACM Transactions on Cyber-Physical Systems – essentially a top venue in the area. Here is the paper with the minor revisions we just submitted <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.08003.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.08003.pdf</a></p>
<p>I was rather surprised; a lot of people kept cautioning me that category theory might be a hard sell (and my paper with Fabrizio kinda showed me that but I believe it was the wrong venue for the work).</p>
<p>We didn't have any problems with this one, reviews were useful and fair and they seemed interested in the categorical content especially as applied to system design and analysis. I say that to promote that maybe there is an unreasonable fear (if it even exists and is not in my head) of publishing in domain specific venues with category theory as a central concept.</p>

<p>The paper is using categorical results to construct new developments in the field of CPS. There is also some new stuff in regards to contracts but we use several results (as cited) to create something new for the modeling of those systems. I am not sure if that answers your question. As an engineer these applications are new as well in the sense that linear temporal logic existed way before robotics and controls people used it and it was a rather well developed theory but it had not been fully applied in control and robotics until roboticists and controls people did some concrete applications in a problem that was relevant to that field. Let me know if that answers your question, if not I would like to clarify to the best way possible.</p>

<p>Thanks, I fixed this for the final draft. Although I kept \section as the later one and \subsection as the former one. I am not sure what correct typographic style indicates here.</p>

<p>I  don't think there's any one correct style here, but I think it's good to have section and subsection titles be capitalized in a consistent way; otherwise it feels discordant (even, I claim, to people who don't <em>consciously</em> notice).</p>

<p>If you look at all my papers it's the common example, because I worked in the VCU UAV lab as an undergraduate and it's the system I know bottom to top :) it has nothing to do with my funding</p>

<p>well, i just looked up the paper, and my sense is that it might not necessarily have to do with category theory, but with the fact that it is a very good, concrete, carefully written paper. and there is also a great deal of randomness, so sometimes by accident it happens that good papers get accepted.</p>
