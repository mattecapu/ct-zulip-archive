<p>Hello everyone! Me, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="282822">@fosco</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="281862">@Daniele Palombi</span> have a new paper out. This is related to the paper about mana-nets that we released last week (discussed here: #<strong>#</strong>practice: our papers&gt;Nets with Mana: A Framework for Chemical Reaction Modelling** ),  and it's part of a bigger effort in categorizing extensions of Petri nets using fibrations and lax functors.</p>
<p>You can find the arXiv here: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09100">https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09100</a><br>
If you don't like to read, I've also made a video presentation here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv4dyTNgz60">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mv4dyTNgz60</a></p>

Any feedback is appreciated! By the way, next week we will release yet another paper about hierarchic nets, so if Petri nets are your thing, stay tuned! <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span></p>

<p>Cool.  Btw in English they're called "hierarchical" Petri nets.   The word "hiearchical" is used much more than "hierarchic" (which I don't remember ever hearing).</p>
<p>Let's see:</p>

"hierarchic Petri net": 77 Google hits</p>

<p>Jade and Joe were on the right track, and there's still <em>a lot</em> of work to do. The narrative that we are pushing in our papers is that:</p>

<p>This is a very open and difficult question to answer, and it would definitely benefit if different groups of people would work on it.

<p>The reason for this is exactly that these functors correspond to slice categories via a categorical equivalence. In taste, it is also similar to what we do in out paper with Jade and Mike, when we switch from the profunctor perspective to the groupoid perspective.</p>

<p>If you don’t mind me asking, what are the big open questions or lines of development when it comes to Petri nets and category theory?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are no "big" open questions. But since the 90s it turned out that categories were good to talk about ways in which a Petri net can run. There are 3 ways we can make this better:</p>
<ul>
<li>Categories are good to compose things. We can generalize in this direction and obtain a way to compose Petri nets. This is what John has been doing with open Petri nets. There are also other notions of composing nets that exploit categorical ideas.</li>
<li>We can better realize the correspondence between categories and nets. The mantra of the 90s approach was that categories of nets and categories of categories are adjoint in some way. This can be made more precise by refining your definition of net or the one of the category you use to model the executions. This is what John, me, Jade and Mike have been doing in our last paper, for instance.</li>
<li>The last way of employing cats is that there are countless flavors of Petri nets around (nets, guarded nets, timed nets, hierarchical nets, nets with inhibitor arcs, ...). Many of them have never been modelled categorically. This is what me, Fosco and Daniele are tackling with our papers now. An example in this direction, but using different means was my paper with Jelle Herold about integer nets, that has been much further extended and systhematized by Jade with her "generalized Petri nets" approach. <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span></li>

<p>Too modest!  Until fairly recently one big open question was this: we knew roughly that a Petri net was a way of describing some sort of symmetric monoidal category, so there should be some left adjoint functor from some category of Petri nets to some category of symmetric monoidal categories... but how <em>exactly</em> does this work?  A lot of work was done on this, starting in 1990, but all this work had peculiarly complicated features.  Only recently was this question <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2021/01/17/categories-of-nets/">completely solved</a>.</p>

<p>But this is just the beginning: there are many variants of Petri nets, which Fabrizio just listed above, and many forms of semantics for these.   They all call out for a clear treatment, which necessarily requires category theory.</p>

<p>So, this is where I beg to differ. I think this is just one way to represent the semantics of Petri nets. For us, categorists, this is clearly the right way. But I think we still have a long way to go to prove to the traditional Petri net community that there are definite advantages with this approach. For instance, many people are perfectly happy in representing the net semantics using graphs of states. <span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span></p>

<p>At least personally, I'm interested in understanding better with category theory how Petri nets are glued together. There has been a lot of work on this already including the paper <em>Open Petri Nets</em> which I wrote with John. I'm hoping to generalize this to get a better understanding of compositionally for Petri net-like systems. I'd also like to get more practical insights about composing these systems using category theory.</p>

<p>Anyway, this just shows something we all know: behind the neat surface mathematics there are people doing their usual messy people things.   Luckily in this case nobody is unhappy (as far as I can tell), and Fabrizio and Jade and Mike and I later wrote a paper together.

<p>I don't really care who thought of it first, (and it definitely wasn't me) but I remember telling Fab about this idea at the 2nd Statebox Summit (in 2018 I think?) John had told it to me earlier. The one difference was that we were thinking about functors <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>F</mi><mo>:</mo><mi>F</mi><mi>P</mi><mo>→</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">S</mi><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">e</mi><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">t</mi></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">F: FP \to \mathsf{Set}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">F</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mrel">:</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">F</span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">P</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mrel">→</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.69444em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathsf">S</span><span class="mord mathsf">e</span><span class="mord mathsf">t</span></span></span></span></span> rather than lax functors into <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">S</mi><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">p</mi><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">a</mi><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathsf{Span}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8888799999999999em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathsf">S</span><span class="mord mathsf">p</span><span class="mord mathsf">a</span><span class="mord mathsf">n</span></span></span></span></span>. Later Joe and I figured out that you could capture colored Petri nets with guards a lot better by taking lax functors in Span. Probably Fab and David figured that out on their own as well I'm guessing.</p>

<p>I like my wording: "a Petri net is a <em>seemingly</em> simple thing" - because it comes at the start of a very intense paper examining 3 different ways to think about Petri-net-like things.</p>

<p>It's like the old physics anecdote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The version I heard is that Pauli was lecturing, and he said "this is obvious". A student raises his hand and says "sorry professor, I don't think that is obvious". Pauli stares at the board, back at the students. He thinks for a bit. He starts pacing in front of the class, thinking. He looks back at the board. Eventually he leaves the room, comes back 20 minutes later and says "I've thought about it and yes, it is obvious".</p>
