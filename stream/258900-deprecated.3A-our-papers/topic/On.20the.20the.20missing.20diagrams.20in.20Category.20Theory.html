<p>Hi all, I rewrote my paper on an extensible diagrammatic language for drawing the "missing diagrams" in CT and I would like to ask one thing here before submitting it (tomorrow!)... its abstract - below - makes a bold claim - in boldface...</p>

<p>Most texts on Category Theory are written in a very terse style, in which people pretend a) that all concepts are visualizable, and b) that the readers can reconstruct the diagrams that the authors had in mind based on only the most essential cues. As an outsider I spent years believing that the techniques for drawing diagrams were part of the oral culture of the field, and that the insiders could read texts on CT reconstructing the "missing diagrams" in them line by line and paragraph by paragraph, and drawing for each page of text a page of diagrams with all the diagrams that the authors had omitted. My belief was wrong: there are lots of conventions for drawing diagrams scattered through the literature, <strong>but that unified diagrammatic language did not exist</strong>. In this chapter I will show an attempt to reconstruct that (imaginary) language for missing diagrams: we will see an extensible diagrammatic language, called DL, that follows the conventions of the diagrams in the literature of CT whenever possible and that seems to be adequate for drawing "missing diagrams" for Category Theory. Our examples include the "missing diagrams" for adjunctions, for the Yoneda Lemma, for Kan extensions, and for geometric morphisms, and how to formalize them in Agda.</p>

<p>I consider myself an insider but I don't myself employ such a visual mode of thinking, so I never even noticed that people (or a majority, or whatever) pretend that all concepts are visualisable. (That is not say I don't use diagrams. I do – but mainly to clarify what I mean when I have lots of anonymous arrows identified primarily by their formal domain and codomain.)</p>

<p>If your claim is that a <em>formalized</em> "diagrammatic language" doesn't exist that encompasses all the sorts of diagrams that people draw, then that may be true.  But I don't think that contradicts an assertion that people can read a text on category theory and translate it into diagrams.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276777">@Mike Shulman</span>, I've met very few people who were willing to share how they drew their diagrams, and in all of the few opportunites that I had to chat with them I asked lots of questions about what each entity in their diagrams meant and how we could translate their diagrams to other languages that were more formal. I was quite inconvenient - not on purpose - and we always reached very quickly conventions that they didn't know how to explain and things that they didn't know how to formalize... and that I didn't understand.</p>

<p>I don't exactly agree in general that the answer to things not be explained clearly is more formalisation. But formalising diagrams is still a super interesting question. Sometimes <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277574">@Conor McBride</span> talks about formalising diagrams too - in his case the goal is to communicate universal properties "in their native language" to a computer. Something he emphasises is that many diagrams have a sort of "dynamics" coming from the order of quantifiers. For example the definition of a pullback comes in 5 phases: given 2 arrows there exist 2 more arrows such that for any 2 more arrows, an arrow exists, and is equal to any other given arrow</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277473">@Morgan Rogers (he/him)</span>, yes - the left half has the shape of an adjunction, the right half has the shape of the Yoneda Lemma (with a deleted node), and that whole diagram has exactly the same shape as the preceding one in the paper because it is a particular case of the preceding one. The list of conventions in section 2 includes several conventions on how diagrams with the same shape can be used.</p>

<p>Also kind of related: for a number of years I was under the impression that if you glued commutative diagrams together the resulting diagram would always be commutative. Of course, in reality there are certain topological obstructions to this. I haven't ever seen anyone ever discuss this in an introductory text or in a particularly comprehensive way. Though I admittedly haven't read Categories, Allegories and I think it might mention something about this.  (Actually, many texts don't give any definition at all for what it means for diagram to be commutative.)</p>

<p>True! That's Stokes theorem for commutative diagrams :) it only works if you around a commutative diagram. Or, in other words, if every 'irreducible' subdiagram of the glueing is commutative.</p>
