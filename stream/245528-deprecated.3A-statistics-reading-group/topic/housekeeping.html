<p>Here is the document I will review with the group at tomorrow's meeting. <a href="/user_uploads/21317/DYpJmwEinm0EHj6_hxDERozG/Abstracts-and-Notes.pdf">Abstracts-and-Notes.pdf</a> </p>
<p>It includes a digest of six papers that I have selected as candidates for our first reading. Several of the papers' authors are on here, so if anybody reads this and feels that I have done a poor job picking out the key points, please let me know.</p>

<p>I'm going to periodically update this post as I browse the papers. First, I'll write the key points and my interest. At the end, I'll chose the top 2. <br>
<strong>McCullagh.</strong> <br>
<strong>Numbers: 2, 5, 6, 11</strong><br>
Statistical model, parametrized statistical model, Bayesian model, extension of a model. <br>
I'm interested in understanding how one compiles data into a statistical model (or what statistical models are compatible with that data), and how to make inference based on that model. What is an extension of a model and in what sense does inference require a model to be extendable? My interest in the categorical aspects are towards quantum mechanical generalizations (this occurs for all papers unless otherwise specified). <br>
<strong>Morse and Sacksteder</strong><br>
<strong>Numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11</strong> yikes I'm sorry all of this sounds interesting and is written in a language familiar to me (invariants, etc). <br>
Comparing experiments and sufficiency from a categorical perspective.<br>
<strong>Simpson</strong><br>
<strong>Numbers: 5</strong><br>
I'm curious if Simpson claims that the Giry monad has a conceptual definition rather than a specific construction (probability measures on a space). <br>
<strong>Patterson</strong><br>
<strong>Numbers: 3, 5, 7</strong><br>
I have little coding experience, but if the requirements are minimal, I would be interested in picking some up for the purpose of examples. I'm thinking this could be useful in parametric Bayesian updating, which I am very interested in learning about. <br>
<strong>Perrone</strong><br>
<strong>Numbers: 3, 6, 7</strong><br>
Probability monads, convex monotone maps as lax morphisms, disintegrations<br>
My interest in this may vary, but ATM, it is more on lax affine morphisms and the section on disintegrations (for two separate projects, one on entropy and one on conditional expectations). I am curious to see how the adjunction related to the Kantorovich monad is explained in terms of Choquet theory.<br>
<strong>Fritz</strong><br>
<strong>Numbers: 4, 7, 8, 12</strong><br>
Sufficient statistics, conditional independence. <br>
I'd like to know what a statistic is, how it is related to a statistical model (from McCullagh), and what it means for such a statistic to be sufficient. I assume it means sufficient for prediction/extrapolation, so it seems also related to extendability of a model. I also want to know how much of probability and statistics can be phrased in the Markov category language (and what are their limitations).<br>
My top two choices for papers are<br>
<strong>1. Morse &amp; Sacksteder</strong><br>
<strong>2. Fritz</strong> (although I have read much of it, I think it is a good place to start)</p>

<p><strong>McCullagh</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This seems somewhat interesting as far as the philosophy of statistics is concerned and getting the fundamentals right, but it doesn't seem too connected to modelling the details of statistical inference as such otherwise.</li>
<li>3, 4, 5, 11</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Morse &amp; Sacksteder</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This seems almost identical to some of my projects, so I feel like I should have read it already, but I haven't <span aria-label="sweat smile" class="emoji emoji-1f605" role="img" title="sweat smile">:sweat_smile:</span></li>
<li>3, 4, 11</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Simpson</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Based on the abstract, I don't see anything relevant to me personally. I guess learning some very basics of Giry monad and examples of computations with it is the most interesting part to me.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Patterson</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Structuralist approach to data analysis sounds super cool, and I like the nuanced modelling of statistical theories. Chapters 3 and 4 are more interesting to me.</li>
<li>3, 5, 7, 10, 11</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Perrone</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This is also very much related to my work and interests, especially the stuff on L-ordered spaces. I didn't put it in the selection below, because I have already read parts of it and I feel like I can understand it pretty well on my own, but I am more than happy to go through it in more detail and discuss its contents.</li>
<li>2, 4, 7, 11, 17</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fritz</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This is a great paper, I have read it in great detail already, but I am happy to discuss its contents with the rest of the group.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Top papers: (1) Patterson, (2) Morse &amp; Sacksteder</strong></p>
<p>Generally, I think am actually the most interested in learning about how the categorical modelling of statistical concepts relates to the actual practice of statistics and understanding what are the main obstructions towards bringing the categorical language closer to the practice.</p>

<p>Morse 1,6 Connection of samples and experiments can we relate how human model decisions and beliefs in this same framework?<br>
Simpson 3 Sheaves come up so much would like to learn more about applied to probability.<br>
Patterson 2,3,4 10 The whole paper really. We are essentially data science experiments trying to navigate the world and update our mental models of it. Connecting the abstract categorical account with the pragmatics of dealing with data and a decision is very interesting to me to understand better.<br>
Fritz 1,4 Much of how we judge events and decide on actions is relative to a context or evidence. Applying the categorical notions to conditional probability is relevant and might provide constraints on models of behavior. <br>

<p><strong>McCullagh</strong> (5, 7): The problem of formalizing what it means for a statistical model to have a natural extension to a larger set of observational units is a good one. I'm interested in how this might be related to replicability problems in science, see e.g. this paper on the <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/jqw35">"generalizability crisis"</a>. I think that category theory should have something to say about how statistical models from different experiments are compatible with each other (or not).</p>
<p><strong>Morse and Sacksteder</strong> (10, 11, 12): I'm curious about the "complete set of invariants" for statistical isomorphism. IIRC, <a href="https://www.ams.org/books/mmono/053/">Cencov's book</a> has some material on complete sets of invariants. It would be good to understand how this all fits together.</p>
<p><strong>Simpson</strong> (1, 2, 3): I like the goal of formalizing the <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2010/01/01/254a-notes-0-a-review-of-probability-theory/">idea</a> that probabilistic concepts (unlike measure-theoretic ones) must be invariant under extension of the underlying probability space.</p>
<p><strong>Patterson</strong>: [I am the author, so I won't say anything here.]</p>
<p><strong>Perrone</strong> (10, 11, 12): I'm interested in better understanding how orders on a measurable space can be extended to metrics on the space of probability measures on that space.</p>
<p><strong>Fritz</strong>: This paper is the most comprehensive treatment of Markov categories yet written. Ch. 3-4 of my thesis build on ideas from this and other papers on categories of Markov kernels and their abstraction as Markov categories. The paper has lots of good examples and results.</p>
<p>Top papers to start with: (1) McCullagh, (2) Perrone</p>

I'm interested in how to represent statistical models algebraically for computation. This paper seems like a natural place to start.</p>

This idea of isomorphism between "statistical systems" seems like it could be useful to being able reason about relationship betwen various statistical approachs to scientific problems.</p>

<p>Patterson: 1, 3, 4, 5, 10, 11<br>
I am an applied statistician, scientist, and developer of statistical software, so this paper is the most directly relevant to me. I'm mostly interested in the algebra of statistical theories.</p>
<p>Perrone: 1<br>
The heavy categorical language is all a bit beyond my curent categorical knowledge, but I'm game to hang on for dear life and learn.</p>

This sounds _awesome_!! The zoo of examples is great, the connection to software is great - it seems to be something that might make sense to the Machine Learning people in my department. Also great that we have the author with us.</p>
<p>Perrone:<br>
Again, I am not sure what this is about.</p>

<p>McCullagh - What is a Statistical Model?<br>
    2, 3, 9,10,11, 4, 5<br>
    A categorical definition of a statistical model seems like an good first step in studying categorical statistics</p>
<p>Morse<br>
    3, 12, 1<br>
    Sounds like flow models in unsupervised learning: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBb5sSC0JoY&amp;list=PLwRJQ4m4UJjPiJP3691u-qWwPGVKzSlNP&amp;index=3">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBb5sSC0JoY&amp;list=PLwRJQ4m4UJjPiJP3691u-qWwPGVKzSlNP&amp;index=3</a></p>
<p>Simpson<br>
    1,2,3<br>
    Sheaves are cool. </p>
<p>Patterson<br>
    1,2,3,5,7,10,11<br>
    I'm curious how this relates to McCullagh's definition of a statistical model. I'm interested in the ontology.</p>
<p>Perrone<br>
    I don't understand most of these points, so can't mark the most interesting points to me.</p>
<p>Fritz<br>
    1, 7, 13<br>
    I'm interested in Markov Decision Processes, I'd like to use a categorical perspective. I am more familiar with probability than statistics.</p>

<p>Also, if anybody has additional papers that are not on the list here:<br>
<a href="https://wiki.functorialwiki.org/act/show/Statistics+reading+group">https://wiki.functorialwiki.org/act/show/Statistics+reading+group</a></p>
<p>Please post your suggestions! I want this list to be an easy go-to a resource for people looking to get into categorical statistics and probability, so the more papers the better.</p>
