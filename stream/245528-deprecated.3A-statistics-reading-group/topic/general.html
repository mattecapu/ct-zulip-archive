<p>Interesting that you would mention this right now. I'm actually sitting here working on my statement of motivation for the reading circle. I'm a bit swamped with classes for the next four weeks, but I'll probably announce the first meeting before the end of the month.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="285161">@Oliver Shetler</span> Yes. Many of these were papers mentioned during the workshop on categorical probability that we both attended. Here are some of them, not written in any particular order (Note: I don't know if I actually want to go through all of these---I am just listing ones that I believe are either interesting or important based on the discussions from the workshop). </p>
<ol>
<li>McCullagh - "What is a statistical model?"</li>

<li>Dawid - "Conditional independence in statistical theory"</li>
<li>Wald - "Contributions to the Theory of Statistical Estimation and Testing Hypotheses"</li>

Depending on how the reading group will run, it is obviously impractical to go through this many papers. This is more like a shortlist. Unfortunately, my background in statistics is very poor, which is probably why I've chosen papers that focus on my weaknesses. My highest preference is probably McCullagh's paper as a start, since it seems to explain many things from the ground up. <br>
Another one I'd recommend (it is one I have already been reading) would be Fritz - "A synthetic approach to Markov kernels, conditional independence and theorems on sufficient statistics"</li>

<p>I'm going to take a closer look at abstracts and rate each paper for its potential as educational material, rather than for other qualities. The focus should be on if it introduces important general concepts and if it has clear pedagogy. If others want to do the same, either rate the papers for educational value on a scale from 1-10 or just list the top 3-5 options in your mind.</p>

<p>I'm thinking that after McCallaugh, we should take a look at Patterson's thesis and something on Markov Categories and probability monads soon thereafter. It also seems like Jacobs has done some interesting work on parameter learning. These are just some preliminary thoughts though.</p>

<p>Since I've actually been reading Jacobs' papers, this would be excellent. I'm actually currently going through his paper on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00269">Conjugate Priors</a>, which discusses Bayesian updating and parametric Bayes (and I have actually been acquiring some questions with regards to that paper, which could form a nice discussion). <br>
I agree that one should start with things that are easier to read and address simpler ideas before moving on to more advanced topics. Personally, I can say with confidence (only based on the fact that I've read many of their papers!) that anything written by Fritz, Perrone, Fong, and Jacobs is well-written (in the sense that it is not only accessible but also precise, not overly technical, and contains examples one can check their understanding with). The top five papers I recommend (the first four are purely based on me having read parts of them and knowing that the material is solid and <em>reasonably</em> accessible) are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Perrone's PhD thesis (best introduction to monads I have ever seen, gets technical in later chapters, which is to be expected since Paolo's work is on quite general complete metric spaces, but still well-written if that's what you want to lean towards)</li>
<li>Fritz "A synthetic..." (overall good paper from start to finish that does not get too technical except in certain remarks and examples---one can go a long way by keeping in mind probabilities on finite sets)</li>
<li>Fong's thesis (overall solid and reviews a lot of the measure theory)</li>
<li>Jacobs "conjugate priors" (I forgot to put this on the list, but it should be---it is a short paper, focuses on a very narrow idea, namely updating, which is very good since it helps solidify the categorical ideas introduced, plus he gives a nice example one could work with)<br>
not necessarily in this order, <br>
with the addition of 5. McCullaugh (haven't read, but am willing to dedicate some time to this). <br>
When I get a chance, I'll also look at the abstracts and browse the contents of the papers we've compiled and also let you know (this may take a few days though...)</li>
</ol>

<p>Yes, I'm putting one together. We'll probably start regular meetings next month. I'll post the details here and on the NYC Category Theory <a href="http://meetup.com">meetup.com</a> group. I'll also see about announcing it on the Azimuth forum. If there's enough interest, we may take a poll of goals and split into circles. If we do that, I'll try to weave meetings so that people from separate circles with separate goals still interact.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="296639">@Arthur Parzygnat</span>, I want your advice on something.</p>
<p>I'm still groping my way through basic texts on CT such as Roman's Introduction to the Language of Category Theory, which means that I'm still at a very different level from most of you. On the other hand, I'm probably just competent enough at Probability and Statistics to help guide people who never studied it or forgot most of it. </p>
<p>I'll be trying to attract people from both the general pool at <a href="http://meetup.com">meetup.com</a>, etc. and people from here. There may be wide variance in peoples' prior level of experience in both CT and probability / statistics. </p>
<p>Do you think it would still be rewarding for the more advanced people to go at the pace of the lowest common denominator? (likely me) If not, do you have any thoughts about how we might get the ball rolling for everybody while accommodating differing backgrounds?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="285161">@Oliver Shetler</span> I don't think it will disadvantage anybody. However, expect that we will take our time with things, but also expect that what we do learn, we will learn it very well (I would prefer this pace as opposed to just breezing through material and half-learning it). I suggest that if we focus on a paper that is heavy on the CT but light on the prob/stat, that we supplement as many categorical ideas with those from prob/stat as possible (and vice versa). Since I have experience with CT, I would be able to tell how much CT background a specific paper requires, and since you have some prob/stats background, you'll be able to do something similar on your end (and similarly others who join). This will also help us isolate papers with less required background so that we can start with those.</p>

<p>That sounds like a reasonable plan. I like the idea of deliberatively articulating the requisite concepts for papers. That should make it possible for people to seek supplemental readings and ask coherent background questions in places where they might get lost. Since everybody seems to agree that McCullaugh is a good place to start, that simplifies the issue of sifting through papers for ease. We can look for requisite concepts for McCullaugh that need explaining, and then find then check to see if there are better expositions in other papers. Also people are willing to go slow, we can devise exercises for ourselves to really flesh out the concepts––especially with an eye to clarifying how these concepts can contribute to applications that CT is especially suited for such as NLP, causal models, biostatistics, etc.</p>

<p>As for scheduling, do Saturdays generally work for everybody reading this? If so, I'm thinking we can do our first meeting on the 27th, so people have time to fit it into their schedules. This one will require little to no preparation. We'll just see who shows up and discuss some of what's been said here. I don't want to officially commit to reading any particular paper first until we've heard from the people who actually show up. Maybe there are better introductions to the topic, even if McCullough's paper is in everybody top five reading list. Then we can do first proper discussion meeting on the 11th. After that, we can decide whether people would prefer to do meetings every week or every other week. (My preference would be to do weekly meetings in July, but then scale back to every other week in August / September to accommodate many peoples' return to the Fall academic schedule, but we'll cross that bridge when we get there).</p>

<p>I'll collect and organize exercises / notes that people happen to make on their own, and we can set a goal of writing out at least one explanation of one concept at every meeting. That's the sort of easy concrete outcome that makes regular meetings feel both manageable and worth it.</p>

<p>By the way, I hope whoever is organizing the reading group - <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="285161">@Oliver Shetler</span>? - has a good plan for running it.  There may be <em>lots</em> of people at the first meeting, and if everyone just talks randomly, in proportion to how much they like to talk, it will be chaotic and boring, dominated by the loudest loudmouths.</p>

<p>I think will work better if the discussion is well-organized - e.g. going through a list of topics, having some rules for how much people get to talk and when, etc.  There are lots of possible organizations, but "winging it" is probably not one of the better ones.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span>, thank you for raising your concern about this. Any advice you have would be helpful. In my past reading groups, I've always had book exercises as a mechanism to reign people in. Clearly, this is a different situation. You are much more experienced with organizing meetings and you're good at it (you did a great job with Bradley's presentation, for example).</p>
<p>I'll tell you what the first meeting's goals are and, if you have time, you can reciprocate with some concrete suggestions.</p>
<p>This first meeting is just to discuss group goals / interests, order the papers in priorety, and decide what to read first. I'm hoping to keep the meeting to a maximum range of 1-2 hours.</p>
<p>I was thinking of going through the abstracts or table of contents for each paper and asking people to write down and report any topics or headings that seem especially important to them. I would keep a tally of these to get a sense of peoples' interests and goals.</p>
<p>Then I was thinking we'd try to build a consensus on which paper to tackle first.</p>
<p>Finally, I if there's time, I was thinking that we'd try and pick out one important concept from our paper of choice to focus in on for the next meeting.</p>
<p>I am also thinking of having people each briefly introduce themselves and explain their motivation for coming to the reading group, but I'm on the fence about this because I don't know how many "talkers" will attend. Maybe you have some advice on how to manage this and the above scenarios so things run smoothly?</p>
<p>Finally, I've set up the sign-up process to ask people why they are interested in applying Category Theory to Statistics. I am planning to use these answers, and the tally from the first meeting to privately outline a rough roadmap of topics to cover. (Who shows up to later meetings will also impact this).</p>
<p>Does this sound like a reasonable agenda?</p>
<p>Can you forsee any problems that I should prepare for?</p>
<p>Do you have other ideas about what I might do for this first meeting?</p>
<p>As for future meetings, I'm hoping that each meeting will involve zeroing in on a specific concept from the paper and writing up brief notes on it, then deciding on the topic for the next meeting. Does that sound like a good plan, or are there better ways to organize paper-based reading groups? What have your experiences generally been like?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="285161">@Oliver Shetler</span> , it looks like your ideas for the first meeting seem very reasonable. I would follow exactly those ideas, but also allocate an amount of time for them. I haven't signed up via the meetup, but maybe I should because I plan on attending. And maybe the meetings should only be accessible to those who have signed up? (To get those that are a bit more serious)<br>
As for co-organizing, I'd honestly prefer being one of the more active members than someone who helps with the organization. I can also advise. But yeah, I find the thought of being responsible for organizing is a bit stressful to me, so I'd prefer not to be an official part of that. <br>
I wouldn't be too concerned about John's message/warning. If people drop out after the first meeting, that's fine. A reading/learning seminar can be haphazard, and that's honestly okay in my opinion. It's important not to stress yourself out. If you want, you can get some of the more serious participants (me, maybe Evan? etc) to help you out with a head start. For example, if we're discussing abstracts in the first meeting, some of us can volunteer to read them ahead of time and guide those discussions. (For example, I chose 5 papers for my top 5, and I can talk about why I chose those briefly).</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="296639">@Arthur Parzygnat</span> thanks for the feedback. That all sounds perfectly reasonable. You're right about the attendance thing. In my experience, as many as 20 people can show up at the first meeting and then it can drop to as little as 2 or 3, even if everybody claims they had a great time. I'm not too worried about that. No big expectations here.</p>
<p>Also, I think it's totally fine if people who don't sign up show up. I don't care about "unserious" people showing up. People self-filter. No need for exclusivity. Sometimes people just have different attitudes towards signups. In fact, I had one serious attendee who refused to make a meetup account the entire time, but he attended every week for months.</p>
<p>As for the time limit idea, here's my concrete plan (these notes are as much for my reference as yours). For each abstract, and outline, I'll read it out loud to the group. As I do so, I'll ask people to write out a list of the highlights that stand out to them and post it on a thread in Zulip so I can review it later (that'll impose a natural time limit because we won't verbally discuss it). Then I'll ask people to list 3 articles they wouldn't mind starting with. Then we'll take like 5-15 minutes to pick one. Then we'll take 20 minutes to enumerate all the major concepts in that article and review the highlights people posted for it. We'll pick the first concept and assign a small number of pages for reading. We can save formal introductions for the second meeting, when the self-filtering has begun.</p>
<p>Lastly, no worries about helping to organize. For me, it serves as a mechanism to keep me reading, but it's not everybody's cup of tea. I think if you (and as you mentioned, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275965">@Evan Patterson</span>, if he's willing, or anybody else who might volunteer) could take a look at the abstracts in advance, that would be very helpful though. For me, this first meeting will take place right before 2 exams and a final project in my final week of summer classes, so I'd prefer to keep my role purely to moderator until the next meeting. It would be very helpful if some people read ahead.</p>

<p>Yes!   I was warning him to be ready for a large number of not-necessarily-serious people who may show up at the first meeting; it takes a little skill to run a meeting with &gt; 20 people.   It will become easier when those people drop out.</p>

<p>I bet more than 20 people will attend, so if each person explains their motivation for 1.5 minutes that will take half an hour.  I'm not personally interested in spending half an hour on this, but if you are that's fine.   One option is to do this on the <em>second</em> meeting.</p>

<p>I guess this question is important: are you expecting people to look at McCullagh's paper before the first meeting, or not?   It's not clear from anything you've sent out.</p>

<p>If not, the first meeting will probably be mainly "organizational" in character.   You could however do a great service by walking people through the key points of McCullagh's paper - or planning ahead of time to have someone else do this, someone who knows the paper well.   That would help people read the paper and talk about it next time.</p>

<p>By the way, I thought you'd planned to start with McCullagh's paper.  There are advantages to just asserting something like this, at first, instead of hoping for a couple dozen people who just met each other to make a group decision.   Most of us are hoping you'll take charge, at least at first.   You could say "Let me start by walking you through McCullagh's paper, since it tackles the fundamental question of what's a statistical model" - and then people could comment on that, etc.</p>

<p>If I look like <em>I'm</em> trying to take charge, I'm honestly not.   I'm just hoping you will, so I'm offering suggestions of what that could look like: decisive action instead of long processes where  &gt; 20 people all do something.</p>
<p>Later, when the group shrinks down to a nucleus of people who are strongly committed, it'll make sense for it become more informal, because people will know each other better and have more a sense of collective purpose.   </p>
<p>Btw, I'm not sure I'll be in that nucleus.  Feel free to disregard what I'm saying and do whatever you want.</p>

<p>I'm not expecting this. My assessment is that McCullough's paper is the authoritative work on statistical models, but it isn't the only possible starting point. I see two possible alternative starting points. </p>
<p>First, there might be expository sections in other papers that would serve as a good first introduction to some of McCullough's ideas (I think <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275965">@Evan Patterson</span>'s thesis might have some good introductory materials, for example).</p>
<p>Second, a degree in statistics starts with probability theory, not statistical models. Therefore, it _might_ be better to start with Markov Categories or some other probability-based paper.</p>
<p>We will do McCullough either first or second. That much I'm comfortable committing to. But I wanted to leave some options open. It the default decision if people fail to decide though.</p>

<p>I'm thinking of basically putting each paper up on screen-share and asking people to note the parts they like. Maybe reading out loud isn't the best approach though. The idea is that everybody can look at the same thing at the same time and dump their impressions into a Zulip thread. I'm hoping to use that as a way of getting a feel for the highlights of each paper (according to the group).</p>

<p>I was planning on reading McCullagh's paper on my own already, so for me it seems like a natural starting place. I also think that while I learned statistics starting with probability theory, one of my undergraduate professors teaches his statistics courses starting with statistical models and I prefer that approach more, if for no other reason than it gives a goal to built up the probability theory toward. <br>
As another comment, given that we can expect a pretty high disengagement rate between the first and second meetings, I personally would rather have all personal preferences stuff and whatnot be reserved for a Doodle poll per John's suggestion.

<p>Hi <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="295574">@Andrea Stine (she) (UCR)</span>, if you're not interested in the housekeeping, no worries. Just show up on the 11th for our first proper reading group meeting. The assigned reading and goals will be posted after the first meeting.</p>

<p>If I had decided to approach this by just assigning readings, that's when I would have scheduled the first meeting anyway. This meeting is just to gather qualitative data and get peoples' input on some things.</p>

<p>I've been reading introductory chapters in Patterson's thesis and got really lost on monoidal categories, anyone has suggestions on what I can read to get up to speed? Preferrably something with exercises.<br>
For the context I think I have a solid grasp on simple definitions of category theory up to natural transformations</p>

<p>Yeah, what I wrote in that chapter is not a substitute for a proper introduction to monoidal categories. I first learned about monoidal categories from the early chapters of <em>New Structure for Physics</em>, particularly the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.0340">Rosetta Stone paper</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0905.3010">Categories for the practicing physicist</a> (much of which doesn't require that you know anything about physics). I like both these introductions a lot.</p>

<p>It seems like machine representation of statistical models is a big source of interest for a lot of people. That's definitely a theme we should keep in mind as we read. If the interest remains strong, it will make sense to look at the machine representation portions of Patterson's paper as soon as we've developed the general foundations we need.</p>

<p><strong>McCullagh</strong> (5, 7): The problem of formalizing what it means for a statistical model to have a natural extension to a larger set of observational units is a good one. I'm interested in how this might be related to replicability problems in science, see e.g. this paper on the <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/jqw35">"generalizability crisis"</a>. I think that category theory should have something to say about how statistical models from different experiments are compatible with each other (or not).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank you for the reference, this is a great paper. In the conclusion, the author says that psychologists can _either_ narrow the scope of their claims to reflect the scope of their models or ignore the issue, perpetuating the problem.</p>
<p>It seems like categorical statistics could help play a role in developing a "third option" where psychologists who are willing to work hard could develop statistical models that do, in fact, reflect most of what they want to claim. This is a very exciting idea for me, because my main domain of scientific interest is in psychology and brain science.</p>
<p>Hopefully the solutions will be sufficiently general that they can be exported from Category Theory and used by people who don't know CT.</p>

That seems like a problem that CT could help solve.</p>
<p>In general, I am deeply skeptical about the usefulness and reliability of scientific "theories" that do not go beyond verbal descriptions, and I think that scientists and statisticians need to get more serious about rigorizing this part of science.

<p>I'm mostly in the same camp as you and old Karl Popper on that, though I'm quite optimistic about our ability to refine qualitative language to the point where it's sophisticated enough to call mathematical (yet still qualitative –– like "perfect sets" or "attracting spiral nodes" etc.)</p>
<p>One way forward might be to focus primarily on incorporating the ambiguity in these theories, rather than excoriating it (as many verificationists do).</p>
<p>For example, in the case of ego depletion, the overall idea is that (1) humans operate at different "rates" while in different motivational states (akin to temperature)* and (2) operating at different "temperatures" consume a virtual resource, which behaves like a conserved quantity in the short term, and behaves like a metabolic resource that replenishes in the medium term. We also know that this construct is virtual, and not valid, because there are counter examples.</p>
<p>For example, runners can get a second and third wind if they push past perceived exhaustion. More problematically, working on a project all day every day can be invigorating or exhausting depending on the psychological meaning of the situation to a person. However, even in this case, a person will eventually succumb to the need for sleep or distraction or both. Therefore, any refined theory will have to model semantic frames and get clearer about how to define the "temperature" of a person's motivational state (see * below for one possible refinement).</p>
<p>If I was earnestly working on this problem, my overall approach would be to start with a naive overly precise model –– a resource theory. Then I would generalize to a manifold of resource theories. First, I would pick a manageable domain for my theory (a specific sport, the military, academia, etc). I would do some phenomenological research to figure out which dimensions are appropriate to include in my model. That is, I would (1) reflect on the issue, (2) I would gather a maximally variable set of cases of interest and (3) do multidimensional scaling surveys where I ask people to say how similar the different situations I've collected are, thereby extracting the dimensionality of the principal components. </p>
<p>Next, I would generalize my theory to a manifold of dynamical descriptions. I would try to construct a qualitative transition diagram like the one Strogatz reproduces in his book Dynamical Systems and Chaois:<br>
<a href="/user_uploads/21317/zu_LxVraTic6z2peMiTXen1K/MK1aC.gif">MK1aC.gif</a></p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/21317/zu_LxVraTic6z2peMiTXen1K/MK1aC.gif" title="MK1aC.gif"><img src="/user_uploads/21317/zu_LxVraTic6z2peMiTXen1K/MK1aC.gif"></a></div><p>but one that characterizes when people "give up" or change motivational states in other ways, with respect to the dimensions I constructed using multidimensional scaling. (Most likely, the model would be a dynamical system theory whose underlying quantities describe probabilities as well as aggregated states such as the "temperature" I described above, so it would be a highly layered model).</p>
<p>Then I would use statistically appropriate empirical data––and anecdotal counterexamples––to look for discrepancies between my qualitative model of when people give up and when they actually give up. Then I would repeat for another domain, and another until I could convince some poor grad student that s/he should take up my cause <span aria-label="smiling devil" class="emoji emoji-1f608" role="img" title="smiling devil">:smiling_devil:</span></p>
<p>Overall, by focusing on building a qualitative model of a class of "models," or a class of classes of "models," it's possible to build a model that is sufficiently ambiguous / qualitative to be true to the idea you are describing. It's a lot of work, which is why people rarely do it, but it's possible. At least, I have faith that it is possible in the same way that enlightenment natural philosophers such as Galileo had faith that the universe was 'rational.'</p>

<p>I couldn't agree more. In the above example, CT could make the process of making metaphors precise and extending models much more approachable than without CT.</p>
<p>My hope is that Category Theory can be a secret tool (then, hopefully, a not-so-secret tool) for making these kinds of problems tractable. (there are probably a lot of problems with my off-the-cuff 'proposal' but you get the idea)</p>
<p>[*] This is metaphor may be more literal than it seems. Georg Northoff has a theory of consciousness that quantitatively relates the phenomenology of mood to the variability of neural signals (as measured by EEG signals and fast magnetic imaging). Northoff identifies the prefrontal / orbitofrontal brain region as the source of perceptions about the outside world and he identifies  the thalimaco-parietal region with perceptions about the inner world. These relations are relative. For example, a person who has high neural variability in the prefrontal region and low variability in the thalimaco-parietal region would feel as if the world is moving "too fast" for them, causing the mood of depression. People with the reverse condition feel manic, even though their thoughts are disordered. So the metaphor of mood or motivation as "temperature" has a stronger foundation than you'd think at first glance.</p>

<p>Evan - Thanks for sharing that paper.  I'll just share that a related topic in causal inference is called "transportability", or to quote <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5536-transportability-from-multiple-environments-with-limited-experiments-completeness-results">this paper</a>: "transferring causal knowledge collected in several heterogeneous domains to a target domain in which only passive observations and limited experimental data can be collected".</p>

<p>One potential direction we could add for future reading could be Baudot &amp; Bennequin on statistical quantities through homological algebra.<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KrPrjBUPyo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KrPrjBUPyo</a><br>
Baudot P, Bennequin D. The homological nature of entropy. Entropy. 2015 May;17(5):3253-318.<br>
Basically, as I understand it (and I don't quite understand their work yet) - they create an abelian (?) category in which entropy and relative entropy appear as the essentially unique generators of non-trivial cohomology classes through the bar construction.</p>

<p>Hi all, we've decided that we've reached a point where everybody has a good foothold on the concepts from McCullagh. We've decided to move on to reading Patterson's thesis as a next step because he extends the ideas in McCullagh.</p>
<p>Here is the meeting description for our next meeting on Saturday, September 5.</p>
<p>Zoom ID: 807 569 857</p>
<p>This week, we will be taking a first look at Evan Patterson's PhD Thesis "The Algebra and Machine Representation of Statistical Models" available here:<br>
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.08945.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.08945.pdf</a></p>
<p>Patterson extends the ideas from our last paper by McCullagh. Please read the introductory section and watch Patterson's presentation available here:<br>
