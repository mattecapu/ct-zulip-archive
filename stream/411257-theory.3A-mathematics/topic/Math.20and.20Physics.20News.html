<p>Hi! This is a general thread where we can discuss interesting news in math and mathematical physics. Feel free to share any interesting news you might have come across (does not have to directly relate to category theory). Every so often I'll post an interesting article along with (perhaps open ended) discussion questions laced in.</p>

<p>I'll start it off with <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-new-geometry-for-einsteins-theory-of-relativity-20250716/">this article</a> from one of my favorite science news sites, Quanta magazine (I'll probably be citing them a lot on this thread). In this article they cover ways of doing general relativity without calculus in what they call "non-smooth surfaces"- spacetimes where there can be edges and discontinuities like singularities. The goal is to try and extend results from GR (such as singularity theorems) to the non-smooth setting in the case that non-smooth geometry better describes the universe than smooth geometry (the article argues this to be the case, but I personally don't see why, since GR has achieved great success in its current smooth form). Though it is a little confusing that there'd be this research program when the major consensus among physicists is that singularities are mere mathematical artifacts and do not exist in any physical sense.</p>

<p>From the mathematical perspective, the main object covered is "non-smooth spacetimes", which apparently are a generalization of smooth ones (so there's an embedding from the category of smooth Lorentzian manifolds into the category of these spaces). Usual differential geometry does not apply, but the article cites how some calculus-like results are still possible in these spaces. This makes me wonder how this effort might relate to synthetic differential geometry- might there be some variant of that which applies to this category, or maybe this will eventually inspire a new field of "synthetic non-smooth geometry" as a generalization of synthetic differential geometry. <br>
One proposed definition for "non-smooth spacetime" is given <a href="https://ef-geometry.univie.ac.at/about/#sec-5">here</a> (on the official website, Quanta does not usually go into the mathematical details). These are called "Lorentzian pre-length spaces". It doesn't seem immediately clear what (if anything) these have to do with Minkowski space. Ideally, even a non-smooth spacetime should still, in some sense "locally look like" Minkowski space. So I'm not sure how that manifests here- something to think about!</p>

<p>Thanks for initiating this!</p>
<p>One thing worth noting is that there's no physical reason to expect solutions of the PDE in physics to be 'smooth' in the strict sense of infinitely differentiable.   For example, for the vacuum Maxwell equations, the finite-energy solutions are typically not smooth: instead, the components of the electric and magnetic fields only need to be in <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>L</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msup><mi mathvariant="double-struck">R</mi><mn>3</mn></msup><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">L^2(\mathbb{R}^3)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1.0641em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal">L</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.8141em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathbb">R</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.8141em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">3</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span> at any given time.   People have analyzed the hell out of the physically appropriate function spaces for solutions of the PDE of physics, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobolev_space">Sobolev spaces</a> and such.  It's particularly easy for the vacuum Maxwell's equations and other linear PDE, but people (like me, in my youth) have done a lot of work on nonlinear wave equations using this technology.  Einstein's equations of general relativity are particularly challenging: e.g. Christodoulou and Klainerman won great acclaim for a <a href="https://www.ams.org/notices/199904/comm-bocher-prz.pdf">500-page book proving the stability of Minkowsksi spacetime</a>, which necessarily uses Sobolev spaces rather than smooth solutions.</p>
<p>I haven't read the <em>Quanta</em> article yet, but I'm guessing that things like "Lorentzian pre-length spaces" go beyond the usual story.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>They may or may not be "mere mathematical artifacts".  There is not a unique definition of "singularity" in general relativity: there are many kinds of singular behavior, and it's far from obvious which are physically reasonable and which are not.  Mathematical physicists approach theories of physics by studying the equations of physics, seeing what they predict.  The question of which solutions are'"mere artifacts" slowly becomes easier to answer as we gain more knowledge.   So there's been a huge research program of studying singularities in general relativity, starting with the Nobel-winning work of Penrose and parallel work of Hawking, and continuing to this day.    </p>
<p>For example, an interesting question is whether singularities in general relativity are always hidden behind an event horizon.    Various conjectures along these lines have been disproved.</p>

<p>That's quite interesting (yet unexpected). A while ago on here I tried to learn some basic bundle theory, but it was all in the context of smooth manifolds since those were the usual setting of differential geometry. This makes me wonder which category is the one where these Sobolev spaces become relevant- IE, where the spaces of sections of bundles form Sobolev spaces. That becomes tricky if the functions aren't even required to be continuous. Maybe you have to make use of local sections- for instance, the sign function is discontinuous over the reals but not over the reals minus the point at zero.</p>

<p>From what I've learned, there's two kinds of singularity: coordinate and curvature singularities. A coordinate singularity is certainly a mathematical artifact even from within GR, since it isn't diffeomorphism invariant: you can change your coordinates to remove it (IE, the event horizon of a BH). A curvature singularity is the kind the article talks about, it's a diffeomorphism invariant point where GR predicts its own failure and "blows up". It's not technically an artifact in GR- it's a direct prediction of GR thanks to the singularity theorems. What I meant by "artifact" was that it seems (at least by my impression) to be a popular belief that the incorporation of quantum mechanics will resolve the singularity. For instance, in traditional QM, singularities are impossible because Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states it's impossible to infinitely localize something in space, hence it's not possible for there to be a point with infinite density and zero volume.</p>

<p>Differential geometers like to assume everything is infinitely differentiable since that makes the math easy.  Mathematical physicists start with differential geometry but then go further, adding analysis.   There are a couple of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>There's no physical reason to think fields are infinitely differentiable; if we only assume some conserved quantities like energy have finite values, or expected values, then we can conclude only that fields like in various Sobolev spaces (or related spaces).</li>
<li>To prove that PDE have solutions, it's much easier to use Sobolev spaces, even if you ultimately are trying to prove they have infinitely differentiable solutions given infinitely differentiable initial data.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, mathematical physicists, or even differential geometers <em>who want to study solutions</em> of PDE like the Yang-Mills equations or Einstein equations, can't work in the smooth context.  The smooth context is just a first step before the real work starts.</p>

<p>There are dozens of kinds of singularities in general relativity.  Coordinate singularities are merely the result of a bad choice of coordinates, so we avoid them by avoiding bad choices.    But saying that the curvature "blows up" is very vague, and when we try to make it precise we discover there are many different concepts of curvature singularity.   </p>
<p>Furthermore, there are ways for solutions of GR to "suddenly end" even without the curvature blowing up.   In fact the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose%E2%80%93Hawking_singularity_theorems#Singularity">Hawking and Penrose singularity theorems</a> only show "null geodesic incompletness", not that curvature blows up.    Can we find physically realistic hypotheses that together with Einstein's equations guarantee that the curvature need to blow up in some sense?  This is an area of active research.</p>

<p>Yes, I understood you meant that.   This is indeed a popular belief.    However, physicists working on general relativity don't say "quantum mechanics will change what happens, so we won't study the classical Einstein's equations too hard".     Instead they study the hell out of Einstein's equations to see what they can learn - and just because it's fun!</p>

<p>By the way, if you check out Freed and Uhlenbeck's <em>Instantons and Four-Manifolds</em> you'll see that the classification of smooth 4-manifolds involves a lot of PDE and Sobolev spaces.  Back then it was done using Yang-Mills theory; more recently the Seiberg-Witten equations have largely taken over.</p>

<p>Since I used to work on PDE, the Sobolev embedding theorem was my friend, back then.  Seiberg-Witten is easier than Yang-Mills because it's 'less nonlinear', but even for linear elliptic PDE, Sobolev theory is how you prove the solutions are smooth.</p>

<p>Ah, I wasn't aware. I haven't studied much GR, but from what I've heard it's quite complicated and at times unintuitive (though arguably it's probably more intuitive than QFT, but that's not saying much). It's on my list to learn at some point in the future though!</p>

<p>There's something simple I forgot to say.  If the only way for solutions of GR to "suddenly end" were for the curvature to blow up, this would be a strong hint that quantum gravity might save the day and eliminate this problem.    After all, as curvature gets large we expect - by simple dimensional analysis - that quantum gravity effects should become large.  But in fact, solutions can "suddenly end" without the curvature blowing up.   This makes it more challenging to imagine how quantum gravity will save the day.  </p>
<p>I was looking around for a good explanation of these issues, and I bumped into <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04616v2">this</a> quick but helpful passage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In fact, there are different ways to define singularities. The most common ones include the curvature singularity and geodesic incompleteness. Curvature singularity usually means that the curvature invariants are divergent somewhere. Among all the invariants, seventeen curvature invariants, called Zakhary-Mcintosh (ZM) invariants, form a complete set. For spherically symmetric spacetimes, it has been shown that the Kretschmann scalar <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>K</mi><mo>=</mo><msup><mi>R</mi><mrow><mi>a</mi><mi>b</mi><mi>c</mi><mi>d</mi></mrow></msup><msub><mi>R</mi><mrow><mi>a</mi><mi>b</mi><mi>c</mi><mi>d</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">K = R^{abcd}R_{abcd}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07153em;">K</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">=</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.9991em;vertical-align:-0.15em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.00773em;">R</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.8491em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mathnormal mtight">ab</span><span class="mord mathnormal mtight">c</span><span class="mord mathnormal mtight">d</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.00773em;">R</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.3361em;"><span style="top:-2.55em;margin-left:-0.0077em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mathnormal mtight">ab</span><span class="mord mathnormal mtight">c</span><span class="mord mathnormal mtight">d</span></span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.15em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> and the Ricci square <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>R</mi><mrow><mi>a</mi><mi>b</mi></mrow></msup><msub><mi>R</mi><mrow><mi>a</mi><mi>b</mi></mrow></msub></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">R^{ab}R_{ab}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.9991em;vertical-align:-0.15em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.00773em;">R</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.8491em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mathnormal mtight">ab</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.00773em;">R</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.3361em;"><span style="top:-2.55em;margin-left:-0.0077em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mathnormal mtight">ab</span></span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.15em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> are sufficient to determine whether all the seventeen ZM invariants are  finite or infinite. Geodesic incompleteness refer to that the affine parameter along a timelike or null geodesic can not be extended to arbitrarily large values in either the future or past direction.</p>
<p>The two definitions are consistent in many cases, such as the central singularities in the Schwarzschild black hole and in the Kerr black hole. However, counterexamples have been found. For the well known C-metric, there exists a conic singularity while all polynomial curvature scalars are finite. On the other hand, [some] spacetimes with curvature singularities are found to be geodesically complete. This may seem incredible, since a metric usually cannot exist where a curvature singularity appears. In fact, a regular metric can generate a spacetime with curvature singularities and a series of solutions have been explicitly constructed.   Unlike the usual curvature singularity where the metric cannot be defined, the metric is well defined where the curvature blows up. In such spacetimes, particles or light can reach or pass through the singularity.</p>

<p>All these points have made me wonder about something. I could be completely off base with this so please let me know if I am... But it seems there's a gap between what we intuitively expect to be the case in GR and what can be the case- for instance, diverging notions of singularity (like the ones mentioned in the article above), existence of naked singularities, potentially any sort of scenario where CTCs might exist, and many similar occurrences. For brevity, I'll refer to these collectively as "pathological spacetimes" as an analogy to topology, where there's many "pathological spaces" that are perfectly self-consistent yet defy our personal intuitions. My question is then: why don't we just "restrict out" these spacetimes, in the same way we often restrict to less pathological topologies when doing topology?</p>

After all, we've never experimentally/observationally observed a naked singularity or a condition where the different notions of singularity diverge. Thus, a theory (a modification to EFE) that predicts only the non-pathological spacetimes is just as consistent with the data as EFE, with the bonus that there's no "extra baggage" of having these pathological spacetimes.</p>

<p>As sort of an example of this, let's consider naked singularities. Physicists have spent much time trying to show these don't exist and have failed to do so consistently, as mentioned. But what if, instead, they were to take the option of simply <em>declaring</em> that naked singularities don't exist and going from there? Now, the work isn't to assume EFE is true and try to prove something that just isn't true within that framework, but instead to start with a physically reasonable assumption and derive the corresponding mathematical framework- in this case a modification to EFE that eliminates the possibility of spacetimes with naked singularities- and see what its consequences are and if this modification is reasonable to make. The only reason I currently can see this might fail is if it's impossible to avoid "throwing out the baby with the bathwater"- that is, the very act of trying to modify EFE to eliminate naked singularities also eliminates more "valid" solutions to EFE we might have already observed. My question is then ultimately: why don't (or can't) physicists do this- is it mathematically impossible for some reason, does it lead to a contradiction, does it lead to this "baby bathwater" conundrum, or is it just something they don't do for whatever reason?</p>

<p>Spacetimes with singularities are not pathological: in general relativity we intuitively expect them, essentially because as matter collapses its gravity keeps getting stronger making it collapse more.   </p>
<p>We can formalize this: that's what the Penrose and Hawking singularity theorems are about, and that's why those guys are famous.   I explained those theorems here:</p>

<p>Singularities are physically important, since our universe started with one, every star bigger than about 3 solar masses becomes one, the center of most galaxies contains one, and the future of our universe will be dominated by them.   </p>
<p>(Please don't talk about how quantum gravity may change this story, because while that's true, we're talking about solutions of the equations of general relativity right now, and general relativity fits what we see well enough to be worth studying.)</p>
<p>Closed timelike curves are different: we often rule those out by focusing on 'globally hyperbolic' spacetimes:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globally_hyperbolic_manifold">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globally_hyperbolic_manifold</a></p>

<p>If you have interesting theorems you can prove assuming your spacetime doesn't have a naked singularity, that's fine - nobody will complain.  Of course you have to <em>define</em> a naked singularity, and there are various ways you might do that, but there are some well-known ways.</p>
<p>But if mathematical physicists had said "let's never think about naked singularities", then Preskill and Thorne probably wouldn't have found conditions under which spherically symmetric infalling matter creates a naked singularitiy, and Christodoulou probably wouldn't have proved that <em>generically</em> this does not occur for spherically symmetric solutions: i.e., the set of solutions <em>without</em> a naked singularity is open and dense.  </p>
<p>So, we would be in the situation of closing our eyes so as to not see a scary thing, instead of investigating whether that scary thing is really likely to occur.</p>
<p>And I think we'd be poorer for that.</p>

<p>Ah, I think I should have been clearer. I didn't consider spacetimes with singularities in general to be pathological- only spacetimes with naked singularities, or singularities where the notions of singularity (infinite curvature, geodesic incompleteness, etc.) do not converge. I do think that singularities in general are important for exactly the reasons you describe!</p>

<p>But if mathematical physicists had said "let's never think about naked singularities", then Preskill and Thorne probably wouldn't have found conditions under which spherically symmetric infalling matter creates a naked singularitiy, and Christodoulou probably wouldn't have proved that <em>generically</em> this does <em>not</em> occur for spherically symmetric solutions: i.e., the set of solutions <em>without</em> a naked singularity is open and dense.</p>
<p>So, we would be in the situation of closing our eyes so as to not see a scary thing, instead of investigating whether that scary thing is really likely to occur.</p>

<p>I see, that makes sense!</p>

<p>Maybe it can be related to Verlinde's theory of entropic gravity? Though we're not sure at the moment if that is a "true thing". Though there's also work done by a mathematical physicist named Gabriele Carcassi (if you haven't heard of him I recommend checking out his Youtube channel!) that suggest there's actually a generic relationship between entropy and geometry. That is, if something geometry-like occurs in mathematical physics, there's a good chance it can be reformulated into something involving an entropy-like quantity and vice versa. I believe it's one of his main research programs to make this statement more precise.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, Verlinde's work is much cruder than Jacobson's.  For example <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0785">Verlinde gets Newtonian gravity</a> from some assumptions about entropy and gravity that aren't very clearly stated, while <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9504004">Jacobson gets Einstein's equation</a> from a few clearly stated assumptions.  But Verlinde's work got a lot more publicity.</p>

<p>Sorry to barge into this discussion with a naive question. Are those singularities like magnetic monopoles? In such a case, we are simply taking as probing spaces certain punctured spacetime patchs (usually globally hyperbolic), which results in non trivial holonomy. Is the case of singularities in general relativity similar to that or there are really authentic singular spaces in the game (like the ones we study in stratified geometry)?</p>

<p>As discussed earlier in this thread, "singularities" in general relativity are quite diverse.

So it's not a stratified space, just a smooth manifold with a smooth Lorentzian metric on it.   Instead, the "singularity" refers to the fact that this smooth Lorentzian manifold is smaller than we expect it to be, and there's no good way to extend it to a larger one obeying Einstein's equations.   </p>
<p>Since "smaller than we expect it to be" and "no good way" can be made precise in various ways, there are various precise concepts of "singularity" in general relativity.   As I explained earlier, two important  kinds are curvature singularities and geodesic incompleteness:</p>

<p>Geodesic incompleteness is the more important of the two, in that we know more theorems about it.</p>
<p>However, geodesic incompleteness is easily obtained by taking an open subset of a perfectly nice Lorentzian manifold like <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi mathvariant="double-struck">R</mi><mn>4</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{R}^4</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8141em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathbb">R</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.8141em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">4</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> with its Minkowski metric.   This incompleteness can be easily "cured".  So for a better concept of singularity one needs to supplement geodesic incompleteness by a condition saying that a Lorentzian manifold can't be extended to a larger one in a good way.</p>

<p>I thought a solution was a choice of a pseudo-metric on an already pre-existing manifold. If so, as I understand the lack of solution on certain points of such manifold could be seen in the same way as a monopole, no? If I recall correctly one can either consider a monopole either as a puncturing in a contractible space or by putting a delta function (as a field or observable? I don't remember...) and keeping the entire space.</p>

<p>By the way, if we replaced the word "magnetic" with "electric" in my last comment, everything would still be true, and it would be more relevant to real-world physics because electrically charged particles exist while magnetically charged ones have never been seen.</p>

<p>I was thinking something along the lines of <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/first-order+formulation+of+gravity">this nlab page</a>. So, perhaps, something a sheaf associating for each manifold the field of configurations given by some stack of pseudo-metrics. Though I don't know how the variation in time of field configurations is supposed to be given here.</p>
<p>I'm more used to the setting of AQFT, but there the (co)sheaf is from patches of a fixed spacetime, so I don't really know how people formulate gravity in such setting.</p>

<p>Really!? No distributional solution? I recall seeing a paper several years ago where I think it was claimed magnetic monopoles could be given on a contractible space by adding discontinuous potentials, but I can't remember now the exact claim.</p>

<p>My limited understanding is that de Rham introduced currents (<a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/current+%28distribution+theory%29">https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/current+%28distribution+theory%29</a>) as a way to talk about the source term J in Maxwell's equations where this could be something akin to a delta function (you can measure the current by integrating around it, but it has no actual values where the physical current is). He mentions this in the papers from the mid/late 1930s, where the theory was still rather crude, and only after Schwartz introduced distributions (also so-named because of electromagnetism! But this time distributions of charges) did de Rham recognise how to write his  currents in terms of the dual of a space of compactly-supported smooth test forms.</p>

<p>Since Maxwell's equations link the physical current to the (derivatives of the) E and B fields, these derivatives are themselves (de Rham) currents. I haven't thought about how E and B themselves may fail to "work" even as currents, at the singular support of J.</p>

<p>I see. So the point is that your integral is on a 3d space and that sphere has measure 0.</p>
<p>Still, back to the original question. Is that nlab definition starting from a fixed manifold and, then, considering the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Einstein-Hilbert+action">Einstein-Hilbert functional</a> on a fixed space of pseudo-metrics (over a fixed manifold) not the usual approach?</p>
<p>If we fix a 3d space <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>S</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">S</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05764em;">S</span></span></span></span>, as long as we assume that everything is globally hyperbolic, there would be no harm in considering the spacetime to be, as a manifold, <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>S</mi><mo>×</mo><mi mathvariant="bold">R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">S \times \mathbf{R}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.7667em;vertical-align:-0.0833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05764em;">S</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span><span class="mbin">×</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6861em;"></span><span class="mord mathbf">R</span></span></span></span>, right?</p>

<p>. Is that nLab definition starting from a fixed manifold and, then, considering the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Einstein-Hilbert+action">Einstein-Hilbert functional</a> on a fixed space of pseudo-metrics (over a fixed manifold) not the usual approach?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That approach is mainly good for deriving Einstein's equation starting from an action, and proving some facts about solutions of Einstein's equation.</p>
<p>But suppose you want to predict what will happen if you know what's happening now.    Then you need to <em>solve</em> Einstein's equation.  You need to start with initial data, solve Einstein's equation, and find the maximal manifold (or maximal globally hyperbolic manifold) on which the solution exists.</p>

<p>So it's enough to consider the on-shell space of field configurations to be the solutions of the action functional on the space of pseudo-metrics in <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>S</mi><mo>×</mo><mi mathvariant="double-struck">R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">S \times \mathbb{R}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.7667em;vertical-align:-0.0833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05764em;">S</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span><span class="mbin">×</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6889em;"></span><span class="mord mathbb">R</span></span></span></span> quotiented by its diffeomorphisms (as a stack). Is that the conclusion? If so, that’s also what the nlab is pointing to.</p>
<p>Also, back to what I briefly wondered here before, how one does usually restate such field theory of gravity functorially? The usual approachs (for instance, <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/causally+local+net+of+observables">AQFT</a> or FQFT à la Atiyah-Segal) all have as domain either a cat containing as objects spacetimes with an already specified pseudo-metric (say, globally hyperbolic manifolds) or an euclidean variant (to be interpreted as a Wick rotated version).</p>

<p>That's correct if you're doing Lagrangian field theory. </p>
<p>In my initial remark, the one that led to our conversation here, I was taking more of an astrophysicist's perspective.   If you're trying to see what happens when two neutron stars collide, you don't extremize an action functional over all Lorentzian metrics on a fixed manifold.  You solve an initial value problem, where (very roughly) you're given the metric on space and its time derivative at <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>t</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">t = 0</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6151em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">t</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">=</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6444em;"></span><span class="mord">0</span></span></span></span>, and you're trying to solve for the metric on spacetime at future times.   Then, depending on how you do things, the manifold on which the solution is defined typically depends on the initial data.</p>

<p>I hope some astrophysics is allowed in this "math and physics news" thread<a href="/user_uploads/21317/cwVemLmVXHUn_5xyG8kPyzRx/cosmic_horseshoe.jpg">:</a></p>

It’s in the massive galaxy in the center here, called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Horseshoe">Cosmic Horseshoe</a>. The blue ring is light from a galaxy behind the Cosmic Horseshoe, severely bent by gravity.</p>
<p>This black hole is 36 billion times the mass of the Sun. It’s not just ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole">supermassive</a>’: any black hole over 10 billion times the Sun’s mass is considered ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_massive_black_holes">ultramassive</a>’. Not many have been found.</p>
<p>To me the coolest part is that the Cosmic Horseshoe has swallowed all the other galaxies in its group: it’s part of something called a ‘fossil group’.</p>
<p>Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is part of a group too: the Local Group. Many smaller galaxies have already fallen into ours. Eventually the Milky Way and Andromeda may collide and form a single bigger galaxy. This will be an ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptical_galaxy">elliptical galaxy</a>’—too disorganized to have spiral arms. So it’s not surprising that if you wait long enough, galaxy groups form a single big elliptical galaxy which eventually eats the rest.</p>
<p>Some ancient galaxy groups have already done this, and they’re called '<a href="https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/*/Fossil+Groups">fossil groups</a>’. The Cosmic Horseshoe is the biggest galaxy in one particular fossil group: it’s 100 times heavier than the Milky Way. It’s surrounded by a halo of very hot gas, 10 million Kelvin, emitting lots of X rays. But most of its mass can’t be explained by stars, gas and dust, so we say 90% is dark matter. All this is completely typical of a fossil group, except the Cosmic Horseshoe is bigger than average.</p>
<p>Fossil groups show us what the future will be like. Big galaxies will eat the rest, and big black holes at the center of these galaxies will eventually eat most of the matter. Dark matter—whatever that is—takes longer to fall in. But there’s plenty of time.</p>
<p>Here’s the new paper about this ultramassive black hole. Luckily, it’s free to read:</p>

<p>That's quite cool! It seems the black hole is so massive because maybe when the galaxies were merging, their supermassive black holes also ended up merging. I know there's some sort of "final parsec problem" but it's instances like these where it's clear supermassive black holes do end up merging with each other, somehow!</p>
<p>I also like the perspective that this might be somewhat like the fate of our own local group when the Milky Way and Andromeda form the Milkomeda galaxy.</p>

<p>I'll have to read about the "final parsec problem".  It makes sense: black holes aren't like vacuum cleaners that suck up everything; two black holes a light year apart will orbit each other and spiral down <em>very</em> slowly due to gravitational radiation unless there's enough matter around to radiate away energy.</p>

<p>I recently read through <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/cosmic-paradox-reveals-the-awful-consequence-of-an-observer-free-universe-20251119/">this Quanta article</a> and wanted to share my thoughts on it here. It's about how a particular calculation in quantum gravity for a closed de sitter universe leaves the Hilbert space of the universe at a single dimension- essentially, it leaves it seemingly "empty of information". The physicists interviewed for the article go on to suggest a potential way to solve this problem is to introduce an observer into the universe, which then of course implies that observers are required for the physics to work. </p>
<p>Of course, I have many issues with the concept of needing "observers" in physics. My main objection is that humans (and any other animals that might count as "observers") are a non-fundamental part of the universe, and it feels weird to have to include something so non-fundamental into a fundamental theory of reality. So I automatically find any theory that requires macroscopic observers to be suspect.</p>

<p>What assumption, if any, might be leading this QG calculation astray? I don't know, as I'm no QG expert. But I'll describe my main suspect here. The authors mention an "island formula" which is used to make sense of black holes (IE, in the BH information paradox). That's all fine and good, but here's where I think the mistake is: black holes and AdS spaces are the domain of applicability of the island formula, so trying to apply it to a closed de sitter universe means physicists are applying it outside its domain of applicability. Sure, it seems they can make it work mathematically, but that doesn't mean the physics will work. For instance, you could mathematically extend the Riemann zeta function to negative numbers via analytic continuation, but that doesn't mean you can interpret -1/12 to be the sum of every positive integer.</p>
<p>With the island formula, it seems the main issue is that it works best with the idea of a boundary, since in holographic principle the boundary is where the information about the black hole or AdS space exists. But a closed de sitter universe has no boundary. So perhaps we shouldn't be so surprised when a technique developed in the context of an information-storing boundary claims "zero information" when used in a situation where there are zero boundaries? Again, I'm not an expert in QG so I might be misinterpreting things, any corrections are welcome!</p>

<p>I don't know this particular calculation, but there are simpler situations, namely topological quantum field theories, where the Hilbert space for a closed universe (a certain compact manifold, in particular 3-sphere) is 1-dimensional, but if you chop that manifold into two pieces - two manifolds with boundary - the objects for those two pieces are more interesting.  (They are literally objects: objects in 2-Hilbert spaces.)   We can call the two pieces "the observer" and "the rest of the universe", and some people like to do that, but it has nothing to do with humans or consciousness or macroscopic entities or any other fancy things we might naively expect from the word "observer".   </p>
<p>So, I am not surprised that in a pop physics article, they'd say a closed universe has a 1-dimensional Hilbert space of states until you introduce an observer.   I would expect that if we looked at the math, it would be about something much simpler, like formally dividing the universe into two parts.</p>
<p>For one thing, we have no easy way to introduce concepts like "human" or "consciousness" into physics calculations: these concepts are nightmarishly subtle and complex, and nobody knows how to compute with them.</p>

<p>But even if we're not introducing macroscopic objects into the calculations, I still have an issue with needing to introduce this "division of the universe", which is that it seems completely arbitrary. The actual physics shouldn't depend on an arbitrary choice (this is the whole point of gauge theory), yet here the way we decide to "divide" the universe can be completely arbitrary yet somehow is necessary for the math to work out? </p>
<p>And what if the choice of how we divide the universe actually does matter? For instance, say we have a spherical universe and we choose an arbitrary great circle. One one hemisphere with respect to this great circle, the sphere is filled with uniform matter, and on the other side, it isn't. If we make the dividing cut along the great circle, we end up with one part of the universe with matter, and the other part empty. On the other hand, if we cut perpendicular to it, we end up with two parts of the universe both containing equal amounts of matter. These are two very different situations.</p>

<p>It seems to make a certain amount of sense to me.  The QFTs we have for gravity describe the universe "as seen from outside", and a universe that has no outside will of course have nothing interesting going on from an outside viewpoint.  If you then arbitrarily rip a chunk out of that universe, you get a theory that describes the universe as seen (well, as <em>seeable</em>) from inside that chunk.</p>
<p>Note that making this cut is something kinematical, not dynamical, so it precedes things like the actual distribution of matter inside the universe.</p>

<p>I haven't read the paper <em>Quanta</em> is talking about, but in the theories I know about, called extended topological quantum field theories, the "actual physics" <em>doesn't</em> depend on this arbitrary choice.  </p>
<p>Well, that's actually a bit vague, because the concept of "actual physics" is a bit vague. </p>
<p>For example, in special relativity you can work in any inertial frame of reference, do calculations, get answers, and there's a systematic way to convert those answers into the answers you'd get in another frame of reference.    We could argue about whether the positions and velocities of particles in Minkowski spacetime count as "actual physics" - after all, they depend on a choice of frame of reference, they're not absolute.  But that's an argument for philosophers.   Most physicists are happy enough to say: if you and I choose different frames of reference we'll say different things about the positions and velocities of particles, but we have a systematic recipe to convert my positions and velocities to yours, and the scheme all hangs together.  So frame-dependent quantities don't bother us - after we've been through the trauma of learning special relativity, and recovered from it, and seen that it makes sense.</p>
<p>Somewhat similarly, but in a more complicated way, we can define and compute quantities that depend on a split of the universe into two parts, but there are ways to relate different splittings, and the scheme all hangs together.</p>
<p>(It's more complicated because now there's not just a group acting on the set of inertial frames, but a category whose objects are splittings of the universe.)</p>

<p>Recently I was reading an <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/staf1685">interesting paper</a> that shows there's a possibility the expansion of the universe might be currently decelerating. This might have implications for the Hubble Tension, as well as aligning with results from DESI indicating a weakening dark energy. There have been some criticisms of the paper, so I will be patient and wait for the metaphorical dust to settle before making judgements about the claims in the paper themselves.</p>

<p>However, what I want to cover on here is a misrepresentation or misunderstanding of the paper's results by the popular media designed to generate headlines and clicks. For instance, this article by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/nov/06/universe-expansion-slowing-not-accelerating-nobel-prize">Guardian</a>. The misunderstanding is that the results of the paper directly imply the fate of the universe will be a Big Crunch. I've read through the paper twice and have seen no mention at all of a Big Crunch or anything about the potential fate of the universe, beyond predictions of when the universe's expansion might start decelerating if it hasn't started to do so yet. So this is clearly an extrapolation by the authors of these popular articles rather than a direct statement from the science itself. </p>
<p>One potential explanation is due to a simple misunderstanding of basic physics. The authors of these articles might have seen "decelerating" and confused it with "contracting". Even if the universe's expansion was currently decelerating, it would still be expanding, not contracting. Confusing deceleration for contraction is the same as confusing acceleration with velocity, a basic physics mistake.</p>

<p>If that wasn't the mistake, the confusion might lie in a misunderstanding of the equations physicists use to understand the fate of the universe- namely, the Friedmann Equations for the FLRW metric. <em>Even if all</em> dark energy suddenly vanished today, the universe’s expansion would start to decelerate, but it <em>still</em> wouldn’t recollapse. Given what we know, that the universe seems to have a flat geometry, the Friedmann Equations predict that without dark energy the expansion would simply slow and asymptotically coast to a stop. The DESI-suggested weakening of dark energy is just a milder version of this scenario, so the cosmic fate would be the same. Unless the universe is actually closed on scales we can’t observe, or the FLRW metric fails to actually describe our universe, a future recollapse appears essentially impossible.</p>
