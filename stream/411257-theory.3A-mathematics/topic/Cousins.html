<p>A <a href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@jacobneu/115037333303128790">study of the mathematics of cousins</a> argues that the concepts of "0th cousin" and "(-1)st cousin" make sense.   And a commenter says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So could we use 'negative-2nd cousin' to refer to people who have a child together?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reminds me of how James Dolan noticed that not only 0-categories but also (-1)-categories and (-2)-categories make sense.  I don't see any relation, except that we tend to start counting a bit too late, after a pattern is already going.</p>

<p>The commenter is <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276945">@Oscar Cunningham</span> who is also here!<br>
In this case it seems that the suggestion is that the entire diagram has a "mirror image" which goes all the way into the negative numbers, with (-1, 0) as the centre of symmetry (rather than just a few extra steps as in the case of (-2) and (-1)-categories).</p>

<p>Yes, my thought was just that an ancestor a negative number of generations up must instead be a descendant. But someone replied to me pointing out a qualitative difference: someone you share an ancestor with is a blood relative, whereas someone you share a descendent with isn't. So maybe the concepts aren't analogous after all, or maybe we should call such people 'coblood related'.</p>

<p>My family had noticed the generalization to 0-cousins and (-1)-cousins before, but not the extension beyond that.  However, now that Oscar pointed it out, I think it makes perfect sense!  It's also useful, because it incorporates existing named relationships (parents-in-law are (-2)-cousins-once-removed) as well as important existing relationships that don't have a name in English (my parents and my wife's parents are (-3)-cousins).</p>

<p>Hey, glad to see my little doodle sparked a conversation! I've had a few thoughts since posting:</p>
<p>For the one-sided cousin diagram (the kind posted, not including in-laws), I think labelling the columns -1, 0, 1, 2, ... makes sense. It corresponds to counting only the generations <em>properly</em> between the people in question and their most recent common ancestor: my sibling is my 0-cousin because there are zero generations between us and our mrca, our parents. Deciding that "there are -1 generations between me and my mrca with X" means "I am my mrca with X, i.e. X is my descendant" is a consistent choice.</p>
<p>However, for the proposed two-sided diagram (which I want to make), I do feel like Me=(0,0) is the logical choice and that there's no reason symmetry should be about -1. It seems more logical to relabel the "Me" column to 0, the sibling column to 1, the first cousin to 2, and so on. That way your "spouse" (more precisely: "co-parent" or "biological spouse", the other parent of your children) is your (-1,0) cousin, reflecting that they have the opposite relation to you as your (1,0) cousin, your sibling. Likewise, your (-2,0) cousins, the other grandparents of your grandchildren, have the opposite place as your "first cousins", your (2,0) cousins. The mismatch with the traditional numbering is unfortunate, but worth it in my opinion</p>

<p>In the homotopy type theory community we fought a long battle against Voevodsky's attempt to renumber "homotopy <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">n</span></span></span></span>-types" as "types of h-level <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n+2</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6667em;vertical-align:-0.0833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">n</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span><span class="mbin">+</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6444em;"></span><span class="mord">2</span></span></span></span>".  His way is undoubtedly more logical, with the contractible types being of h-level 0 rather than "homotopy (-2)-types".  But I always believed (and still do) that we had a hard enough job ahead of us selling the subject to algebraic topologists and category theorists without simultaneously trying to renumber all of their definitions.</p>

<p>By the way, regarding this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>your "spouse" (more precisely: "co-parent" or "biological spouse", the other parent of your children)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think there's a case to be made for using "(-2)nd cousin" more broadly for "spouse", at least colloquially.  From a logico-mathematical point of view, past and future should be symmetrical.  Your 1st cousin is still your 1st cousin even after your shared grandparents are no longer alive, so logically your (-2)nd cousin should already be your (-2)nd cousin even <em>before</em> your shared child is alive.  Of course as a practical matter we are always speaking <em>at</em> some point in time and we don't know for sure what will happen in the future.  But it doesn't seem unreasonable to me to use the observable (and more socially relevant) relation "spouse" as a proxy for the unobservable "present <em>or future</em> co-parent".  In cases when precision is required one could add an adjective like "biological".</p>

<p>I agree that, logically, someone with whom <em>I will one day have a child together</em> should already now be my (-2)nd cousin, but I disagree that this implies that we should be justified in <em>using</em> the term for a spouse, since there is already an epistemic aspect in the “justified usage” of the positive half of the diagram: people can <em>discover</em> that they share an ancestor, and only then they are justified in referring to each other as siblings or cousins.<br>
This has in fact been from time immemorable a common plot point in narratives: X and Y discover the previously unknown fact that they share a parent, and now they are justified in referring to each other as siblings (0th cousins).<br>
The dual trope, where X and Y discover the previously unknown fact that they share a child together, is equally common. Of course it is more common for X and Y to discover the fact already the moment that the child is born. But I would suggest that the correct dualisation is that this is the moment in which X and Y <em>discover that they are (-2)nd cousins</em> and only after that moment they are justified in referring to each other as such.</p>
