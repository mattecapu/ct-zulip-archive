<p>I don't know a definition of "program" other than the definition in computer science!    Maybe there is one.... okay, yes, you can ask for the program at a concert.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's also non/linear programming as in optimization, the program(me) of a conference, a person's research program. My wife was involved in film festivals for a while and I was surprised when she talked about programming. My grandpa called TV shows "programs". Obviously the unifying thing is they're all about detailed instructions/planning. The only objection I could really get is that "program" seems to have a connotation of intention, somehow even more than "code" does, which doesn't exactly make sense for DNA. Well, unless you're talking about synthetic biology, which I think we might be!</p>

<p>Okay, I call TV shows programs - maybe only old people do that?   But I don't think bacteria have TV shows going on inside them.   <span aria-label="upside down" class="emoji emoji-1f643" role="img" title="upside down">:upside_down:</span> </p>
<p>In computer science I think there's a difference between an algorithm, and  a program (which is a specific realization of an algorithm in some language), and what the physical material of the computer is doing when it's running the program.  There are probably even more layers of abstraction (assembly language, etc.).  I'm no expert on the ontology of computer science; someone must have thought a lot about this.</p>
<p>Biology probably involves <em>different</em> layers of abstraction: there's no reason to assume it works the same way.   So if we're trying to understand the world of life, we shouldn't just transplant the concepts from computer science unthinkingly.    </p>
<p>In synthetic biology we are, of course, free to impose any concepts we want, since we're designing new systems.   There we are only limited by <em>what works</em>.</p>
<p>Personally I'm more interested in understanding the living world that came before us than synthetic biology.    I think we have a very crude attitude toward technology, and we have a lot to learn from the living world if we don't flatten it out.   It's been around for a lot longer than us, and it does amazing things we can barely fathom.   Right now we're busy pushing the world toward an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction">mass extinction event</a>, which would be the first extinction event on Earth caused by a supposedly intelligent organism that messes with the biosphere too much before understanding it.</p>

<p>Anyway, I'm interested in this paper by Corentin:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02116v5">Ergodicity, Output-Controllability, and Antithetic Integral Control of Uncertain Stochastic Reaction Networks</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>and would be happy to talk about it!</p>

<p>I am happy to answer any question regarding this paper. It is an extension of the results in the Cell Systems paper I previously mentioned.</p>

<p>I like how your second paper blends control theory with the study of reaction networks.  I wrote a <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/stoch_stable.pdf">book</a> on reaction networks and Petri nets... not using category theory, but <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/RxNet.pdf">later</a> I started working with them using category theory.   I feel there's a lot left to be done, but people seem to be having trouble knowing how to start.  Maybe if we talk here you can come up with something good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am reading at the moment the book on reaction networks and Petri Nets. I may have a few questions at some point but I am waiting to be towards the end to ask them. I am almost done with the book.</p>

<p>We construct Foster-Lyapunov functions and show irreducibility of the state-space. It does not cover all open reaction networks, only unimolecular mass-action networks, certain classes of unimolecular mass-action networks, and certain classes of bimolecular networks.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span> I am now done with the book. It was a very nice read. I was quite familiar with a lot of the contents, so it went fast but I learned quite a few new things that will certainly be useful in the near future, I am sure. I also got a bunch of new references I was not aware of. I will need to go through them soon.</p>
