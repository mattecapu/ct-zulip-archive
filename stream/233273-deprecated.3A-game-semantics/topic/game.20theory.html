<p>Is there any good reference to unify game theory/decision theory with theoretical computer science? I looked at this book that draws connection between expressing game properties with program verification and model checking, but I wonder if there's a better reference that discusses this problem. <br>

<p>I was reading a bit about game semantics a few years ago when I was lot richer but had a lot less knowledge, and had trouble understanding linear logic. If I remember there are two players in the game: one the environement and the other the program or something like that. It seems very relevant for explaining how HTTP works. But as <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275901">@Jules Hedges</span> shows that his games are related to Lenses, and web servers can be <a href="https://gitlab.com/web-cats/CG/-/issues/28#note_666387691">thought of as lenses</a>... </p>
<p>The Web does have another relation to game theory though, in so far as the representationas exchanged (e.g. HTML) is a language that follows a convention - the meaning of <code>&lt;a href="..."&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;</code> is arbitrary) and conventions were given a Game Theoretical analysis by David K. Lewis in his 1969 thesis "Convention".</p>

<p>to be fair, the 99% of people who would understand "game theory" as a reference to the theory of equilibria, would also miss the entire theory of combinatorial games, a la conway-guy-berlekamp, which perhaps has more to do with actual gaming. or not. </p>
<p>the fact that large groups of people use a word like "game",  or "democracy", or "security", in a certain sense does not necessarily mean that their sense is better, or less misleading, than another sense. game semantics was also such a movement, and jules is honestly saying in which context he used his <em>metaphor</em> of games.  </p>

<p>Right.  Just to be clear, I wasn't suggesting any such thing.  I was just finding it hilarious that Jules had to keep telling people that his work on game theory was not about game semantics, since that misunderstanding would only happen in a very specialized environment.

<p>yes, that is a wonderful metaphor!</p>
<p>but now jules has 6666 followers on twitter. and you probably have 666666. the world of communities in networks of networks seems to generate as much complexity in metadata and form as in data and content. it's not just lakes and islands. it's not just that there are boats in the lakes on islands. there are probably islands with lakes with oil platforms, and there are cruisers in the middle of burning oil spills. and there are swimming pool communities on the cruisers in oil in lake on the island in the ocean. maybe there are islands within the swimming pool communities. the web has been really great for lakes on islands. and for distributing the CERN preprints of course.</p>
