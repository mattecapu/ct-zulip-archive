<p>A little piece:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The contemporary mathematician is usually someone who<br>
works on an extremely complex and sophisticated regional area of<br>
specialization in mathematics. To be on his or her level, that is, to be<br>
able to talk about it with him or her as an equal, is often something, as<br>
I said, that less than a dozen people are capable of. Mathematical<br>
elitism where creativity is concerned is extremely exclusive; it’s the<br>
most exclusive of all possible elitisms. Today, given the state of its<br>
dissemination, you can’t just go into mathematics whenever you feel<br>
like. It’s not like inherited wealth: it’s not passed down, and average or<br>
already great, or even very great, knowledge isn’t sufficient. As a result,<br>
mathematics has become very inaccessible. Strictly external references<br>
exist and are reported in the press: someone who has discovered<br>
something very important will win the Fields Medal, with the approval<br>
of his tiny community, and, moreover, amid a widespread lack of<br>
comprehension.</p>
<p>When it comes to philosophy, the problem is the exact opposite, since<br>
just about anyone can be considered a philosopher now. Ever since<br>
philosophers have become “new,” people are very undemanding where<br>
they’re concerned, even at a basic level, I can assure you! In Plato’s,<br>
Descartes’, and Hegel’s time, or even in the late nineteenth century, the<br>
knowledge requirement for claiming you were a “philosopher”<br>
concerned virtually all the different types of knowledge and the<br>
political, scientific, and esthetic discoveries of the time, while, today,<br>
all you need to have are opinions and the right connections in the<br>
media to make people think those opinions are universal, whereas<br>
they’re totally banal. Yet the difference between universality and<br>
banality should be crucial, after all, for a philosopher.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Philosophers">new philosopher</a>" business is a French thing that seems not to have impacted the Anglo-Saxon world very much.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So the divergence between mathematics and philosophy also stems<br>
from the fact that philosophy, owing to the shallow, reactionary figure<br>
of “the new philosopher,” has undergone an incredible trivialization of<br>
its status. The philosophy media stars are, it must be said, and strictly<br>
in terms of the knowledge required to talk about what they talk about,<br>
idiots. In mathematics, they’d be considered the equivalent of a very<br>
average high-school senior. This is, incidentally, an important virtue of<br>
mathematics: it’s impossible to have frauds of that sort in it. But the<br>
flip side of that virtue is that mathematics has become out of reach, or<br>
the object of bitter indifference, because of its elitist isolation from the<br>
other regimes of knowledge. Obviously, with such a rigorous selection<br>
process, we haven’t had any “new mathematicians,” that’s for sure.<br>
And I don’t see how there could be any. A “new mathematician,” even<br>
today, is someone who proves – either with great difficulty or<br>
brilliantly – previously unknown theorems, and you can’t produce<br>
imitations or fakes of those, it’s absolutely impossible.</p>
<p>So we’re dealing with a degree of separation between mathematics and<br>
philosophy that would have astonished most of our great classical or<br>
modern ancestors, many of whom, and some of the most famous ones,<br>
I should point out, were also great mathematicians. Descartes was a<br>
foundational mathematician, the inventor of analytic geometry, which<br>
is a sort of unification of geometry and algebra: he showed how a curve<br>
in space, hence a geometric object, can be represented by an equation.<br>
Leibniz was a mathematical genius, the founder of modern differential<br>
and integral calculus. The last ones who even came close to them lived<br>
sometime in the nineteenth century: perhaps Frege, perhaps<br>
Dedekind, perhaps Cantor in some respects, or Poincaré, who was<br>
certainly the last great figure of that particular model.</p>

<p>His one mention of category theory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, as it turned out, these three logical styles are useful, or even<br>
necessary, in certain branches of mathematics. To be sure, mainstream<br>
mathematics always operates within classical logic. But in the context<br>
of so-called Category theory, which is roughly the theory of relations<br>
“in general,” with no pre-specification of given objects, paraconsistent<br>
logic is clearly operative. In certain categories similar to set<br>
mathematics, such as Topoi theory (a topos is a category in which can<br>
be defined a relation similar to the classical relation of belonging, the<br>
famous ∈), the logic is essentially intuitionistic. Finally, the logical<br>
context has in its turn become variable and no longer imposes<br>
immutable laws on the mind, even in mathematics. Philosophy has<br>
known this for quite some time: in the Hegelian system, the negation<br>
of negation is not at all identical to the original affirmation. Its logic is<br>
therefore nonclassical. In my own system, the logic of pure being, of<br>
being qua being, is classical, the logic of appearing is intuitionistic, and<br>
the logic of the event and of the truths dependent on it is<br>
paraconsistent in terms of the Subject.</p>

<p>He just thinks that mathematics holds a lot of ideas and methods that philosophers should know.   </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I’d like for us to explore in greater detail the links between philosophy and mathematics. You mentioned a moment ago that they were an old couple. Plato had already inscribed over the entrance to his Academy: “Let no one ignorant of geometry enter here.” How would you account for this close association?</em></p>
<p>Mathematics and philosophy have indeed been connected right from their beginnings, even to the point where a variety of particularly famous philosophers – Plato, but also Descartes, Spinoza, Kant, and Searle – categorically declared that without mathematics there would have been no philosophy. So mathematics was conceived of very early on – and entirely explicitly in Plato’s case – as a sort of precondition in order for rational philosophy to come into being. Why? Simply because mathematics exemplified a knowledge process that “held up on its own,” so to speak. In other words, when you’ve got a proof, well, you’ve got a proof! This is nothing like when truth is proclaimed by a priest, a king, or a god. The priest, the king, or the god is right because they’re a priest, a king, or a god. What’s more, if you disagree with them, they’ll let you know about it … Whereas for mathematicians it’s completely different: they have to construct a knowledge process that will be shown to their colleagues and rivals. And if their proof is false, they’ll be told so.</p>
<p>So from very early on, from the time of ancient Greece, mathematics was a world in which things considered to be true, to be proven, could circulate provided they were validated and accepted by the community of people who were “knowledgeable about it,” and not just because of the authority stemming from the mathematician’s calling himself a “mathematician.” On the contrary, the mathematician was somebody who, for the first time, introduced a universality completely free of any mythological or religious assumptions and that no longer took the form of a narrative but of a proof. Truth based on a narrative is “traditional” truth, of a mythological or revealed type. Mathematics swept aside all the traditional narratives: the proof depended only on a rational demonstration, shown to everyone and refutable in its very principle, so that someone who had put forward a hypothesis that was ultimately proved to be false had to accept that he was wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>When did this capitulation, this “separation” between mathematics and philosophy, occur in historical terms?</em></p>
<p>In my opinion, there was a turning point that began in the late<br>
nineteenth century, a turning point that I would term antiphilosophical in a certain way, with brilliant personalities like Nietzsche or Wittgenstein, big stars whose genius I acknowledge but who moved philosophy’s agenda in a direction that had not been its direction since Plato. In particular, it was they who abandoned the idea that the comprehensive and systematic nature of philosophy had to be accepted, and this resulted in the risk of an indifference to mathematics. In my view, this rupture is especially serious in that the mathematics in use from the late nineteenth century on was in fact mathematics that drastically changed many things in the most essential philosophical concepts.</p>
<p><em>Could you give us an example?</em></p>
<p>I’ll focus on the concept of infinity, its history, and the contemporary state of the question and its consequences. On this issue alone, breathtakingly new and important research has been carried out in mathematics over the past fifty years. If you’re not familiar with it, what happens is that, when you say the word “infinity,” you actually have no idea what you’re talking about, because the mathematicians have worked on this concept and taken it to an unprecedented degree of complexity. If you don’t know anything about certain theorems from the 1970s or 1980s on the new figures of mathematical infinity, there’s no point in using the word “infinity” – at least in the context of rational thought.</p>
<p>Likewise, in philosophy “logic” continues to be spoken about, but if you don’t take a close look at what has been going on in logic in terms of its constant formal re-creation, you’ll have a poor and false understanding of the word “logic.” In fact, logic, or rather logics, have become part of mathematics today. I’ll come back to this. But it’s clear that philosophers cannot be unaware of logic, and therefore of mathematized logic today.</p>
<p>These two examples show that philosophy, if it separates from mathematics, heads for disaster, since a considerable number of the concepts it needs become, simply as a result of ignorance, obsolete.</p>

<p>I would have asked him which results about infinity from the 1970s and 1980s he's talking about, to see if he's just bluffing.   The independence of the continuum hypothesis was shown in 1963, so he'd have to be talking about more advanced stuff.   Elsewhere he mentions the work of Woodin, so maybe he means something like that -  but I don't know that work very well, and I'd feel bad if there's really "no point in using the word "infinity"" without knowing that stuff.</p>

<p>Yes, or even an old Badiou.  How old is Badiou?  Oh, 88.   Maybe I'll let him off the hook and not email him and tell him to study category theory.    I hope this book of his encourages young philosophers to study math.   They will then inevitably meet category theory, at least if they use social media.</p>

<p>By the way, this passage from Wikipedia makes Badiou sound like a bullshitter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>L'Être et l'Événement</em> (English: <em>Being and Event</em>) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy">philosophy</a> book by Alain Badiou, published in January 1988 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89ditions_du_Seuil">Éditions du Seuil</a>.  It uses mathematical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory">set theory</a> in its reasoning, using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory">Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_hypothesis">continuum hypothesis</a> extensively.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I guess I just don't believe you can use the ZF axioms extensively to good effect in this sort of book.</p>

<p>But philosophy has always been concerned about the problem of the<br>
multiplicity of languages, since it can always wonder: “What does my<br>
thinking owe to this language that is particular? Doesn’t the<br>
particularity of a language make my supposedly universal discourse<br>
less universal than it aspires to be?” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>this sounds to me a lot like stuff we talk about here.. in terms of "models of a theory", or Galois theory, Kleinian geometry etc. But i'm wondering what is the philosophy jargon for what Badiou is saying here? Is it one of those words like "ontology"? (i can never remember what this means...)</p>

<p>In philosophy, ontology is the study of what sorts of things "exist", and more fundamentally what it <em>means</em> to "exist" or "be".   "Onto-" is a Greek root meaning "being".</p>
<p>I don't think that's the main thing Badiou is addressing here, though there's been a big discussion in philosophy about how our ontology depends on the language we're using, and how <em>much</em> it depends.   Here he seems to be pointing us to the more general issue of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity">linguistic relativity</a>.</p>

<p>Here's André Weil taking "metaphysics" in a certain way that's more adequate for mathematics: <a href="http://denise.vella.chemla.free.fr/transc-Weil-metaphysique-1960.pdf">De la métaphysique aux mathématiques</a>.</p>

<p>André Weil says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Les lois non écrites de la mathématique moderne interdisent,<br>
en effet, de publier des vues métaphysiques de cette espèce. Sans doute est-ce mieux<br>
ainsi ; autrement on serait accablé d’articles encore plus stupides, sinon plus inutiles,<br>

indeed, the publication of metaphysical views of this kind. It is doubtless better this way; otherwise we would be overwhelmed with articles even more stupid, if not more useless,<br>
