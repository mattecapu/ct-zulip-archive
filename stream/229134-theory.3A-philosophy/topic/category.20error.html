<p>The word "category" has unfortunately been quite commonly adopted in academic jargon, sometimes in ways that are hard to relate to the sense of the word in which we use it here. However, the expression 'category error', referring to a misapplication of a word or a misunderstanding of the concept to which a word/phrase refers, could actually bridge the gap. For example, if I have two categories have the same objects but different morphisms, I might accidentally take a product or other construction in the wrong category, and this is a very concrete example of a category error (in both senses of that phrase!)<br>
Abstracting this, in situation when we can think of a property or concept as a construction (an object, morphism, limit...) in or on a particular category, a category error consists precisely of a mistake about which category is being referred to, and so drawing an erroneous conclusion or performing an erroneous calculation. I don't know the extent to which this can give new insights, but I found it satisfying to realise.</p>

<p>I think I more or less see your point but I also feel like I'm missing a big chunk of it. Can you give me a bit more context to better understand it?</p>

<p>I should come up with some actual category theory examples; it's hard to find ones where the arrows aren't trivial. Suppose I consider the collection of roads in a city as a category (there might be one-way systems, so not necessarily a groupoid), the <em>city-map category</em>. If a tourist asks me for directions to a particular landmark, my response will correspond to a morphism from my current position to their proposed destination.<br>
However, there are a bunch of category errors that could occur in this situation, especially if the tourist is a non-native speaker of English or a child. They could ask me directions to something intangible (eg "love"), to an ambiguous location (eg "the museum"), to a place such as "the university" which doesn't really denote a specific building/position (eg if someone in the centre of Cambridge asked "which way to the university?", the answer would be "it's all around you"). In each case, they still expect the answer to have the same form, of a morphism in the city-map category, and this is the category error.</p>

<p>Ok, so roughly the idea would be that there are two categories at play: </p>
<ol>
<li>A "real world category" modelling whatever you want to model</li>
<li>A "fake world category" which looks very similar to the first apparently, but it's not, and it's wrongly modelling whatever you want to model</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>You think you are querying 1, but you are actually querying 2.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finding a category error in a philosophical argument is quite a serious charge. It would be indeed interesting if this could shown to be related to the notions of category from CT.</p>

<p>I think it's difficult to model categorically this phenomenon... The point being exactly that "I'm in structure A, I think I'm in structure B, structure A and B are not compatible"</p>

<p>Still, basically all categorical concepts (functors, ...) are create with the precisely opposite intent of preserving structure</p>

<p>It helps when there is a concrete relationship between the categories to refer to. So we might have a category of concrete objects (with a definite location, say) which embeds into a larger category of objects, including abstract ones. Then a category error arises from the inability to extend a gadget defined on the first category (the "location" property) along the inclusion into the second category.</p>

<p>It happens very often when category A has the same objects of category B. So you get really confused. Anyone who has worked in categories of complete lattices can confirm that!</p>

<p>That's why some people like to use different names for the objects of different categories even though they are "the same".  E.g. frames and locales.</p>

<p>Catarina on Twitter informed me it was not recorded. (other than as the written document). That, I guess, constitutes a refutation object.</p>
