<p>Yes!   <em>Reapings and Sowings</em> is arrogant and self-centered, and it begins to show signs of the madness that seems to have later overtaken him.   Nonetheless this passage helps me understand how Grothendieck had the energy to repeatedly tear up the foundations of algebraic geometry and start again.</p>

<p>SFF is the foundation of Jann Tallinn, who made a lot of money on Skype. I'm not aware that he has any connection to Grothendieck. He's influenced by the rationalist/AI safety movement, which certainly contains some people who know Grothendieck's math, but their politics are not so close together other than evincing a dedication to avoiding everyone dying.</p>

<p>I guess another way to reframe my question, is I think you can see in that essay evidence of him wanting to give up on society and live on a farm.</p>
<p>And folks worried about this might've tried to talk him down by responding to that essay, by earnestly addressing his points and concerns carefully. I'm interested in those responses.</p>
<p>I think Grothendieck touched on a problem, but didn't have a solution (from what I saw in that essay anyways).</p>

<p>The well-known correspondence of Grothendieck in his later decades were with people like Quillen who were just talking about math. Grothendieck did indeed give up on society for the whole last half-century of his life and I don't think there was anyone who could have plausibly talked him out of it, nor am I aware of anyone who published anything aimed at doing so.</p>

<p>I think the question of "should one give up on the fallen world" is bigger and older than Grothendieck. I don't particularly see his decision to do so as that particular to him over any number of other such hermits over the millennia.</p>

<p>I don't think it's so bad for people to go live on a farm, and it's easy for me to imagine wanting to do it.  (I don't at all want to do it: it's just easy to <em>imagine</em>.)    </p>
<p>Unfortunately Grothendieck tried to live on only dandelion soup until his neighbors helped cook him some other food.   So he was not cut out to be a farmer.  </p>
<p>Also he retreated into solitude and, arguably, went nuts.   I think very few people can withstand long periods of solitude well.</p>

<p>There are plenty of people sick of features of our modern existence, or afraid of collapse, who turn to farming.   I don't think it's "giving up" - in fact it's hard as hell!    If I ever decide to "give up" I'll live off my savings and order take-out.</p>
<p>But I think farming works best with a community.    And if you're going to be really honest about self-sufficiency, you need someone in the community who makes the tools, etc.</p>

<p>Oh the "give up" is a personal comment, with respect to myself, given what I know about what I find interesting and what I'm good at.</p>
<p>That is I agree with your point that Grothendieck should never have been a farmer, that life choice was an artifact of something bad.</p>
<p>Maybe it's as general as "he had poor mental health which drove him into isolation", but I genuinely worry there's a deep risk in carelessly judging modern technical solutions as bad or dangerous, even if a specific argument of that sort was true.</p>

<p>Grothendieck didn't have the knowledge or community support to help him succeed in becoming a farmer, nor really the motivation to build the knowledge base or community.

<p>One thing about farming is that today's methods of farming heavily relies on our industrial society for inputs, such as fertilizers, pesticides, GMOs, tractors, et cetera. I don't know if Grothendieck was willing to deal with all that in farming with the views he had towards the end of the life.</p>

Very few people visited him afterward <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Grothendieck#cite_note-Rivka#-73">[71]</a>.

<p>I don’t think this is true very broadly at all. It’s probably at least modestly correlated to the truth that better old ideas are less likely to die out than worse ones. But all kinds of new fashions break down Chesterton’s fences all the time, and it can take a long time or forever to notice the problem.</p>

<p>The point your saying makes sense to me, so if it's important to us to rebuild a Chesterson's fence how should we go about it?</p>
<p><em>This ended up with me thinking through my thoughts on this and ending somewhere that I think is consistent with your advice to engage with the community, so you don't need to read it if you aren't interested</em></p>
<p>When I try this, I almost always take a historical perspective.</p>
<p>Here's a specific example I've thought a bit about lately</p>
<p>I think modern French curves are paths of certain linkages, because that's what their inventor Ludwig Burmester (1840 - 1927) studied.</p>
<p>I'm suspicious these guides buried Durer's insight that it was helpful to classify general curves, by thinking of them as stitched up with segments of spirals. His book on drawing starts with a ton of spiral constructions (here's a beautiful example: <a href="https://archive.org/details/vnderweysungderm00drer/page/n12/mode/1up">https://archive.org/details/vnderweysungderm00drer/page/n12/mode/1up</a>). I don't know how I would prove Durer had this motivation.</p>
<p>But the french curves at least had the advantage that you didn't have to know how to draw first to use them.</p>
<p>But now, a modern spline library Spiro, classifies a very interesting set of curves by thinking of them as segments of <em>clothoids</em>. And it relates this practice to the much older technique of using duck splines to place a strip of wood.</p>
<p>I love this thesis (<a href="https://levien.com/phd/phd.html">https://levien.com/phd/phd.html</a>) I'm suspicious it saved and reintroduced an old idea with a modern twist, that ultimately consolidated different curve making approaches, that ends up being practical in a modern setting in ways that couldn't be practical in the old world.</p>
<p>I want much more of this, so I think about what went well with this. My argument that the chesterson fence was repaired has so many gaps, because I don't know how to rebuild the old mindsets that motivated the old solutions. I think a chesterson fence was fixed here, but I'm not sure how to tell XD. </p>
<p>Historically folks would actually solve problems and pretend they were historical. In this framing it almost sounds like they thought they discovered a chesterson's fence, but really they actually moved their subject forward. How do I know I'm not similarly confused?</p>
<p>I guess the suggested solution here was simply to engage with the thesis's solution earnestly if I think it's cool. As well as with historians who are interested in similar subjects.</p>
<p>i.e. engage with the community.</p>

<p>I got curious about this, and other things, and started reading this book, which is free online:</p>
<ul>
<li>Winfried Scharlau, <em><a href="https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~leila.schneps/grothendieckcircle/Spirituality.html">Who Is Alexandre Grothendieck? Anarchy, Mathematics, Spirituality, Solitude: Volume 3: Spirituality (1970-1991)</a></em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Chapter 20 quotes Grothendieck as writing this at the end of 1985:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As for me, I live a tranquil little life in the country, very retired, and cultivate a garden in the company of a little black cat. I see very few people, and I especially enjoy busying myself with my activities in solitude.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, he cultivated a garden at least.     From January 1985:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For the last week there has been a very unusual cold wave - temperatures of -15 and lower, and when the wind blows off the Mont Ventoux (the name says it all! ) it gets even colder. It seems that this cold wave is raging more or less everywhere in the world (according to someone who has listened to the news), and that in the Midi this has not happened since the famous winter and spring of 1956. During my childhood in Germany I experienced cold snaps like this, but then there was also snow, which protected the earth and added a note of softness to the air and objects. In this frigid cold with no snow, the surface of the earth is frozen like a block of ice. The garden was ruined within a few days - I don't know if anything that I sowed and planted will remain when the spring arrives.</p>

<p>Though I am not entirely clear what this thread is about, as it seems to be broken off from a large thread that would give context, it does seem that leaving the mainstream culture because it's destroying life on Earth is a big theme.  I think this is a great thing to do, and if you aspire to actually <em>make things better</em> rather than merely discontinuing your participation in <em>making things worse</em> (which btw is still praiseworthy), you'll want to do it with other people in a <strong>community which is centered around ascertaining how to go about making things better</strong>.</p>
<p>"Let Me Think" was my attempt to try out creating such a community myself.  Now I have joined such a community that others have created, called the <a href="https://www.monasticacademy.org/">Monastic Academy for the Preservation of Life on Earth</a>.  I intend to go on living in such communities.</p>

<p>The original thread was here:</p>
<p><a href="#narrow/stream/229134-theory.3A-philosophy/topic/Book.2Fcourse.20recommendations.20for.20managing.20.22Scientism.22.3F/near/532947191">https://categorytheory.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/229134-theory.3A-philosophy/topic/Book.2Fcourse.20recommendations.20for.20managing.20.22Scientism.22.3F/near/532947191</a></p>
<p>Maintaining a relationship with the mathematics community was suggested as a way to keep ones math ideas from getting too weird. I wanted to explore Grothendieck's relationship with the math community as a point of reference for understanding and contextualizing that advice. That discussion was split off into this thread.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277352">@Alex Kreitzberg</span> -  For most people, it is very dangerous to spend a long time working on mathematics without seeking confirmation of their ideas from the general community of mathematicians.</p>
<p>However, I know don't anyone who argues (now) that Grothendieck's math ideas became too weird when he stopped communicating with experts on math.   His work on <em>dessins d'enfants</em> and his huge books <em>Pursuing Stacks</em>, <em>The Long March to Galois Theory</em>, and <em>Derivators</em> have become very important.   It's his other ideas that people say are too weird.  For example, his friend the great mathematician Pierre Cartier <a href="http://xahlee.info/math/i/Alexander_Grothendieck_cartier.pdf">wrote</a>, while Grothendieck was still alive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most worrisome symptom is his obsession with the Devil. According to his most recent visitors, he, who never theologized his religion, has plunged into the writing of a sermon on the Devil’s action in our world (he always was obsessional about writing!) His “catastrophism” is by no means new, and his concerns about the terrors of global nuclear war and pollution came at the right time in the 1970’s. More recently, there was the incident mentioned earlier where, like Paco Rabanne, he received a revelation of the date of the end of the world, and he made it quite clear that it was going to be the end of “everything”, not just our little Earth. Out of charity, he communicated this date to 200 or 300 people drawn from his list of scientific correspondents, and exhorted them to repentance before the final explosion, for afterwards, there would remain but a few chosen. That letter, which received no response, was followed by a gloomy retraction after the fatidic date.</p>
