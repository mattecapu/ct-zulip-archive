<p>There's a two-culture tension in the reception of Peirce these days.  Maybe it's always been that way but it strikes me as more bifurcated today than any time since I began my Peirce studies 50+ years ago.  Peirce for the logic-math-science researcher and Peirce for the humanities-literary-verbal stylist are almost immiscible types of thinkers.  I find this especially irksome in the case of Peirce  since I have felt from the beginning Peirce more than any other thinker gave us the framework and the tools we need to integrate the two-culture divide in society at large.</p>

I've recently become exposed to Deleuze in a completely different context, and I've been waiting for somebody in the humanities to take a serious look at the nature of diagrammatic reasoning as a fundamental question for philosophy.</p>

<p>yes, I have also been waiting for a book like this. In fact now that you mention it, Deleuze did talk about diagrams (eg. searching, I just found this <a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/deleuze-and-the-diagram-9781441115607/">Deleuze and the Diagram</a>) and gave them a central role. At the time when I listened to a few of his lectures,  I knew too little about Category Theory, especially about diagrams, to know if there was a formal/serious relation, or if these words were just accidentally the same.  But this book is certainly making the case for it being serious, and indeed that would also have been my guess for the simple reason that Mathematics in France has nearly a religious standing, so that it is hardly possible for a great philosopher to not be listening carefully to the breakthroughs happening in mathematics.</p>
<p>So that then makes me wonder if Deleuze's book on <a href="https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/the-fold">Folds</a> could have been inspired by catamorphisms.... (I guess I should read some of them to find out).</p>

<p>Dear Avi, Henry,</p>
<p>Diagrams are a mixed bag, a complex and polymorphic species, in Peircean semiotics. &nbsp; All diagrams in common use, especially in mathematics, involve all three types of signs — Symbols, Icons, Indices — as interpreted by their user communities.&nbsp; There has been a tendency in recent years to overemphasize the iconic aspects of Peirce’s <a href="https://oeis.org/wiki/Logical_Graphs">logical graphs</a>, reading them a bit too much on the analogy of venn diagrams, but their real conceptual and computational power comes rather from their generic symbolic character.</p>

<p>I guess one paper I really like and keep citing is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00526">Knowledge Representation in Bicategories of Relations</a> which shows how regular and geometric logic can be modelled as something pretty close to sheaves, namely functors from bicategories of relations to Rel (the category of Sets and <strong>Relations</strong>).  That does not give us modal logic, but all of first order logic.  (And the article is presented in terms of string diagrams, but that should not affect the argument).</p>

<p>I skimmed this when you first linked it.  From the perspective of a long-time pursuer of Peirce it is very general and impressionistic but I'm in the process of taking another look and working up a few specific comments.  As far as diagrams go my work for the last half-century has been focused on Peirce's logical graphs, the duality between their so-called <em>entitative</em> and <em>existential</em> interpretations for propositional logic, and their revamping along the lines of Spencer&nbsp;Brown's <em>Laws of Form</em>.</p>

<p>Just by way of explaining my personal orientation, when I first took up an interest in Peirce, as a freshperson in the late 60s, pretty much everyone in my circles of interest intersecting on Peirce intuited how radically different his drumming was from the mainstream dins of the day.&nbsp; These days I see a lot more <em>Resistance Is Futile, You Will Be Assimilated</em> spin on Peirce.&nbsp; So I'm finding it necessary to keep going back to the source and carefully pointing out exactly where the roads diverge.</p>

<p>I'd love it of course if all of Peirce's graphs could be mapped to CT. That would help me integratet that work a lot faster. Or alternatively, if one could work out exactly where it could not be tied into CT, that would also be very helpful. <br>

<p>The way I see it, Peirce’s work as a whole requires us to stand back from our current picture of category theory and adopt a more general perspective on the subject as we know it.&nbsp; That has not been a popular opinion in math circles and scarcely grasped in phil circles.&nbsp; It's on my big bucket list of <em><a href="https://inquiryintoinquiry.com/?s=What+we%27ve+got+here+is+%28a%29+failure+to+communicate">Failures To Communicate</a></em> but I haven't really tried all that hard lately so maybe I'll give it another go.</p>

<p>The thing to take away from all this is the common <em>function</em> of category markers as disambiguators of signs or unequivocators of terms.&nbsp; This function is the same through all the diverse systems of categories coming from different thinkers through history.</p>

<p>One of the first things I learned when I turned from scribbling alpha graphs on the backs of computer punch cards to hacking logical graphs on my trusty old TI-99/4A is that planar maps are a death-trap in terms of both conceptual elegance and computational efficiency &mdash; so I switched to the topological dual graphs.&nbsp; This is of course the same thing folks did in the map-coloring domain.</p>

<p>Thanks. That is a nice and faire review, having read the book, and the little criticism is justified. I think it is a very good first step, that hopefully will be elaborated and developed on by others. For me, who knew very little on Spinoza, Peirce and Deleuze it will help me if and when I get to look at them more closely.</p>

<p>Very briefly, Spencer Brown's Revival &mdash; sounds like a great name for a band &mdash; augments Peirce's &alpha;-level logical graphs in two main ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clarifies the <a href="https://inquiryintoinquiry.com/2019/07/09/animated-logical-graphs-17/">relation between primary arithmetic and primary algebra</a>.&nbsp; I usually say this is implicit in Peirce's use of logical graphs but it's fair to say he never quite broke through to making it explicit.&nbsp; Understanding this relationship is extremely important &mdash; it clears up worries about the &ldquo;ontological status of variables&rdquo; (a phrase I got from Quine, I think) and dispenses with the mechanics of substitution as a fundamental notion, replacing it with principles of syntactic analogy.</li>
<li>Facilitates the use of equational inference rules <a href="https://inquiryintoinquiry.com/2021/02/18/double-negation-2/">(1)</a> <a href="https://inquiryintoinquiry.com/2020/08/22/animated-logical-graphs-37/">(2)</a>.&nbsp;  This is a major advance in so far as equational reasoning pervades mathematics but gets short shrifft in traditional approaches to logic.</li>

<p>I'd be very interested in the comments of people who know about Peirce of the two chapters in the Book <a href="#narrow/stream/229134-philosophy/topic/Peirce/near/243321300">"Diagrammatic Immanence"</a> I linked to above on "3. Peirce" and "4. Diagrams of Variation: Functor Categories and Presheaves". <br>
The chapter on Presheaves has some good intuitions on how to explain them that I recognise from studying them a year ago. At the end of that chapter the author  <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="318643">Rocco Gangle</span>  argues that Peirce's diagrams can be modelled in terms of Category Theory. I would have expected a long list of articles to follow to underwrite that claim. Perhaps this is all well known in Peirce or CT circles,...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Things are a little calmer in my neck of the woods at the moment so I’m paddling back up Peirce Bayou to clear up some of the points I missed during last week’s tempest and root canal.&nbsp; An hour’s expedition through Amazon’s creeks and tributaries finally turned up a pearl of not too great a price so far as <em>Diagrammatic Immanence</em> goes so I tumbled for a paperback edition to arrive in a couple of weeks but the purchase lets me read it on Kindle right away.&nbsp; So I’ll be perusing that &hellip;</p>

As I am trying to get “frame sync” on this discussion, as the satellite communications people say, I am taking clues from the introduction to the listing for Gangle's <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Diagrammatic_Immanence/bjVYDwAAQBAJ">Diagrammatic Immanence</a>.</p>
<p>&lt;QUOTE Edinburgh University Press&gt;<br>
A renewal of immanent metaphysics through diagrammatic methods and the tools of category theory. Spinoza, Peirce and Deleuze are, in different ways, philosophers of immanence.  Rocco Gangle addresses the methodological questions raised by a commitment to immanence in terms of how diagrams may be used both as tools and as objects of philosophical investigation.  He integrates insights from Spinozist metaphysics, Peircean semiotics and Deleuze's philosophy of difference in conjunction with the formal operations of category theory.  Category theory reveals deep structural connections among logic, topology and a variety of different areas of mathematics, and it provides constructive and rigorous concepts for investigating how diagrams work.<br>
&lt;/QUOTE&gt;&lt;/QUOTE&gt;</p>
<p>This discussion keeps flashing me back to an unfinished syzygy from the mid '80s when I took a course on “applications of λ-calculus” with <a href="https://www.news-gazette.com/obituaries/john-gray/article_fb2520a5-d6c4-5087-9ac1-ed6613823b9a.html">John Gray</a> at Illinois examining the trio of combinators, computation, and cartesian closed categories, all hot topics of the day, and followed it up with a guided study on the connections to Peirce I had glimpsed at the time.&nbsp; I'll dig up some notes and get back to that.&nbsp; For the moment I'll focus on category theory in the light of Peirce.&nbsp; The lights of Spinoza and Deleuze I'll leave to observers who see better by them.</p>

<p>yes, it's quite a feat to cover all three philosophers and do CT too.<br>
But luckily one can criticise smaller pieces of the work :-)</p>
