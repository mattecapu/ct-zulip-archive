<p>Intuitively, I would think that the difference is on the lines of: <br>
mathematics is one of few disciplines that are entirely defined by their methodology, not at all by their subject of study;<br>
in a certain sense it belongs better together with the “performing arts”, ie one “performs maths” the way one “performs music” or “performs dance”;</p>
<p>with philosophical logic/foundations/philosophy of maths being to maths as music theory is to music, which is why it is somewhat at the boundary (it may incorporate the performance of maths but not always).</p>
<p>I'm sure that someone has already expressed this thought better than I am now...</p>

<p>A discipline which is defined by its subject is “open” in the sense that it can possibly incorporate all sorts of “performances” as long as they are related to the subject.<br>
With a discipline which is defined by methodology/performance, you may push the boundaries of what “counts” as a performance (like ready-mades counting as art...) but you cannot cross the boundaries between different performing arts. Like, you will never be able to sell a musical <em>performance</em> as maths (at most the piece of music, eg if you're Xenakis...)</p>

<p>The other examples of “performing arts” that I can think of in the sciences, beside “mathematics”, would be</p>
<ul>
<li>“building” (including programming) -- theory is engineering+design,</li>
<li>“experimentation” -- theory is statistics+philosophy of science,</li>
<li>“argumentation” -- theory is logic+rhetoric.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly like there are “professional mathematicians” there are also “professional builders” and “professional arguers”, so these are arguably also disciplines like maths is, but I don't think there's such a thing as “professional experimenters”.</p>

<p>To get a lot of twitter hits, if you're an academic, slam an entire field by saying something like "mathematics is culturally "closed world" - there is a fixed-for-all-time list of things that "count" as mathematics. Whereas computer science is culturally "open world"."</p>

<p>But <em>why</em> would you shortchange a performance by doing that? Maths doesn't sell, as much as some would hope otherwise. If it did, people would be scalping tickets to lectures, not concerts.</p>
<p>In any case, this linkage of performance with maths reminds me of this <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-64444-8">book</a>, which is book II of Mazzola's newly expanded <em>The Topos of Music</em>.</p>

<p>I mostly agree, I would just point out that classifying it as a compound of math and experimentation is probably more simplistic than helpful. A bit more nuanced characterization is that science is a dialectic of model building--prediction generation--experimental testing (which then feeds back to the model). Quasi-fixed points of this feedback loop are often called theories in science. Mathematics is used throughout the process as a language mediating this dialectic mostly because it imposes some sort of internal logical coherence.</p>

<p>No, we're not. By "science", I mean a systematic study of something using the scientific method. Despite the replication crisis, there's lots of good work done in good faith to study the social realm. Arguably, it's still about the natural world, but the social realm is more of a layer on top of that, and incorporates "non-natural" entities like ideas.</p>

<p>Depending on how you define a "counterfactual world", there are things you can study about that world that can be done using the scientific method. If you accept that MMORPGs are counterfactual worlds, then people have studied the economics of those worlds, for example. It's not "really just maths", since these studies would usually involve observation and experimentation as well.</p>

<p>Yup, and it can in fact be applied to a counterfactual world that's amenable to that process: that's how you could do maths in a counterfactual world, which is implicit in your observation that "there is probably a version of this dialectic internal to mathematics". </p>
<p>I don't think that process is unique to science: creating a good narrative could be modelled by that as well. This is why you can have bad instances of narrative: the author has simply generated predictions (the narrative) that haven't been properly tested (exposed to a suitably critical audience to gauge their reaction) yet.</p>

<p>So Amar had a couple of tweets on the topic he raised here that I'd like to discuss. Let's start with "<a href="https://twitter.com/amar_hh/status/1272611839411662849">a calculation starting with 0=1 is still mathematics</a>":</p>
<p>Under classical logic, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_explosion">principle of explosion</a> means every calculation that starts with a contradiction like 0=1 is clearly not mathematics, because the concept of truth or falsity has become trivial. Even if you weaken the contradiction, and say that "0=1" means you're talking about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_with_one_element">field with one element</a>, that took a lot of work to set up.</p>

<p>And that's the thing that's bothering me: Amar wants to assert that a counterfactual world is somehow necessarily inconsistent (or maybe paraconsistent). That's not the case, however: any sufficiently interesting counterfactual world, even for artistic purposes, is internally consistent. Assuming that "counterfactual =&gt; inconsistent" trivialises the work of so many people who work hard to build counterfactual worlds</p>

If your counterfactual world is inconsistent (e.g. assume the bare contradiction 0=1 and proceed from there), of course it's "just" an experiment, because perhaps your way of "doing a blood count" involves doing something that may be consistent with "the real world", but is inconsistent with the counterfactual world.

<p><a href="https://www.hpsst.com/uploads/6/2/9/3/62931075/bunge__1991__science___pseudoscience.pdf">This paper</a> by Mario Bunge opens with a more nuanced definition of the content of science, and may be of interest. The rest of the article lacks some context, but is an entertaining read nonetheless. I would observe that his definition lends support to the point <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276424">@Rongmin Lu</span> made about it being defined by its methodology.</p>
<p>On <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276363">@Amar Hadzihasanovic</span>'s original "hot take": I don't really understand why you separate out 'experimenters' in your list on the basis that any experimental science is specialised.  The same is surely true for the other subjects you specified: the idea that professional mathematicians are "mathematicians in general", for example, is a misconception. Sure, someone with mathematical training will be able to pick up an unfamiliar topic faster than someone without that training, but similarly someone with experience in one lab setting will adapt faster to new lab settings. In either case further training is required.</p>

<p>And in reverse, it is not unconceivable that we could have degrees in “experimental science”, and a culture of people who identify themselves as “experimenters” in the way that we identify as mathematicians. They would share an aesthetics of “beautifully designed experiments”, ones that best get rid of confounding factors, biases, various kinds of errors, etc. <br>
And labs could hire an “experimenter” who is not necessarily a specialist of the field, just someone who is good at consulting on whether an experiment is 'actually' going to prove/disprove what the specialists want it to, and suggest how to improve it.</p>

<p>For example, at Macquarie University in Sydney, which is the HQ of Australian CT, quite a few CT people were actually hired to the CS department there, before shifting over to the maths department. There's also at least one CS person who does a lot of CT and is still in the CS department. It's really a function of curation, as someone else had mentioned on Twitter. If you've published mostly in CS venues, the natural places to hire you are CS departments. I don't think there's anything bad about that, and I don't think it justifies the "two worlds" take.</p>

And my argument is partly that this discussion can't be separated from the identities of the people who consider themselves to be doing those subjects, which is why you end up with people identifying themselves "as a physical mathematician, not as a mathematical physicist.”</p>

<p>This is partly about methods, and partly because "physicist" is an insult amongst certain mathematical circles. Actually, the two are intertwined: a physicist is allegedly fond of indulging in "non-rigorous" reasoning, and so is an object of ridicule amongst some mathematical circles in the past. So the difference between the two is that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The physical mathematician is a mathematician who does rigorous maths inspired by physics.</li>
<li>The mathematical physicist is a physicist who applies a lot of sophisticated mathematics to study physics, but may resort to "physical" reasoning.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the record, I don't think that any of these distinctions in self-identification is silly. I have identified in many different ways over the years. Only that they are extremely “intensional” and not “extensional” distinctions, to use CS jargon: it may be impossible to distinguish a mathematical physicist from a physical mathematician just by observation.</p>

<p>Yeah, and I was critiquing the "knowing it is coca cola" bit when I said you're asserting that a counterfactual world is necessarily inconsistent.<br>
In the real world, running a blood count on coca cola is not science. That isn't controversial.<br>
What I disagreed with is your assumption that in a counterfactual world, where coca cola <em>is</em> fairy blood, that the "you" in the counterfactual world would "know" that it is coca cola, and that thereby running a "blood count" (in the sense of that counterfactual world) is "not science".</p>

<p>That is what I was critiquing.

<p>I'll try to rephrase what I mean again. Maybe it's not a very standard use of counterfactual. When I say “an experiment about a counterfactual world” it does NOT mean:<br>
“an experiment on something which turns-out-to-not-be-actually-real-in-the-real-world-whatever-that-means”<br>
it's<br>
“a make-believe experiment, based on what I believe to be false, from which I do not expect to learn anything”.<br>
And I would say that the latter is not science. But it's <em>entirely</em> relative to the state of mind of the experimenter and, as all such things, can be misread by observers.<br>
For example a fraud mystic running a séance with the idea of faking contact with the deceased is not a “scientific experiment”, but may be misread as one by the victims of the fraud.</p>

<p>By the way I think it's ok to deal with some counterfactuals as a way of (hopefully) getting knowledge about the real world. One example would be studying anti-de Sitter space in string theory even if you believe, or know, that we are not in anti-de Sitter space: it's still science because you plan to learn things that you can then transfer to our universe.</p>

<p>Nope. What's inconsistent about the definition that "an experiment about a counterfactual world" means "“a make-believe experiment, based on what I believe to be false, from which I do not expect to learn anything” is that the "I" is doing an experiment while holding a belief that is in conflict with the premise of the experiment. That's the inconsistency.</p>

<p>I have to say I'm a little confused too. If homeopaths believe that what they are doing is science, that makes it so?<br>
And on the flip side, if someone performs an experiment that disproves the existence of something they had thought was real (eg the existence of the ether), was everything they did leading up to that point no longer science?</p>

<p>If a hoax is presented/supported using scientific methods, the fraud lies in the falsification of the results of experiments. Whenever pseudoscience is approached with an unbiased scientific method, it either becomes self-defeating (the phenomenon is consistently disproven) or a genuine underlying cause for the apparent success of the pseudoscience is identified.</p>

<p>How and why do you want to classify what a word or concept refers to without defining it? That is, why do you feel justified in marking out what "is" and "isn't" science when you're avoiding stating what you are interpreting science to mean? This is a Category Theory forum, definitions are pretty important to a lot of people here!</p>
<p>I personally subscribe (for the most part) to Bunge's definition of what (a) science is, as described in the article I linked earlier, which explicitly excludes pseudoscience, notably of the kind you are describing as fraudulent. It is not purely performative, in that it is required to include <em>up-to-date</em> knowledge and well-defined principles, and its description includes the community of people involved in its study. I would be interested to hear what you think of his take, actually, since we've moved this conversation to <a class="stream" data-stream-id="229134" href="/#narrow/stream/229134-philosophy">#philosophy</a>.</p>

<p>I think I've been misunderstood. To be very clear, I certainly think that fraudsters and cranks should not be considered to be doing good science -- or good maths either! Does this mean science is a "closed world" culture? Yes, contrary to what you were arguing. But I think I've already argued the initial premise of Jules was not very well-founded.</p>
<p>About fraudsters: What I did say was that <em>successful</em> fraudsters are often perpetuating their fraud using methods that can be said to be developed on a scientific basis, otherwise they wouldn't be successful at all. The fraudsters going about their business using non-scientific methods are relying on luck for their success. The fraudsters that perpetuate fraud using a well-tested system are more likely to succeed.</p>
<p>As for excluding cranks, well, a lot of scientists would certainly agree with that. I don't see why you'd want to take me to task for that. The line between a crank and a fraudster can sometimes be very blurry.</p>

<p>I'm not interested in this maximally inclusive definition, because this discussion was kicked off by an ill-founded notion of what it means for a culture to be "open world" or "closed world". People have long held a "closed world" view of what science should be: it has long excluded "bad science", "pseudoscience" and things that are "not even science".</p>

<p>In that sense, "science" is like "maths". Science, contrary to the argument you've presented, isn't an "open world" culture: in fact, you've already sought to make it a "closed world" by restricting its subject matter to "the real world", while I was pushing for it to include "counterfactual worlds". </p>
<p>You've now shifted the criteria to "intent", or whether a person is doing something in good or bad faith. As Morgan and I have pointed out, that is irrelevant to what science is about. The <em>successful</em> fraudulent mystic in your example would have used methods of a scientific nature to develop a system by which they could successfully defraud their victims. The good-faith believer in homeopathy is not doing science merely because of their good intent: any success can be attributable to the placebo effect, luck, or to the incidental adoption of scientific methods that produce results.</p>
<p>Thus, intent and the nature of the methods being used are two independent issues. You seem to be conflating the two in order to justify the ill-founded notion that "science" and "maths" somehow differ on their "openness". I've already pointed out where that flawed notion arose.</p>

<p>By the way, mathematical physicists have traditionally been in math departments:  in the US, at least, a "mathematical physicist" is a breed of mathematician, despite the way the phrase looks.    </p>
<p>The book <em>Modern Methods in Mathematical Physics</em> sets the tone: it's written by Barry Simon and Michael Reed, both in math departments, and it's full of theorems.  I got my start on mathematical physics with Elliot Lieb and then Irving Segal, both in math departments.   </p>

<p>This makes it very clear for me what science can have in common with arts in your view. I think what you said here is exactly one of the most defining features of contemporary art. What makes art art is, indeed, the artistic purpose. This is why a can of beans is just a can of beans, unless someone (e.g. Warhol) puts it in a gallery, giving it an artistic purpose that makes it art.</p>

<p>Still, the presence of purpose is one of the few things that really 99% of art forms since the first paintings in caves have in common. The Venus of Willendorf had artistic purpose. As Michelangelo's frescoes, as a painting by Borremans, as a performance by Abramovic or Cattelan's banana.</p>

<p>I've heard it, but almost nobody uses it.   Another little-used classification is "theoretical mathematician", proposed by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9307227">Jaffe and Quinn</a> as a way to distinguish rigorous mathematics from the kind of work Witten and others do, using physics to come up with new mathematical ideas.

<p>I don't see the relevance of the "intent" of the practitioner in this conversation, which seems to have been equivocated with the "presence of purpose" in a work of art in your recent comment. The nature of the practitioner's "intent" is very hard to discern and can be feigned, so it is very unhelpful to talk about whether or not something was done with "scientific intent". That's why, when people actually consider what "science" is, a lot of focus is placed on the methods, not on some nebulous and inaccessible internal mental state of the practitioner.</p>

<p>This is the origin of the subsequent disagreement. When I used the word "internal" in the preceding discussion, it was by analogy with what "<a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/internal+logic">internal</a>" means in CT. That is to say, if in a counterfactual world, a "fizzy drink" has been identified with "fairy blood", then it is inconsistent to argue that a "blood test" in that counterfactual world, which presumably will give some sort of result with things of the type "blood", will not give any result with a "fizzy drink" that is identical with 'fairy blood" in that world.</p>

<p>Let's consider a more timely example to illustrate why this is inconsistent. <br>
Suppose travel between parallel Earths is possible and a traveller arrives from another Earth that differs from our Earth by some key political fact, e.g. X isn't the leader of country Y where they're from, but W is. From "our" perspective, the proposition A:= "leader W is the leader of country Y" is a counterfactual; to the traveller, that is a fact on their Earth that has now become a counterfactual upon their arrival on our Earth. <br>
If the traveller were to then assert A, while on our Earth, they would be asserting something inconsistent with the situation on our Earth. If they were to <em>act</em> as in the fairy blood example -- do something to test the truth of not-A, while believing in A and arguing that the results will show A -- their actions would also be judged on our Earth to be incompatible with the internal logic of the situation on our Earth. <br>
That's what I meant by "internally consistent" within the counterfactual world. It does NOT mean taking into account the "internal mental state" of the practitioner at all. It just means respecting the internal logic of the counterfactual world itself.</p>

<p>I particularly liked the letter of Karen Uhlenbeck, who echoes what I think of the original "closed/open world" interpretation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My main criticism of the [Jaffe-Quinn] article is that it draws broad conclusions from too narrow a perspective. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In particular, her criticism of the term "theoretical mathematics" also strikes at the heart of the preceding discussion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have serious objections of another sort to the idea of creating a discipline called "theoretical mathematics". Setting aside the semantics, in the broader context of its description, "theoretical mathematics" already exists. It is called "applied mathematics", a much bigger field than pure mathematics. Applied mathematics is done mostly outside departments of mathematics and draws in far more resources and many broad scientific interests. Only the combined elitism of very pure mathematics and high-energy fundamental physics would claim that its own brand of speculative and applicable mathematical structure should have a special name.</p>

<p>While this is a nice diagram, I'm skeptical of unidirectional flowcharts, because they tend to hide the presence of feedback and iterative actions. An example of a flawed unidirectional flowchart having an adverse effect is the idea that software development should follow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model">waterfall model</a>, which was given a formal description by Winston W Royce in 1970 (ironically enough, to exemplify a <em>flawed, non-working model</em> of software development).

<p>A similar flaw exists in the usual distinction between mathematics and science. In Drexler's diagram, mathematics would take the place of "engineering design": mathematics is supposed to proceed by deduction from theory ("abstract model") to consequences ("useful product"), while science is supposed to proceed by induction from systems to theory.</p>

<p>In reality, of course, the information flow in both maths and science is iterative and bidirectional. <br>
In scientific inquiry, studying systems leads to theories by which we design new experiments to elicit more information about the objects of study and thus more theoretical development. <br>
In mathematical inquiry, different lines of research can sometimes converge when someone observes (by "induction", i.e. postulating new hypotheses from the available results) that a more generalised structure or a system of axioms can subsume current results. Negative theorems can also send us to the drawing board to re-think the definitions of the mathematical objects we're working with.</p>

By an observation of <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="275901">Jules Hedges</span>, these are also open games, so we may think of the practitioner of maths or science as being "Player 1" in a game with a certain "Player 2". Usually, "Player 2" is called the "environment", which is an analogy that works for science, but what is "Player 2" for maths then, without resorting to Platonism?</p>

<p>Here's where I need to refer again to <a href="/user_uploads/21317/1psxskBbtL13yl72Vv7pzKGU/inquiry-design.png">Drexler's diagram</a>. <br>
I've proposed earlier that maths can stand in for "engineering design" in the diagram, because of its emphasis on the deductive process. I should emphasise, once again, that one should not be misled by the diagram into thinking that the process is unidirectional. <br>
Of course, maths does not have, as its goal, the <em>direct</em> creation of useful physical systems. What it does is produce useful <em>theories</em> in service of science. This means we should stack the "engineering design" (aka "maths") diagram on top of the "scientific inquiry" diagram. As a corollary, the "flow of information" arrow along the "scientific inquiry" side now points towards the direction of increasing abstraction.</p>

<p>Going back to the game-semantic interpretation, we may now see that "Player 2" or the "environment" for maths turns out to be... the abstract model itself! In fact, you can stack more "maths" diagrams on top of the "abstract model" module of the original "maths" diagram, which corresponds to the further abstractions that would eventually lead to "pure" mathematics.<br>
Incidentally, this is probably why Platonism seems to be intuitively true to mathematicians, even though it's not well-justified on philosophical grounds. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong">Box's aphorism</a> probably applies here.</p>

<p>Back to the question of this topic: <strong><em>What are maths and science?</em></strong><br>
In terms of what I have discussed above, it's probably not too much of a shock to conclude that <em>mathematics is a science</em>. This echoes what Armand Borel wrote in his <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9404229">letter in response to Jaffe-Quinn's "theoretical mathematics"</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have often maintained, and even committed to paper on some occasions, the view that mathematics is a science, which, in analogy with physics, has an experimental and a theoretical side, but operates in an intellectual world of objects, concepts and tools. Roughly, the experimental side is the investigation of special cases, either because they are of interest in themselves or because one hopes to get a clue to general phenomena, and the theoretical side is the search of general theorems. In both, I expect proofs of course, and I reject categorically a division into two parts, one with proofs, the other without.</p>

<p>I don't quite understand why doing a blood test on coca cola should not be considered science.  Motivation, belief, and good faith of the experimenter don't seem to come into play at all (aside from the social aspect of science, where good faith is important in reporting the results).</p>

<p>The act of performing the experiment, recording the results, and comparing against the expected results sounds to me like science, regardless of the experimenter's a priori beliefs.  How often is history littered with scientific advances where an experiment was accidentally performed, where the best minds of the day "knew" it would be "stupid" to intentionally carry out the experiment?</p>

<p>If the coca cola blood test gave an unexpected result, that would be the basis for further inquiry.  If the coca cola blood test gave the expected result, that would support the prevailing theory.  Either way, the application of the process – intentionally or not – would be an example of science.</p>

<p>Exactly, and we already know one example in our lifetime. The <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2005/7693-the-nobel-prize-in-physiology-or-medicine-2005-2005-6/">2005 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine</a> was given to two Australian doctors, Barry Marshall and Robin Warren, for their work in discovering the role of the bacterium <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> in causing gastritis. This theory was dismissed by all the experts at the time -- everybody "knew" stress was the culprit -- until Barry Marshall ingested the bacteria himself and developed gastritis.</p>

<p>Earlier, it was <a href="#narrow/stream/229134-philosophy/topic/What.20are.20Maths.20and.20Science.3F/near/200911882">asserted</a> that the difference between mathematics and science was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I can do maths about a counterfactual world, I can do dance and paintings about a counterfactual world, but by definition I can't do science about a counterfactual world (unless it's really just maths).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was what motivated the whole "doing a blood test on a fizzy drink" scenario. The argument was that, since the experimenter was "pretending" that a fizzy drink is "fairy blood", then it can't be science. Morgan and I made the same point as you did, and I also pointed out that the counterfactual world being considered is inconsistent.</p>
