<p>In case it needs to be said explicitly, don't forget we are <em>category theorists</em>, we do some of the most genuinely abstract academic theory that exists, this is not something that just anyone can pick up. The very best we can possibly hope for is to not put up any <em>additional</em> barriers. In the end, by the time a person has enough intellectual development to have a chance with categories, they have already been at the mercy of society for 20 years</p>

<p>I know what you mean, Jules, but I'm not sure I totally buy it. There's no objective scale of "abstraction" (whatever that means) and even if there is, it certainly doesn't correlate to a scale of difficulty.  Most (not all) of us probably find category theory much easier than the supposedly more concrete theory of PDEs, for example.  I don't think we should accept that category theory needs to be any more difficult or mysterious than other branches of maths.</p>

<p>About this: there were actually two high school students present today, who approached me some weeks ago because they would like to get some hands on experience in research. They wanted to work on some theoretical problem in TDA, and I kindly redirected them to ACT, as I do think that the abstractness of CT makes the entry point easier, in some way</p>

<p>@ Jules: We can make the ACT community more diverse by broadening the base. This is how I understood what Nina said about not doing positive discrimination and what Jade said against merit based access. Of course, you are right that we can't make math really easy to everybody. Math is fun also because it is hard. But we can improve how we include more who would and could be part of mathematics.</p>

<p>I think we have a lot of work to do in finding ways to present CT at a lower level.  Lawvere and Schanuel's book was a really bold attempt at that (CT for high schoolers); some people like it, others don't. But we're slowly figuring out how to teach CT meaningfully without lots of undergrad courses as prerequisites.  E.g. fifteen years ago there weren't many decent intros to CT (for meathematicians) other than Mac Lane's, which is often seen as rather demanding in terms of  prerequisites. Now there are a whole bunch that assume much less of the reader. It's a gradual process, and everything has to be classroom-tested and tinkered with and tested again, but there's definite progress being made.</p>

<p>I tried teaching category theory to some (students including) undergrads last year in Germany, and I have to say it went pretty well. I wrote the lecture notes almost together with the students (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10642">https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10642</a>), and I think I've learned at least as much as they have. I would be very happy to discuss and compare the experiences with everyone else who has tried :)</p>

<p>I could teach it without those prerequisites, e.g. by starting with lots of categories that are either easy to draw or come from everyday life.   But I would need to spend a lot of my time on it, because no books for that approach exist yet.    I also don't have much practice teaching people who just came out of high school.... <em>except</em> for teaching them calculus, where I have the advantage that the poor students <em>need</em> to take the course, and it's easy to be better than the other professors.</p>

<p>Hello! I am one of the aforementioned high schoolers! Personally, I find that the abstract nature of category theory is actually what draws me to it, but I do agree that the prerequisites necessary for getting a good grasp of category theory are rather inaccessible to most high schoolers. I've had the privilege of being able to access a lot more mathematical resources and receive a lot more guidance than the typical high schooler does, and one of my priorities is finding ways to help make sure more kids, especially those from underrepresented groups, have access to quality math resources to guide their learning. I'm very interested in the conversations about mentorship in this stream, and I would love to talk about that!</p>
<p>(Sorry for taking so long to send this, I am completely new to Zulip and I'm still figuring things out.)</p>

<p>@ Tom Leinster<br>
I am teaching high-school math to my teenage kids now. I try to approach it as if it were research. I get a sense that some topics are more difficult than others. Easier: Combinatorics, Geometry, Algebra, Programming. Difficult: Calculus, Logic. This is a very small sample and it is not clear to me whether there are general lessons to learn from this. But it didn't occur to me to teach them Category Theory ... I would think it is even more on the difficult side. But I am not sure, have to think about it ...</p>

<p>I don't think trying to get math to "do something for you" is particularly helpful at lower levels.  Apparently calculus helps you if you're a farmer trying to make an efficient fence... but does that make people interested in calculus?  Some, maybe, but not because it's truly helpful.</p>

<p>Well you might start with universal properties, and show why a variety of different sorts of "multiplication" are the same, etc. You can talk about faithful functors and explain how to organize the fact that naturals embed into integers embed into rationals, etc. Groups, monoids, etc. as John says. Universal algebra. Assuming a bit more background, one can do a simple  version of the category of vector spaces.</p>

<p>universal algebra makes sense for CS students for two reasons: algebras are data types and as long as you dont have name binding rewriting is equational reasoning in UA ... in particular, the rules of congruence and substitutions are pattern matching ... of course, one can explain rewriting without  UA, but if you also want to talk about the semantics (which makes sense in CS) you dont gain much by not talking about UA.</p>

<p>I know what you mean, Jules, but I'm not sure I totally buy it. There's no objective scale of "abstraction" (whatever that means) and even if there is, it certainly doesn't correlate to a scale of difficulty.  Most (not all) of us probably find category theory much easier than the supposedly more concrete theory of PDEs, for example.  I don't think we should accept that category theory needs to be any more difficult or mysterious than other branches of maths.</p>

<p>So, our approach is mainly focused at businesses and not at kids, but the idea is similar: We take people from any background and teach them CT. In our particular case, I've developed the following points that people might find useful:</p>

<p>Teaching a semester course in academia and teaching to "random people" are two very different beasts. And it's not a matter of prerequisites, it's the fact that people have a life and a job and most often than not they cannot be consistent in learning. Simply put, you cannot ask someone with a job to dedicate several days of their week to learn CT.</p>

<p>For this we developed a crash course approach. It's literally 4 days, roughly 9 hours a day, in which we do the equivalent of a whole semester. It is not easy at all (not for the students, not for me), but the idea of having a "category theory horror camp" someone keeps people motivated. It's like a sprint, you know you have to resist 4 days and things will be easier afterwards.</p>

<p>There are also some very important subtleties worth mentioning: I like to act like a "random guy that knows a bit of CT" when I teach. I really DO NOT like to inspire any sort of reverence in my students. Reverence is something that makes people afraid to ask questions, cos they don't want to look stupid.

<p>So, I think the real way to "diffuse" CT is to adopt an approach like this. Crash courses, enable people to consult a CT book without going mad if they need to. That's my 2cents. I can go more in detail if someone has more questions about "how's like to teach CT to random people" xD</p>

<p>Well as soon as they are deep enough into CT the motivation can be CT itself. So pretty soon you can drop the "real life examples", and actually work the other way around: You introduce new CT concepts and then show some applications</p>

<p>In any case, I think that the real difference when your group of students is small is that to teach well you have to do a lot of improvisation. In small groups the feedback you get is way clearer I think, there's less "noise", and this can be really a great thing if you are flexible enough to adapt</p>

<p>I don't know if the best approach is trying to make CT look useful in this context. It's more like, you can use Fruity Loops as an example of process, and abstracting from there ask "Doesn't this make the idea of 'process' interesting per sé?"</p>

<p>How do you get from studying objects to studying their automorphisms? I am sure it can be done, but is not easy to find a good story. Solving the rubik cube is a classic. But to actually develop this example in some credible detail takes a lot of work. Of course, if you are teaching maths undergrads you don't need a story, you can always just go on with the material ...  and leave the rubik cube as an exercise ...</p>

<p>Another REAL cool thing, I think, is too just point out how learning some CT literally increases your cognitive abilities. Best example of this: Say you teach Yoneda. Clearly no one understands anything. I mean they do maybe but then they are "but why?" Then you start doing stuff like the exponentials in presheaf categories, or other theorems where you heavily use Yoneda to get your definitions. At that point it clicks.

<p>That is the time when people realize that through CT they really broadened their cognitive abilities. They gained the ability to think relatively to other objects. When people realize this you really want them to stop and realize that they realized. :D</p>

<p>I like to think of CT as an axiomatic theory of structure preserving maps. (Of course, it is more than that, but also that.) A nice beginners example is the clock, which is a structure preserving morphism from the integers to Z/12. Structure preservation means that the clock is neither fast nor late. In your experience of teaching CT, when does this idea of CT as an axiomatic theory of structure show up?</p>

<p>Maybe CT can also be seen as a theory in which objects interact in a "nice" way. I think that in teaching CT to beginners the greatest challenge is to make them think categorically and appreciate the categorical way of thinking.</p>

<p>Hello all, I'm the other aforementioned high schooler. Sorry I'm a little late to the conversation, but I'm in Hong Kong, so I went to bed immediately after the seminar ended and I just saw all this activity on Zulip. <br>
First of all, I'd like to say that I'm truly humbled to have the opportunity to join this conversation, and it makes me really encouraged to see not only my fellow classmates around me but also older students and adults in this community talking about these issues of access and equity, especially for underprivileged students. <br>
Second, I think it's worthwhile to reiterate what <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="308790">@Merrick Hua</span>  said earlier; the two of us are definitely not representative of a typical high schooler, and the two of us have been incredibly privileged in terms of support, guidance, and access to opportunities to learn advanced mathematics. I myself am lucky enough to be attending an amazing high school with tons of resources and guidance for its students (I attend a private boarding school on the East coast), and if anything, the fact that I'm now invited to a conversation with academics in category theory is definitely another marker of that privilege. Recently, I've been thinking a lot about how I can use my own privilege to listen to and raise the voices of those who have had their voices silenced or diminished, and I'd be open to any insights or ideas about what I can do, if anything, to promote inclusion and diversity in the category theory community and the mathematics community as a whole. <br>
I suppose this naturally leads me to a question that I've been thinking about, which I hope might spur some discussion. Many of the anecdotes and examples of actions we can <em>do</em> to promote inclusivity and equity of access to opportunities to study mathematics have been from people who have the power to take actions that can lead to real change, be it through running a research group for minorities in ACT, or canceling class as a gesture of solidarity. But, what are ways that younger students such as myself could push for change? I've been reading a lot and trying to educate myself, but I'm curious to see if any of you in the mathematics community have any insights. <br>
This got a lot longer than I originally meant for an introduction (oops), but I hope that we can keep talking about this.</p>

<p>Eugenia Cheng has done a lot of general-public-accessible category theory, through her books (which include some of the examples that have been discussed above, developed from first principles), and through public lectures.<br>
I would like to draw attention to <a href="https://media.ed.ac.uk/media/Category+Theory+July+2019+Eugenia+Cheng+Public+Lecture/1_5hy0j4ne/51612401">her talk from last year</a>, which a bunch of the people here attended, due to it happening during the Category Theory 2019 conference.<br>
There are some valuable teaching lessons in there, since she discusses her teaching of category theory (and maths more generally) to arts students. There is also a <strong>great</strong> categorical explanation of relative privilege and intersectionality which feels very relevant right now. Finally, there is some original and relevant discussion of two contrasting attitudes/approaches to the practice of mathematics, teaching and research. I highly recommend.</p>

<p>And when I say "very basic group theory" I mean things like "what's a group" and then maybe "what does it mean for two groups to be isomorphic?"   The latter could be done like this: I've got a 4x4 addition table, but it's written in code.  Could it secretly be the same as addition mod 4?</p>

<p>In Oxford I did a few public lectures/interactive classes for primary school students in an outreach program run by Marcus du Sautoy: <a href="https://www.oxfordsparks.ox.ac.uk/content/marcus-marvellous-mathemagicians">https://www.oxfordsparks.ox.ac.uk/content/marcus-marvellous-mathemagicians</a></p>
<p>They had a bunch of great examples along these lines (ie. enlightening isomorphisms between elementary groups/posets/categories) that students (and I) really enjoyed. One example recalling John's tic-tac-toe comment above is as follows: consider the 2-player game in which players take turns naming a number between 1 and 9 (inclusive). No number can be named twice. The first player to name three numbers that add to 15 wins. </p>
<p>Students often found this game novel, and difficult to analyse. But an isomorphism can be constructed with tic-tac-toe, at which point many (perhaps from previous experience) found the game easy. I really enjoyed discovering this, and I think the students did too. It's a nice example of the power of a well-chosen isomorphism.</p>
<p>I'm not sure whether the teaching materials for the program are available anywhere (I no longer have copies) but they seem to have a YouTube channel, and I think more of these sorts of games can be found there.</p>

<p>I think we have a lot of work to do in finding ways to present CT at a lower level.  Lawvere and Schanuel's book was a really bold attempt at that (CT for high schoolers); some people like it, others don't. But we're slowly figuring out how to teach CT meaningfully without lots of undergrad courses as prerequisites.  E.g. fifteen years ago there weren't many decent intros to CT (for meathematicians) other than Mac Lane's, which is often seen as rather demanding in terms of  prerequisites. Now there are a whole bunch that assume much less of the reader. It's a gradual process, and everything has to be classroom-tested and tinkered with and tested again, but there's definite progress being made.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. I hope Seven Sketches has been a step in this direction. I think CT is definitely accessible to high schoolers, and I think a number have enjoyed Seven Sketches. Indeed, from our experience with Seven Sketches, it seems to me many without a university-level maths background can appreciate an introduction along the lines John suggests: an example-driven, play-filled introduction to groupoids, monoids, posets, and so on. I'm sure -- with a suitable amount of classroom-testing and refinement, as Tom already notes is critically important -- a really fun and accessible course could be developed along these lines.</p>

<p>That's a fantastic example of an isomorphism.

<p>It might not be as problematic as you'd think, if it's done in the context of logic / critical thinking. There is a growing school of thought in psychology that developed out of behaviorism called Relational Frame Theory. This school of thought lends support to the view that <em>basic</em> categorical thinking is quite natural, and can probably be learned early––not as a replacement for early math education but as logic training. According to this theory, humans learn language, critical thinking and many other skills by developing increasingly sophisticated relational associations among stimuli. The two relations that researchers have focused on so far are (1) opposites and equivalences and (2) orders (transitive antisymmetric relations such as taxonomies, implications, etc). For example, at a young age, a child might speciously hypothesize that a man is the opposite of a woman, but then develop a more sophisticated relational frame for gender as counter-examples accumulate. At a later age, a child can learn to parse increasingly byzantine arguments by developing the skill of wrangling the admissible and inadmissible transitivities among material implications. (read, compositionality in arguments)</p>
<p>Research results in the field are still settling, but Relational Frame Theory has found applications in Clinical Behavior Analysis (used for special education students with communication difficulties), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (a form of cognitive behavioral therapy) and in cognitive psychology more broadly. There are even psychologists who have developed Relational Skills Training methods that teach students to parse elaborate sets of predicates consisting of opposites / equivalences or orders using nonsense words to stand in for variables. These psychologists claim that the intervention can substantially increase a person's verbal IQ, which is considered to be the harder subset to train. However, the studies on this are usually sponsored by scientists with a stake in selling their techniques, so a grain of skepticism is appropriate.</p>
<p>In my view, much of basic Category Theory is––in part––the study of these and more sophisticated relational frames per se (in isolation). I am so confident of this that one of my medium term research projects is to develop more sophisticated relational skills training methods based on the gamut of basic categorical concepts ranging from idempotence to adjunctions. Maybe I'm wrong about this, but it seems like––at the very least––teaching kids to explicitly think about compositionality, commutativity and perhaps even functoriality, naturality, universality, etc. is both within reach and potentially highly beneficial. The catch is, you'd have to pitch it as "logic" training rather than as "math" because parents would ask "Where are the numbers? Where's the 'rhithmatic?" It could be posed as laying the foundations for computer science and programming skills.</p>

<p>Discrete maths can still come under maths, and that's what some aspects of category theory can look like to the outside observer. Also, there's nothing stopping numbers from appearing; indeed, I feel no shame in putting in a second recommendation for <a href="https://media.ed.ac.uk/media/Category+Theory+July+2019+Eugenia+Cheng+Public+Lecture/1_5hy0j4ne/51612401">Eugenia Cheng's talk</a>, which features the lattice of divisors of 30 as a lovely example of how category theory can lend geometric intuition to number theory.</p>

<p>Sure. If it works, it works!</p>

<p>Howdy folks, I just spoke with my best friend about what we are doing to promote early mathematical education by teaching CT. My friend is a senior analyst at the Dept of Ed who deals with vocational education. Rarely do our purposes align so that we can do a project together, but CT education seems to be an exception. <br>
NOTE: the armed services are very interested in vocational training and have large amounts of money  to devote. If we are to do something collectively we should be comfortable with our partners. FYI - I was in the Air Force and worked as a consultant for a number of governmental departments, particularly the State Dept.</p>
