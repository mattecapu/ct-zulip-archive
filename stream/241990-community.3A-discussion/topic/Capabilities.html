<p>If we want to figure out our values, it is essential to think about our <em>capabilities</em>.  What are we capable of as a community?  What is ACT capable of?  What is math capable of?  There is an underlying sense in many of us that ACT has revolutionary capabilities; what is the best precisification of this sense that you have seen, or can think of?  Once we know our capabilities, we can articulate our values in terms of how we want to use such capabilities.</p>

<p>Taking a generous view on the scope encompassed by CT, as <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="277067">Tom Leinster</span>  <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2010/03/a_perspective_on_higher_catego.html">does</a>, the most powerful thing that CT can do is lead us to unifying perspectives. Most disagreements arise from people holding incompatible views or priorities and having no means of adequately communicating those ideals in a common framework. This applies to international politics, different teams in a company or shared project, or at the level of individuals. That second option is where CT solutions are already starting to emerge, but I see no reason that it couldn't happen at other levels too.</p>

<p>I was going to write something very much along the lines of <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277473">@[Mod] Morgan Rogers</span> .<br>
I found at a certain point that the real difficult problems seemed to be communities that were trying to work towards the same goal not understanding anything the other communities they needed were doing. Sometimes these are related to people working in dual categories, and the unifying perspective of CT is one that allows dualities to exist without reducing them or failing to distinguish each side. (see <a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/bob.coecke/Yoshi.pdf">Maruyama's thesis on duality</a>. Finding such translations can be very helpful. <br>
I also find it very helpful to get an idea of where I should look for answers for something.</p>

<p>I started reading the Leinster piece that <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277473">@[Mod] Morgan Rogers</span>  linked to, I really like his "second definition" of category theory, as contrasted with the first, "obvious" one:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>It’s highly conceptual, with almost no calculation. (Contrast other proofs.) You could easily explain it out loud to someone while walking in the park. The only point when you might be tempted to reach for pen and paper is the last step, calculating the constant of proportionality, but even that makes only a small demand on your powers of mental algebra.</li>
<li>It solves the problem by moving to a higher level of generality — and getting the right level of generality, at that.</li>
<li>The generalization wasn’t quite the most obvious one. Good generalization almost always begins by carefully preparing the ground. Here, this was the little observation that for events that occur at most once, expected value is the same as probability. A more obvious generalization would be to ask what the probability of crossing was for needles of arbitrary length.</li>
<li>We see uniform behaviour across a class of objects (curved needles of arbitrary length). Under other circumstances this would be called functoriality or naturality.</li>
<li>There is a piece of grit around which the pearl forms. You can never solve a specific problem by entirely general means: at some point, you have to make the link between the generalities and the specific situation that you started with. Here, the grit is the calculation of the constant 2/π2/\pi, got by thinking about a circular needle. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I also have the impression that category theory isn't really about categories per se, it's rather a way of doing math, an aesthetic sensibility.</p>

<p>If two groups can find out that the views are dual, then in a way it would explain the difference and explain that any proof one group had in their category would, flipped around, be a proof in the opposite category. So at the very least it settles the discussions about which is best: they are a weird form of mirror image. Duality also does not identify both sides. Algebras and coalgebras have very different properties for example.  </p>
<p>There is a whole philosophy of duality in this sense. See Maruyama's <a href="https://repository.kulib.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2433/237072/1/2050-08.pdf">The Dynamics of Duality</a>.</p>

<p>Eugenia Cheng gives a really nice example of how this helps in her public lectures. I would recommend everyone watch the whole thing, but the relevant part is <a href="https://youtu.be/YHZKX0H6cUE?t=1406">here</a>, a section that lasts maybe 15 minutes.<br>
Having a common framework not only allows you to identify what you have directly in common with another party, it allows you to identify the common reasoning (as <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="281126">@Henry Story</span> has nicely described) and analogies between situations, and these form an essential basis on which to build constructive discussions. They also highlight fundamental power or information imbalances that must be addressed in order for a fair discussion and conclusion to be reached.</p>
