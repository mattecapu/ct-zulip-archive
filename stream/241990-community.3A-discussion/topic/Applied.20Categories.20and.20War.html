<p>Category theory is often applied to programming methodologies that are quite generally applicable, so they will be applied to warfare as well as other things.</p>

<p>If the military wants to improve their methods using category theory it doesn't mean that it will cause more suffering. Today they are able to act in a much "cleaner" way due to technology and thinking. And it means in particular less collateral damage if they want eg. to eliminate some leader of a terrorist organization. I think there is no ethical problem with asking these questions. I don't see how asking questions could be unethical.</p>

<p>A while back, there was a discussion about the ethics of accepting funding from military sources. Although, not strictly brought into that discussion, are there military applications of category theory? If so what might they be? Are those methods strictly to increase lethal engagement, or could they also be used in so-called "hybrid warfare"? Could someone using the methods of applied category theory cause untold amounts of suffering? And is it possible that research in the area could inadvertently cause the suffering of others? Could there be a categorical arms race between nations? Is even asking these questions moral and/or ethical? Have we opened Pandora's box? </p>
<p>It feels to me like the questions I'm asking are a lot like those asked of "the bomb". But I also could be overthinking things...</p>

<p>I mean, yeah, but that's kind of a cheap shot. I was thinking more about data integration and control, such as the focus of DARPA's CASCADE program. Though, I'm sure there are many more potential applications outside my knowledge and imagination.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sorry, I was going to say more but I got distracted.  I was going to continue and say that if category theorists help the military with specific projects like CASCADE they will be helping develop specifically <em>military</em> applications of category theory.  This is why I quit working on CASCADE: they began the program using an example of organizing search and rescue missions in a yacht race in the Caribbean, but then it changed to more clearly military applications.  </p>
<p>If category theorists work with the military it will also tend to help keep their military ahead of competing militaries, and civilians, in the development of generally applicable tools.</p>
<p>There's a lot more to say but I'm still busy!</p>

<p>Anyway, to these questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Could someone using the methods of applied category theory cause untold amounts of suffering? And is it possible that research in the area could inadvertently cause the suffering of others? Could there be a categorical arms race between nations? Is even asking these questions moral and/or ethical? Have we opened Pandora's box? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Pandora's box has been opened, and it's called "science, technology and mathematics".    It can <br>
cause untold amounts of suffering - or good.  Research in these areas can inadvertently cause immense suffering.   There is an arms race between nations in all areas of science, technology and mathematics.</p>
<p>Category theory is part of this, and I don't think it can be cleanly separated out.   That is, if everyone doing category theory quit now, the effects would be rather subtle.    As people never tire of telling category theorists, almost anything you can do with category theory can also be done without it.  The difference is mainly that with category theory it's gets done in a clearer, more generalizable and less error-prone way.</p>

<p>The military will eventually - and often quite promptly - use any sort of applied math that anyone comes up with.   So you can decide this is fine, or that it's unavoidable, and keep working on applied category theory... or avoid working on applied category theory, or avoid working on <em>explicitly military</em> applications of category theory, or for that matter <em>embrace</em> explicitly military applications of category theory: all these are self-consistent positions that people take.</p>
<p>Here's my personal position: I want to pursue applications of category theory to human health, climate change, etc., because  I can actually make a difference there, and perhaps a good difference.  These fields may otherwise be a bit slow in adopting categorical methods.</p>

<p>About five years ago I was thinking of this sort of stuff in terms of three mathematical keys that I discussed publicly at the time: CT (for compositionality), topology (and some global geometry, for global properties), and statistical physics (for emergent properties). Imagine a bunch of gizmos that the military wants to coordinate. You might want to model each as a sensor, actuator, and interface. That's a 2-simplex. You might glue interfaces and maybe constrain actuators. Now you're making a simplicial set. There might be some function over local groups of gizmos. Now you have a local section in a sheaf. You might want to engineer a behavior under an ensemble of environmental conditions. Now you're doing statistical physics. Finally you might want to assemble subsystems or groups into systems or teams, or you might want to fuse data or compose various protocols. Now you're doing CT.</p>

<p>I'll quote from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04869v1">https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04869v1</a>: "operadic formulations or realizations of data structures for multirobot systems such as the one sketched here are especially desirable because they hold the promise of engineering distinct functionalities in a coherent way. For example, detailed missions can be encoded using flowgraphs [19], constraints can be encoded using weighted maximum satisfiability and/or linear temporal logic formulas, teams can be encoded using simplicial sets [17], etc., and each of these data structures has an associated notion of operad."</p>

<p><em>On the phone, Musk said that he was looking at his laptop and could see “the entire war unfolding” through a map of Starlink activity. “This was, like, three minutes before he said, ‘Well, I had this great conversation with Putin,’ ” the senior defense official told me. “And we were, like, ‘Oh, dear, this is not good.’ ” Musk told Kahl that the vivid illustration of how technology he had designed for peaceful ends was being used to wage war gave him pause.</em></p>
<p>I would guess that quite a few of Starlink's developers were distressed by the prospects of <em>not</em> using it to wage war. Certainly I would have been distressed in such a position.</p>

<p><em>Musk’s sympathies appeared to be manifesting on the battlefield. One day, Ukrainian forces advancing into contested areas in the south found themselves suddenly unable to communicate. “We were very close to the front line,” Mykola, the signal-corps soldier, told me. “We crossed this border and the Starlink stopped working.” The consequences were immediate. “Communications became dead, units were isolated. When you’re on offense, especially for commanders, you need a constant stream of information from battalions. Commanders had to drive to the battlefield to be in radio range, risking themselves,” Mykola said. “It was chaos.” Ukrainian expats who had raised funds for the Starlink units began receiving frantic calls. The tech executive recalls a Ukrainian military official telling him, “We need Elon now.” “How now?” he replied. “Like fucking now,” the official said. “People are dying.” Another Ukrainian involved told me that he was “awoken by a dozen calls saying they’d lost connectivity and had to retreat.” The Financial Times reported that outages affected units in Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Kharkiv, Donetsk, and Luhansk. American and Ukrainian officials told me they believed that SpaceX had cut the connectivity via geofencing, cordoning off areas of access.</em></p>

<p>FWIW your first link contains the passage <em>Reason, by itself, can lay out a road map to peace or to war, to tolerance or to persecution, depending on what the reasoner wants.</em> While some might argue for nonviolence no matter what, I have a hard time imagining Jesus Christ himself doing that instead of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleansing_of_the_Temple">flipping over tables and whipping folks</a> when circumstances warranted.</p>

<p>My intent is not to reinvigorate a debate, just to say that historically a VAST number of technologies funded by governments (not just USA and not just DOD funding elements) have been what is often called "dual use". This isn't unique to applications of category theory or math by any means. The discussed CASCADE program is a good example, since the dual use is search and rescue (SAR) but also <em>combat</em> search and rescue (CSAR). Dual use is often merely a change in application context and so very little if anything can be done in practice to avoid contributing to the crossover by those who might be concerned. </p>
<p>Yes, I would say mosaic is the quintessential <em>compositional</em> force package design concept... so very relevant. For better or worse, there are a ton of possible applications of CT to military theory, doctrine, and practice. For instance, I think some of the constructions in categorical systems theory and cybernetics could be extended to model a more general theory of interacting adversarial systems. Another dual use arises: military (obviously) and competing firms within a marketplace. Not to mention applications to model a more general competition between national power structures (ideas like DIMEFIL) in which a military plays only a marginal (though most visible) role.</p>

<p>If they want to eliminate a precise leader who appears to live in the same building than you, you prefer that they send special forces to captur him rather than destroying the whole building and kill lot of people. It's the way Ben Laden was captured as long as I understand. That's the kind of operations that the US or european countries know how to do, using lot of work on getting information and highly-trained soldiers with high-tech equipment. Compare this to Russia sending their soldiers to certain death by using low-tech "human wave attacks" in Ukrainia. I would prefer being an afghan guy, the US operating in my country, rather than an Ukrainian guy, Russia operating in my country. If they don't even care about the life of their people, they will care  even less about my life.</p>

<p>I recently realized that Zulip allows for muting of threads, which means off-topic (wrt actual category theory math) discussions aren't forced on the larger group. This makes it much easier for me to consider engaging here and there in the fringe threads. That is neither here nor there, just felt like stating it.</p>
<p>I will see if I can briefly offer a satisfactory response through the lens of nuclear deterrence terminology. There is a notion of countervalue and counterforce operations in nuclear deployment. There is no reason the terms can't extend to conventional munition deployment. </p>
<p>In counterforce, strikes are limited to military targets. In countervalue, civilian populace and infrastructure are targeted. One goal of counterforce is to intentionally limit civilian impacts (as strange as it may sound given the nuclear context!). The US broadly applies this counterforce idea... with many, <em>many</em> mistakes no doubt, but generally tries. It's part of the legal framework of US armed conflict: LOAC. [Edit: I should say clearly this has not always been the case in the US, especially with respect to nuclear weapons. Also, I mention US in particular only because that's where I am]</p>
<p>If I imagine myself to be a civilian in a nation under military action by a force practicing counterforce methods, I would want their targeting methods and munitions to be as precise as possible, limiting collateral effects and thus minimizing risk to me, who may not care one bit about the grand geo-political machinations surrounding the conflict. I think this is getting at what the OP was saying. </p>
<p>On the other hand, if I am a civilian in a country subject to attack from a countervalue-oriented nation, I would very much like for their military to have highly ineffective weapons so they are less likely to work on me. </p>
<p>Of course nothing is so simple, and everyone knows these ideas, so often military targets are intentionally placed within civilian areas (even by the "good guys"), like a "human shield" ploy, leading to difficulty in executing a purely counterforce operation. But one can still imagine the "ideal" scenario, as silly as it may seem to consider idealism in war. I would just say that nations vie for interests, and it's hard to avoid conflict in all cases, so one should hope that those responsible for carrying it out study and understand it as formally as possible.</p>

<p>Sorry, I didn't answer the question. If I'm attacked by an imperial military force... Hmm... Again I prefer that they kill or capture all the military of my country and not me. Or better, that they destroy all the military equipment of the army of my country, without killing anybody, or something like this, precise and effective, which I'm sure will not kill me, my family and my friends.</p>

<p>Sorry, it was still not the question. Making weapons more effective is just a small part of how you can use category theory for instance in the army. I don't think that this is the main thing that interest military today. We already know how to make guns and bombs that do what they are conceived for.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The imagination of US people is indeed limited.<br>
Revoking some security clearance and expulsion from the project to a well-known university are enough to make the entire academic community mad?<br>
With the security clearance there is even an inspection committee, and Oppenheimer even has an attorney?<br>
The attorney argued these procedures are not legal, not a fair fight, like being beaten up, with injustice?<br>
And the committee even has a two-to-one passage; one of them even wrote a petition of dissent?<br>
Really, don't even talk about McCarthyism to us; your McCarthyism in our country is just child game.</p>

<p>Living in what's considered a democratic state, I certainly feel my agency is pretty thin when it comes to military decisionmaking both in peacetime (assets to build) and in wartime (both when to have it happen and the doctrines to conduct it under).  This is not <em>unique</em> to the military, but rather common to many "special interests".  However, it's especially bad because of both the heavy consequences of those decisions and the heavy level of investment of those "special interests".</p>

<p>I also feel like while defensive wars like the current war (mostly) in the Ukraine are sometimes necessary, arms races between major powers only make these wars harder and make the defense of small states more dependent on major powers.

I haven't confirmed they didn't invent a <em>category</em> of combat drones but they probably didn't and they didn't develop the drones.

<p>Ukraine got to its 1991 position as part of the Soviet Union, not as an independent power.  And actively rolling back existing capability, <em>especially</em> nuclear, is not something I support in most circumstances.  The military work I mostly oppose is the <em>most creative</em> work, inventing whole new categories of weapons, new combat doctrines, fundamental new capabilities in sensors and communication, etc.  You need not fear for the <em>existence</em> of your military-industrial complex as long as there are authoritarian states to oppose.</p>

<p>As to whether the world would be safer if the US refrained from these activities: I'm pretty sure thermonuclear weapons (the H-bomb) weren't invented truly independently by anyone other than the US; the US invented them in peacetime and they were stolen by the Soviets.  The existence of combat drones makes the world less safe by making both asymmetric warfare and fundamental democratic control over the military less effective and any period of time they could have been delayed by would have been welcome.  Fully unmanned weapons platforms currently under development take this even farther.</p>

<p>I actually agree with everything you just said except the idea that it's somehow wise to stifle creativity. Because other folks won't. That is the true arms race. As mathematicians we are all part of it. We can dodge it for a time, like Leray in his POW camp developing sheaves instead of PDE methods, but the day may come when those sheaves are eventually used for something. And it will probably end up touching warfighting. Necessity is the mother of invention and nothing says necessity like someone threatening you or those you protect.</p>

<p>Drones and unmanned weapons platforms have been and are a particularly dangerous game, allowing the substitution of industrial capacity for the capacity to replace trained soldiers, forcing a state or area that's being invaded to have to carry out a reverse invasion to deplete the aggressor's capacity to make war.  This is really not good for most states and people that are just trying to mind their own business until threatened and makes things just unilaterally better for aggressors, <em>especially</em> genocidal ones.</p>

<p>I think the thing you've been doing with Tom Leinster's work is particularly the sort of thing people in the US shouldn't be doing.  The fact that the Chinese are investing much more heavily in technological espionage than we are is the best evidence that we are doing something wrong here.  We are accelerating military technology ahead of having any good pro-democracy political technologies to deploy in concert with it.  We're not going to make China disappear as a military power, and nor is China going to invade us anytime soon.  They may well invade Taiwan, believing we won't have the stomach to help defend a country we can't even bring ourselves to officially acknowledge, using the technologies they've stolen from us, and hoping to go on to steal the technologies like chip fabs we've exported to Taiwan on top of getting back their oh-so-precious territorial integrity.</p>

<p>I'm not trying to claim everything you've ever done wrt military applications is bad; I think it can even be acceptable sometimes to accept military funding for mathematical work if it's fundamental enough and particularly if you would otherwise accept other funding and do the exact same thing.  But I think it's legitimate to not let military funding draw you into doing work with a direct military application or a dual-use component that you might not otherwise do; <em>especially</em> if you don't understand the scope of the military applications involved; you might even want to let it steer you away.  And if even more people did this, we would have a safer world.  Nobody's saying you can prevent all military use of the work you do, much less the fundamental principles behind it; you can make it incrementally harder and more expensive though, and this is just as legitimate and respectable as engaging in protests.  Maybe it's more so, as methods of elite control in democracies have evolved substantially in the past decades to neutralize the power of protests, but we haven't (yet) developed a means of getting work done without any workers.</p>

<p>I think of something like that as more of a decision support technology that is dual use.  But I think if AI as uninterpretable as LLMs is doing more of the heavy lifting in making decisions than humans then humans are screwed no matter which ones are nominally in charge.</p>

<p>But definitely models like this are useful to help in evaluating a decisionmaking mechanism on desiderata like "will people feel the decision is legitimate even if it goes against their private preference" and "does it reliably make use of people's private knowledge or does it degenerate to being controllable by coalitions".  Part of having a good decisionmaking mechanism is it has to exert some influence over people's preferences but not too <em>much</em>.  But it has to be <em>some</em> both to reduce long-term conflict/polarization and to protect participants against outside influence from more hostile social processes that <em>do</em> affect their preferences.</p>

<p>I disagree that they are "basically solved" (and the weaknesses of opinion diffusion on social networks as a decision mechanism, while they include outside controllability, are hardly limited to that!)  Also if the non-controllability of the social network needs outside enforcement from a compliant sovereign regime it doesn't truly exist.  In order to "win" democratic decision making has to be effective at winning internal competitions against the alternatives, not just external ones where it's supported by a sovereign.  For one thing no sovereign in existence would choose to support it, including democratic ones.</p>

<p>One of the fundamental technical challenges of an effective democratic decision mechanism is asymmetric information; often special interests have significantly more information about the subjects of their shared interest than the average member of the general population.  How can we make use of that information, giving the people (whether within the self-interested group or outside) who gather that information fair compensation for doing so, without giving the special interests too much and letting them walk all over everyone else?  Direct democracy as usually implemented tends to lose hold of the information, while representative democracy (through lobbying) overrewards it substantially.  Markets have their own interesting failure mode ("lemon markets") for this kind of asymmetric information problem.  Why aren't you using sheaves to work on this?</p>

<p>Honestly not sure. Counterfactuals are hard (eg, how long until it gets invented anyway? does Cold War turn hot? what happens with Japan, not least if the Soviets claim a zone?) and nuclear power is a net plus on its own merits.</p>
<p>This is the only case of tech development that I can think of that gives me pause. </p>
<p>Dunk on me for not saying “no” outright if you like. But I think the idea that nukes never get developed without the Manhattan Project is far fetched at best and I choose not to interpret your question in what I think is an absurd way.</p>

<p>It's an interesting question whether "the majority of research in the US" is funded by the DoD.   </p>
<p>Total US medical and health research and development investment was $245.1 billion in 2020 - I picked that area because it's big.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the DoD 2024 budget request includes $145 billion for research, development, test, and evaluation (RDT&amp;E).</p>
<p>But that's what I was able to look up in one minute, and both those figures leave out a lot.   In  2023, the  DoD had a total budget of $2.04 trillion, which is pretty amazing.  Global investment in the low-carbon energy transition was only $1.1 trillion in 2022!</p>

<p>Ahh okay, no idea what it could be. I would never have expected that to be the public motivation of a DoD-funded project though; given my understanding of those kinds of projects as an aeroastro major, there's typically some official PR motive with a universally presumed unspoken motive to apply whatever's worked on to whatever other applications the work could be useful for (the main "other applications" of relevance to ethics being espionage and weaponry), along with presumed obfuscation of those other applications to engineers and theoreticians working on the project that don't hold higher-ranking positions in the military. So with that context in mind,  rescuing people in the Caribbean for potential yacht race disasters as the public motive is... Well, pretty humorous to me honestly</p>

<p>Of course I got the idea that anything one did for DARPA would wind up helping the defense department.

<p>I agree, and would go even further to say incredibly respectable and admirable along with understandable. I've heard far too many people that I look up to advocating for nullifying those moral quandaries by dually considering the potential benefit to humanity, which is just incredibly unsatisfying to me because I feel like the realized benefit from military research is moreso happenstance or coincidence (like the internet from DARPA), while trying to apply every piece of research conducted on a DoD budget to espionage or warfare is very intentional by the institution and its leaders</p>

<p>Somewhat off-topic – I did notice there were some very well-designed elements behind the jarring colour scheme and such, but those jarring bits are not the only "ugly" parts my eye was drawn to – e.g. the complete lack of a gutter between the video element and the text to its right seems downright sloppy.</p>

<p>More on-topic – I am not on board with the idea of zero military spending.  I expect the relationship between military spending and security to be a nonlinear one.  While a strong argument can be made that Western governments operate in a region where military spending and security are negatively correlated, I expect they are positively correlated when military spending is near zero.  In other words, the pendulum can be swung too far in both directions.</p>

<p>I don't think they're considering all EPSRC-funded projects as "defense". If you go to the tab marked Research Partnerships, there's a list of four projects, all involving EPSRC, the values of which sum to the £11million-ish associated with EPSRC in the Overview. The University of Edinburgh obviously has many many more than four projects supported by EPSRC (amounting to a lot more than £11million). Those four grants are presumably the ones the University identified as defense-related in response to the freedom of information requests listed under the FOI tab.</p>
<p>The headline figure of £240million in "defense industry partnerships" is arguably a bit misleading if you have research grants in mind. The great majority of this seems to be coming from "financial partnerships", which I presume means investments, all of which are indirectly held. The research partnerships amount to that £11million figure. Mind you, the list of research partnerships looks to me surprisingly short...</p>

<p>My only question is: Do these people know that the world - at least here in Europe - has changed A LOT in the last couple of years? There's a saying in my language: When the sea is calm every idiot can be a sailor. I was strongly anti-military until recently. Then the war came, with Russia invading Ukraine and winning. And I'm honestly shit-scared and strongly in favor of increasing the defense expenditure. All in all: Easy to be anti-military expenses when your borders aren't in danger.</p>
<p>I don't think this has anything to do with ACT - which is anyway not really relevant enough for defense at the moment - but yes, boosting collabs between universities and the defense sector, at the moment, is something that is needed in europe, unfortunately.</p>

<p>You're conflating two points here. Being in favour of expanding defensive capabilities need not involve universities in any way. The position of this campaign, which I agree with, is that it <em>should not</em>. Military research does not need to be integrated into educational institutions.</p>

<p>I suppose this wouldn't significantly reduce the amount of research funded by the military, at least not in the long run: it would just move it out of the universities.

<p>The one thing that makes me raise my eyebrows is the concept of work that "doesn't have military applications".   I suppose there is some math that doesn't, but a lot of work on elliptic curves or proof assistants or homotopy type theory or applied category theory, including my own work on structured and decorated cospans for system modeling, definitely has military applications - if not yet, soon enough that the US military is willing to fund it.</p>

<p>I have at least heard the argument that if the military is funding your research which has no obvious military applications, then what they are buying is your network of people, in particular undergrads or early graduates who are the typical target of recruiting; so "moving it away from universities" would, at least, have the effect of making this harder or impossible.<br>

<p>I think something like that is true: I've seen it at work, especially since I did research for DARPA for a while.  </p>
<p>If most universities were disconnected from the military - which seems almost impossible here in the US, but it's still interesting to imagine - then the military would probably expand its own university system.   There are already <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_military_schools_and_academies">military colleges in the US</a> - for example in the Washington DC area I believe the largest mathematics department is run by the military.   But I can imagine these increasing their attempts to hire top-notch scientists and mathematicians.</p>

<p>I was strongly anti-military until recently. Then the war came, with Russia invading Ukraine and winning. And I'm honestly shit-scared and strongly in favor of increasing the defense expenditure.</p>
<p>[...]yes, boosting collabs between universities and the defense sector, at the moment, is something that is needed in europe, unfortunately.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You're conflating two points here. Being in favour of expanding defensive capabilities need not involve universities in any way. The position of this campaign, which I agree with, is that it <em>should not</em>. Military research does not need to be integrated into educational institutions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Military technology advances. For instance, Russia now has ballistic missiles that are so fast that's impossible to take them down. So heavy investment in military research is needed even just for boosting defensive capabilities. If that weren't the case, we could sleep very comfortably knowing that we still have some arquebuses left in our arsenals.</p>
<p>Having cleared this point, I do not understand how we're supposed to expand our defensive capabilities if no one does the needed research to improve the technology we need to do so. Involving universities seems just natural to me.</p>

<p>Well, research is not only done in universities, right?  Here are "evil", "good" and "neutral" examples: the atomic bomb, some Covid vaccines like Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna, ChatGPT.  None of these were developed in a university.  They all used research previously done in some university, and perhaps involved people whose main employer was or had been a university, but the crucial, last stages of research needed for realizing the specific technology at stake had nothing to do with a university (at least as far as I know).  So, I interpret Morgan's statement as: if you want to prove some general theorem about partial differential equations, you'll do it in a university; if you want to figure out how that theorem applies to building hypersonic ballistic missiles, you should do it somewhere else (typically, in a private company subcontracted by the military somewhere).  Maybe it's idealistic, simplistic or whatever, but I don't think it's unreasonable.</p>

<p>That being said, I honestly don't know how military funding works.  Does the military actually asks an academic partner to contribute to the development of some very specific military technology, like a weapon?  Were the Russian's hypersonic missiles developed in partnership with a Russian university?  I would think that the true goal of the military is never explicitly revealed and that the final stages are developed entirely in an extra-academic context.  So academics can always say "I was just proving theorems, I know I was being funded by the military but I had no idea that it was going to end up being used in missiles!".  Which makes things less clear-cut in this discussion.</p>

<p>I'm not sure "where the money comes from" and "how the funders intend the money to be used" and "whether the developer is a university or not" have, in reality, much to say about 'morality/ethics' or even 'predicting how people will actually use things'.  Not only might such intentions change over time, as John's story shows, but so many applications are accidental.  ARPA funded the internet thinking about withstanding nuclear attack, only for that to take over commerce.  Sony built game consoles, only to find their $30 controllers being used as replacements for $30,000 steering wheels in attack submarines.  From the point of view of these proposals, I can't even figure out if these historical episodes would be considered something to avoid or not.</p>

<p>The NSA has claimed to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the US, though it seems hard to find out how many work there.

Leinster's argument in the article John shared is sensible, but even that was only tangentially related to the discussion we were having up to this point.</p>

<p>Incidentally, AI safety is going down much of the same path: developing ways to combat/constrain an hostile agent instead of fostering the things that keep human nice to each other, eg mutual interest, sociality, empathy and affection.</p>

<p>I agree, it's a bit sad. For me, AI safety should be more concerned about the "information ecosystem". I believe it is the Achilles' tendon of our modern societies.</p>
<p>Actually, I was lucky enough to co-author a <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/hash/f4b9ec30ad9f68f89b29639786cb62ef-Abstract.html">paper</a> in which we studied how failures could hinder the learning process (sgd-based). Here, "failure" can also mean polluted dataset.</p>
<p>Since then, my colleagues went further and are now very concerned about the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15259">security issues</a> posed by large ai models. (quick note: it is not at all about agi ...)</p>
<p>Regarding the relation with war, I'd say that the information eco-system is clearly a battlefield; just think about the massive disinformation campaign, or billionaire's buying social networks, etc. </p>
<p>I am more worried by the "information-tech" hazards than say traditional weaponry. I also feel like ACT will find applications faster in the info-tech.</p>

<p>Bit more complicated than that. My understanding is that Nash was motivated by econ (as were some earlier people in the pre-history of the field like Cournot), but the focus of game theory research in the 50s was at RAND, whereas it didn't start being a really big thing in econ until the 80s</p>

<p>I do not understand how we're supposed to expand our defensive capabilities if no one does the needed research to improve the technology we need to do so. Involving universities seems just natural to me.</p>

<p>Well, research is not only done in universities, right?  Here are "evil", "good" and "neutral" examples: the atomic bomb, some Covid vaccines like Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna, ChatGPT.  None of these were developed in a university.  They all used research previously done in some university, and perhaps involved people whose main employer was or had been a university, but the crucial, last stages of research needed for realizing the specific technology at stake had nothing to do with a university (at least as far as I know).  So, I interpret Morgan's statement as: if you want to prove some general theorem about partial differential equations, you'll do it in a university; if you want to figure out how that theorem applies to building hypersonic ballistic missiles, you should do it somewhere else (typically, in a private company subcontracted by the military somewhere).  Maybe it's idealistic, simplistic or whatever, but I don't think it's unreasonable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't know about the other two, but this is factually false for the Manhattan project, which was developed in strict synergy with many universities by selected personnel, most notably Fermi  and some selected collaborators at UChicago, which was in constant contact with Oppenheimer.</p>

<p>Is the question here "what should governments do about the fact that other governments and non-state actors pose military threats?"   I thought we were talking about what applied category theorists should do.  They're both interesting questions, but they are somewhat different questions.    </p>
<p>I don't think applied category theorists should or even can bear the main burden of figuring out the correct role of the military in geopolitics.   I guess if some mathematician is trying to "shut down the military" or something like that, they are taking on this burden voluntarily.   Then they need to become as knowledgeable about this subject as they are about math.    But I can imagine more modest mathematicians who just want to figure out what <em>they, themselves</em> should do.  And some slightly less modest mathematicians who just want to figure out the appropriate relation between the university system and the military.</p>

<p>I think I'm in the modest camp: I mainly think about what <em>I, myself</em> will do in relation to the military, as part of the general problem of what I should be doing.    After fumbling around a bit, I decided to avoid working for the military, avoid working for big tech companies, and avoid working on AI - among other things.   In general I try to avoid making big and powerful institutions bigger and more powerful.  But more importantly I decided to take on some positive commitments: to work on global warming, to work on ecology, and to work on epidemiology.   This keeps me plenty busy.</p>

<p>Why exactly do the medium-modesty folks want defense research separated from universities? It’s hard to see what that change really affects, concretely—seems like an arbitrary reorganization of the overall research ecosystem. If you’ve got a general attachment to the ideal of the university as dedicated to truth and not to fighting, well, it seems like what you want is simply a different kind of thing than a university. I didn’t see any really concrete explanation of this in the thread other than avoiding defense projects at university makes it harder for the defense people to recruit your students, which sure seems to suggest that students aren’t adult humans with the right to work for whoever they choose and the ability to decide the ethics of this for themselves.</p>

<p>This argument about "students having the right to choose" sounds to me the same as the argument of those who suggest that "freedom of speech" is the same as "everyone has a right to a platform and a loudspeaker". Of course every individual has the right to work for whoever they choose; likewise, as mathematicians&amp;academics, we have the right to organise and change the context in which this decision is made, and make it so that the perks of certain career choices are balanced by downsides about what collaborations are available with our institutions. Which is the sort of action that Tom Leinster was advocating for re: NSA and GCHQ.</p>

<p>This seems a very much one-way discourse, where 'unis and defense are and should stay separated' is the norm. Again, I think this posture is a result of  the effects of Pax Americana, at least in some places of the world. I also used to think that way since the idea of a 'peaceful Europe' has always been given for granted for me.</p>
<p>As usual, this is  the norm (until?) now, but has never  been always this way. During WWII the question was often reversed to 'how can we, as university faculty and students, participate to the defense effort?', and indeed _many_ famous academics of the mid century where involved in defense efforts (Bletchley Park anyone?).</p>
<p>Going further back, it is worth noting that many engineering departments were originally instituted as stemming out from the 'military genius' (the part of the army devoted to constructing bridges etc. or to coordinate sabotage and strategic demolition). So the relationship between engineering and the military was very strong.</p>
<p>Personally, for me now question has shifted completely. I went from "why should my work be used to propel military effort, which I find deeply unethical" to "how  can my work help preventing a Russian nuclear warhead falling on my head in the next n years?" All in all, I want to reiterate once more that, at least for us Europeans, the world has changed completely since 2022, in a way that we have never known since 1945. I feel that the whole posture of this discussion is simply inadequate for the times ahead.</p>

<p>hey. so i didn't resist and checked what is being discussed here yesterday. and i want to say something as an old man to a group of very smart people.</p>
<p>Smart people have a problem. They know that they are smart, so they draw their conclusions far, and confidently. And the world doesn't know that they are smart, so it goes its own way. Being smart is good for algebra, but it doesn't help you much with predicting things. So when you draw your conclusions far, you deviate from the world. You slide into an ideology of some sort of another. You become a puritan of some sort or another.</p>
<p>You cannot predict the consequences of your own actions. You cannot avoid contributing to potential murders. If you produce a lollypop, if you make it really good, you sell it very widely, and if people use too much lollypop it becomes bad for them. If they use WAY too much it's not just that it rots their teeth, but it makes them kill each other to burn all the energy that your tasty lollypops gave them.</p>
<p>The Google guys really honestly meant to do no evil. They even did evil even to themselves.</p>
<p>Lawvere lived in the times of a real actual war. In the times of demonstrations. He was very radical. He became not just a communist, but a maoist. Devoted maoist, because the unjust war that he was protesting against was against maoists. All in the name of being against the wretched war. And then it turned out that there was a cultural revolution. Maoists tortured and murdered people...</p>
<p>We shouldn't preach. It is always false. Everything becomes false when it is preached.</p>
<p>There are good people at NSA and there are bad people at NSA. There are good people on this list, and there are bad people. Are you really sure that you can tell the difference?</p>

<p>Sure. There were also many conscientious objectors. You can't pretend that everyone was on board with "the war effort" or that there wasn't intense social pressure to participate and sometimes even greater threats to one's life or career if one refused (cf. the red scare).

Mine aren't arguments against dismantling that connection as much as yours aren't arguments against maintaining it.

<p>No, I did not forget, but this is wildly different. We're talking about a full conventional (if not nuclear) war between two (three considering the  US, four considering what China may do) superpowers. War in Yugoslavia in the early nineties was absolutely terrible, but equating that to what _this_ war may become is foolish. We're talking a (very, unfortunately) probable WWIII. There's literally nothing that compares to that since 1945.</p>

<p>I'm sorry <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="679887">@Fabrizio Romano Genovese</span> , and I sincerely am not trolling you here: the only argument you gave for military research happening in universities boils down to convenience. I am not arguing against the existence of military research (although there is a more nuanced discussion to be had regarding the economic resources allocated to it relative to other social causes in certain countries). How exactly do you see military presence in universities as a matter of survival? To the contrary, I would like universities to be exclusively civilian so that there is  some international law protecting them from being justifiable military targets ((not that such laws have had much impact on decision-making by the Israeli government in recent times, mind you)).</p>

<p>The entire effort of war revolves around the concept of convenience, from Sun Tzu to Clausewitz. So yes, if 'convenience' means 'achieving something before your enemy does', that justifies it</p>

<p>It is a very hard question indeed, no doubt about it. I really think it depends on context. I do not think it is unethical to defend oneself if one feels threatened, and 'feeling threatened' is for sure a personal opinion. Personally, I've never felt as threatened as in the last year, so for me the answer is very clear cut.</p>

<p>I spend a lot less time thinking about whether it's ethical or not for me to do various things than figuring out what I should actually do.   It might be ethical for me to develop military tech.  But is this what I'm best at doing?  Is this what I really enjoy?  Or is the situation so desperate that I should do it even if I'm not good at it and don't enjoy it?   I think these other questions are decisive, and their answers will vary from person to person.  If I lived in Ukraine the last one would have a different answer.</p>

<p>Speaking as someone living in a Baltic state, I relate to what seems to be the mainstream position here, which is "yes, we need to ramp up defense efforts" but coupled with intense distrust of decision-makers. I feel this dimension is missing in what you are saying, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="679887">@Fabrizio Romano Genovese</span> . Even if I agreed wholeheartedly that we need to make all possible efforts to defend ourselves from Putin, what you have in reality is a US Congress much more willing to spend money to help commit war crimes in Palestine, than to help Ukrainians. Why should one collaborate if they distrust the use people at the top will make of their collaboration?</p>

<p>Let's see... the US spent $822 billion on the military in 2022, which was 3.5% of its GDP, while the UK spent $62 billion, which was 2.2% of its GDP.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_with_highest_military_expenditures">Other countries are listed here</a>.  Interestingly the UK now spends the 5th most of any country in the world on the military.</p>
<p>I'm having a bit of trouble getting data on military spending <em>within</em> academia, but I bumped into <a href="https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/nicholas-turse-the-military-industrial-academic-co">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1958, the Department of Defense spent an already impressive $91 million in support of"academic research." By 1964, the sum had reached $258 million and by 1970, in the midst of the Vietnam War, $266 million. By 2003, however, any of these numbers, or even their $615 million total, was dwarfed by the Pentagon's prime contract awards to just two schools, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Johns Hopkins University which, together, raked in a combined total of $842,437,294.</p>

<p>And this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Association of American Universities further notes that the Department of Defense accounts for 60% of federal funding for university-based electrical engineering research, 55% for the computer sciences, 41% for metallurgy/materials engineering, and 33% for oceanography. With the DoD's budget for research and development skyrocketing, so to speak, to $66 billion for 2004 -- an increase of $7.6 billion over 2003 -- it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that the Pentagon can often dictate the sorts of research that get undertaken and the sorts that don't.</p>

<p>And this, which is pretty intense:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, [in 2002], thanks to a quick reinterpretation of federal law, the Pentagon found itself able to threaten Harvard with a loss of all its federal university funding, some $300 billion, if its law school denied access to military recruiters. Unable to fathom life ripped from the federal teat, Harvard caved, ushering in a new era of dwindling academic autonomy and growing military control of the university.</p>

<p>I think people fail to see how big Russia is. Also, the fact that they can conscript people very easily is a big advantage they have. Russia's strengths in war have always been numbers and weather, since time immemorial</p>

<p>I think what has taken everyone by surprise is the idea of a conventional war between nuclear superpowers. This flips completely the cold war posture that war between superpowers can only be a proxy war, because a direct conflict would immediately escalate to nuclear war. At least in the West, almost no one saw this coming.</p>

<p>And so now we are in this ugly situation where military expenses have to be ramped up because we never took into account that we may have needed to defend ourselves against a 'traditional' invasion. Literally what a shit time to be alive, I'd like very much not to find myself in a trench 5-10yrs from now if I have to be honest.</p>

<p>Here's some text from the former US Director of the National Reconnaissance Office and Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for space:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The long story short is we have algorithms that are very sensitive for denoting changes in imagery. If I take a field and the forest area around it, a deploying Soviet force would put its radars right at the edge of the field, and the missile launchers, and further into the forest would be the command control and it would be camouflaged. They’d be running cables and you would see a grouping of command and control buildings, or grouping of fire control apparatus, and the launcher. We’re looking through hundreds of thousands of acres for the mobile missiles that were extant in the Cold War. We were able to find these things, and we built algorithms to help imagery analysts find these things in the proverbial shell game. </p>
<p>We took these algorithms and turned them onto a large number of mammograms that had been given to us by Dr. Daniel Kopans at Harvard. The head radiologist at Harvard Medical provided numerous mammograms where the pathology was known and we did a blind test with algorithms. We noticed that, with not much change, the algorithms that we used to help analysts identify dispersed missiles were very useful in denoting calcifications of breast tissue ducts that tend to calcify as a precursor for understanding where cancer may result. In these interactions, I recall an interaction with Daniel Kopans, who called and said, This is really quite revolutionary. </p>
<p>This was undertaken as a public policy in order to aid radiologists—It increasingly occurred to me that, surprisingly, the slowest adopters of technology are doctors. They’re trained, they’re really smart, they just turn out to be—They don’t go to Best Buy and buy the most radical technology. They’re just not inclined. Dr. Kopans said, If we get this technology adopted, we would reduce breast cancer deaths by— It was something like over 40 percent. It was big.</p>
