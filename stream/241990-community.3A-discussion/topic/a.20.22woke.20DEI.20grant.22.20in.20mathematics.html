<p>The US Senate has a <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2025/2/cruz-led-investigation-uncovers-2-billion-in-woke-dei-grants-at-nsf-releases-full-database">new press release</a> saying, among other things:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Cruz-Led Investigation Uncovers $2 Billion in Woke DEI Grants at NSF, Releases Full Database</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>U.S. Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ted Cruz (R-Texas) released a database identifying over 3,400 grants, totaling more than $2.05 billion in federal funding awarded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) during the Biden-Harris administration. This funding was diverted toward questionable projects that promoted Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) or advanced neo-Marxist class warfare propaganda.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of these grants is Emily Riehl's project "Homotopical macrocosms for higher category theory".    </p>
<p>You can see a complete list of all 3,400 grants on a spreadsheet <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/index.cfm?a=files.serve&amp;File_id=94060590-F32F-4944-8810-300E6766B1D6">here</a>.     The grants are classified as mentioning one or more of 4 things: social justice, race, gender, and environmental justice.  Riehl's grant is flagged as mentioning social justice.   She probably got in trouble for the following passage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>IN PARALLEL, THE PI HAS CONCRETE PLANS TO CONTINUE HER EXPOSITORY AND OUTREACH WORK WHICH INCLUDE A NEW BOOK (ELEMENTS OF INFINITY-CATEGORY THEORY, JOINT WITH VERITY), LECTURES DIRECTED AT THE GENERAL PUBLIC, SURVEY ARTICLES PREPARED FOR A VARIETY OF AUDIENCES, AND EFFORTS TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO ADVANCED MATHEMATICS, SUCH AS HER SERVICE ON THE EQUITY, DIVERSITY, AND INCLUSION ADVISORY BOARD AT THE BANFF INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH STATION.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Below I have quoted the entire grant description on that spreadsheet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HOMOTOPICAL MACROCOSMS FOR HIGHER CATEGORY THEORY - HIGHER CATEGORY THEORY IS INCREASINGLY BEING USED AS THE METATHEORY FOR NEW RESULTS IN SEVERAL AREAS OF MATHEMATICS, CREATING A HUGE BARRIER TO ENTRY FOR MATHEMATICIANS WHOSE PRIMARY TECHNICAL EXPERTISE LIES IN ANOTHER FIELD. PAST JOINT WORK OF THE PI REIMAGINED THE FOUNDATIONS OF INFINITE-DIMENSIONAL CATEGORY THEORY WITH THE AIM OF SIMPLIFYING PROOFS BY REPLACING ANALYTIC METHODS, THAT RELY ON THE COMBINATORICS OF A PARTICULAR MODEL OF INFINITE-DIMENSIONAL CATEGORIES, WITH SYNTHETIC ONES THAT APPLY IN ANY MODEL. ONE PART OF THIS PROJECT SEEKS TO DEVELOP A COMPUTER-VERIFIABLE FORMAL LANGUAGE THAT EXPRESSES ONLY STATEMENTS ABOUT INFINITE-DIMENSIONAL CATEGORIES THAT ARE INVARIANT UNDER CHANGE OF MODEL. SUCH A LANGUAGE WOULD FORCE USERS TO SPEAK NO EVIL BY GUARANTEEING THAT EVERY STATEMENT THEY EXPRESS IS MODEL-INDEPENDENT. THIS PROJECT CONNECTS TO THE PLANS TO RECAST THE THEORY OF INFINITE-DIMENSIONAL CATEGORIES IN A NEW PROPOSED UNIVALENT FOUNDATION SYSTEM FOR MATHEMATICS, IN WHICH HOMOTOPICAL UNIQUENESS UP TO A CONTRACTIBLE SPACE OF CHOICES BECOMES GENUINE UNIQUENESS, PERMITTING STREAMLINED DEFINITIONS OF FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS. BOTH OF THESE PROJECTS WILL BE UNDERTAKEN IN PART WITH MENTEES OF THE PI AT JOHNS HOPKINS. IN PARALLEL, THE PI HAS CONCRETE PLANS TO CONTINUE HER EXPOSITORY AND OUTREACH WORK WHICH INCLUDE A NEW BOOK (ELEMENTS OF INFINITY-CATEGORY THEORY, JOINT WITH VERITY), LECTURES DIRECTED AT THE GENERAL PUBLIC, SURVEY ARTICLES PREPARED FOR A VARIETY OF AUDIENCES, AND EFFORTS TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO ADVANCED MATHEMATICS, SUCH AS HER SERVICE ON THE EQUITY, DIVERSITY, AND INCLUSION ADVISORY BOARD AT THE BANFF INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH STATION. THE PIONEERS OF HOMOTOPY TYPE THEORY - THE NEW PROPOSED UNIVALENT FOUNDATION SYSTEM - ENVISIONED A COMPUTER-VERIFIABLE FOUNDATION FOR INFINITE-DIMENSIONAL CATEGORY THEORY, BUT SOME COMPUTATIONAL CONTENT IS LOST THROUGH THE CLASSICAL REASONING USED IN CLASSICAL HOMOTOPY THEORY. WITH COLLABORATORS, THE PI WILL DEVELOP A NEW MODEL FOR CLASSICAL HOMOTOPY THEORY IN A PARTICULAR CATEGORY OF CUBICAL SETS, IN WHICH CUBICAL FIBRATIONS ARE REQUIRED TO BE EQUIVARIANT, RESPECTING THE SYMMETRIES OF CUBES DEFINED BY PERMUTING THEIR DIMENSIONS. A LONGER-TERM AIM IS TO USE SIMILAR METHODS TO OBTAIN CUBICAL SET BASED PRESENTATIONS OF ALL INFINITY-TOPOI. A COMPUTER PROOF ASSISTANT BASED ON EQUIVARIANT CUBICAL FIBRATIONS WOULD HAVE THE CORRECT CLASSICAL SEMANTICS BUT WOULD BE ABLE TO RESTORE THE COMPUTATIONAL CONTENT TO UNIVALENT MATHEMATICS. A FINAL PROJECT EXPLORES HOMOTOPICAL MACROCOSMS FOR HIGHER CATEGORY THEORY, AIMING TO PROVE THAT THE COLLECTION OF CARTESIAN FIBRATIONS BETWEEN (INFINITY,N)-CATEGORIES ASSEMBLE INTO A CARTESIAN FIBRATION OF (INFINITY,N+1)-CATEGORIES, WHICH CAN BE REGARDED AS SOME SORT OF CATEGORIFIED HYPERDOCTRINE FOR (INFINITY,N)-CATEGORY THEORY. RESULTS OF THIS NATURE WOULD ESTABLISH A GLOBAL LIFTING PROPERTY AGAINST HOMOTOPY COHERENT DIAGRAMS THAT SHOULD AID FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS IN (INFINITY,N)-CATEGORY THEORY. THIS AWARD REFLECTS NSF'S STATUTORY MISSION AND HAS BEEN DEEMED WORTHY OF SUPPORT THROUGH EVALUATION USING THE FOUNDATION'S INTELLECTUAL MERIT AND BROADER IMPACTS REVIEW CRITERIA.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R48243">https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R48243</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Federal grants are awarded under legally binding agreements, such as grant agreements or cooperative agreements. These agreements include terms and conditions that are required to be met by the grantee in order for the grantee to be in compliance with federal statutory and regulatory provisions. When the grantee is found to be in noncompliance with the terms and conditions of a federal grant award, the grantee may be required to return the funds to the federal government. The process by which a federal agency seeks repayment of expended funds for noncompliance is known as recoupment where the federal government is seeking to recoup funds previously paid to the grantee. Recoupment processes are sometimes called grant funding clawbacks since the federal government is taking back previously awarded funding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is happening: the USG is taking granted money back out of accounts.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This case may go to a higher court now - I don't think anyone knows.   But there's no law of physics compelling the executive branch to pay the money it has promised it would pay, and at this point it's only the laws of physics that I trust to be enforced in the USA.</p>

<p>We'd do well to heed warnings from other countries that arbitrary and extensive budget cuts may in fact foreshadow the dismantling of the NSF as an institution. </p>
<p>Take the example of my home country: <br>
The University Grants Commission (UGC) of India played the same role as the NSF (at least until as recently as 10 years ago). The UGC's budget in 2013--14 was about 100bn rupees. In 2016--17 (two years after the present political regime began), it was down to about 25bn rupees. In 2025, its budget is around 33bn rupees. Given that 100 rupees in 2015 are worth around 160 rupees in 2025, this is a ~80% reduction from 10 years ago.</p>

<p>I'm not best-placed to answer this, not having lived or worked in India for over 10 years. </p>
<p>That being said, from what I hear, the situation is pretty grim---I've heard of people having to subscribe to questionable political agendas in order to receive, or to continue to receive, funding for research. Also from what I hear, Hindutva is more into glorifying the "alternative reality" of ancient Indian science --- the work of a surgeon or astronomer from 2000 years ago is more important than one from 20 years ago. </p>
<p>All of this is anecdotal.</p>
<p>It should be noted that some of the budget previously allocated to the UGC has been diverted to a couple of newly set up institutions whose purported goal is to replace the UGC (<em>why</em> it needed replacing is unclear --- the reasons stated range from "inefficiency" to "promoting radical leftism"). This has led to a lot of reshuffling of people with the power to decide what kind of research gets funded (perhaps the actual reason for the creation of these institutions?).</p>

<p>It seems very easy to imagine this administration similarly trying to strangle the NSF as a tool of our analogue of the Indian Congress (but under the banner of ending the promotion of neo-Marxism etc) and partly replace it with an "anti-woke" science agency, which would naturally also turn out far more political than the NSF.</p>

<p>I've been looking at <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/math/comments/1ioo2x9/database_of_woke_dei_grants/">this list</a> of other math grants that supposedly have appeared on Ted Cruz's list of "woke DEI grants".   I've checked to see if they're actually on the spreadsheet, and I can't find the one on "elliptic and hyperbolic differential equations", but I can find some others.  </p>
<p>Here's one based in La Jolla, California which is somewhat connected to category theory, but mainly homotopy theory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>COMPUTATIONS IN CLASSICAL AND MOTIVIC STABLE HOMOTOPY THEORY -ALGEBRAIC TOPOLOGY IS A FIELD OF MATHEMATICS THAT INVOLVES USING ALGEBRA AND CATEGORY THEORY TO STUDY PROPERTIES OF GEOMETRIC OBJECTS THAT DO NOT CHANGE WHEN THOSE OBJECTS ARE DEFORMED. A CENTRAL CHALLENGE IS TO CLASSIFY ALL MAPS FROM SPHERES TO OTHER SPHERES, WHERE TWO MAPS ARE CONSIDERED EQUIVALENT IF ONE CAN BE DEFORMED TO THE OTHER. THE EQUIVALENCE CLASSES OF THESE MAPS ARE CALLED THE HOMOTOPY GROUPS OF SPHERES, AND COLLECTIVELY THEY FORM ONE OF THE DEEPEST AND MOST CENTRAL OBJECTS IN THE FIELD. HISTORICALLY, MUCH IMPORTANT THEORY HAS ARISEN OUT OF ATTEMPTS TO COMPUTE MORE HOMOTOPY GROUPS OF SPHERES AND UNDERSTAND PATTERNS WITHIN THEM. THIS PROJECT INVOLVES FURTHERING KNOWLEDGE OF THE HOMOTOPY GROUPS OF SPHERES, USING OLD AND NEW TECHNIQUES AS WELL AS COMPUTER CALCULATIONS. THE PROJECT ALSO INVOLVES STUDYING AN ANALOGUE OF THESE GROUPS IN ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY; THIS FALLS UNDER A RELATIVELY NEW AND ACTIVELY DEVELOPED AREA CALLED MOTIVIC HOMOTOPY THEORY, WHICH APPLIES TECHNIQUES IN ALGEBRAIC TOPOLOGY TO STUDY ALGEBRAIC GEOMETRY. THE BROADER IMPACTS OF THIS PROJECT CENTER AROUND SUPPORTING THE LOCAL MATHEMATICS COMMUNITY THROUGH MENTORING AND PROMOTING DIVERSITY. THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR WILL HELP BUILD THE NASCENT HOMOTOPY THEORY COMMUNITY AT THE UNIVERSITY AND PROMOTE WOMEN AND MINORITIES IN THE SUBJECT THROUGH SEMINAR ORGANIZATION AND MENTORING. ONE OF THE MAIN PLANNED PROJECTS IS A LARGE-SCALE EFFORT TO COMPUTE THE HOMOTOPY GROUPS OF SPHERES AT THE PRIME 3 IN A RANGE, USING OLD AND NEW TECHNIQUES SUCH AS THE ADAMS-NOVIKOV SPECTRAL SEQUENCE AS WELL AS INFINITE DESCENT MACHINERY. THIS WORK WILL BE AIDED BY COMPUTER CALCULATIONS, WHICH SHORT-CIRCUITS SOME OF THE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED IN PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS. ANOTHER MAIN GROUP OF PROJECTS CONCERNS COMPUTING THE ANALOGUE OF THE STABLE HOMOTOPY GROUPS OF SPHERES IN THE WORLD OF R-MOTIVIC HOMOTOPY THEORY. THIS REPRESENTS A CONTINUATION OF PRIOR WORK OF THE PI AND COLLABORATOR; THE PLAN IS TO SUPPLEMENT THE TECHNIQUES USED IN THAT WORK WITH COMPUTER CALCULATIONS AND A NEW TOOL, THE SLICE SPECTRAL SEQUENCE. A THIRD PROJECT CONCERNS THEORY AND SPECTRAL SEQUENCE COMPUTATIONS AIMED AT COMPUTING THE COHOMOLOGY OF PROFINITE GROUPS SUCH AS SPECIAL LINEAR GROUPS AND MORAVA STABILIZER GROUPS. THIS AWARD REFLECTS NSF'S STATUTORY MISSION AND HAS BEEN DEEMED WORTHY OF SUPPORT THROUGH EVALUATION USING THE FOUNDATION'S INTELLECTUAL MERIT AND BROADER IMPACTS REVIEW CRITERIA.</p>

<p>Perhaps mercifully, the PI's names are not listed in the spreadsheet.  If they were, I can imagine Trumpies harrassing these people online.    Any idea who this is?</p>

<p>It's very difficult to figure out exactly where all the lines are. The first thing to consider is that the US has some unique features, obvious, but worth listing: </p>
<ul>
<li>The country is massive, both in land mass and population. Millions of people can be in the streets of Southern California with Elon barely noticing.</li>
<li>The US spends more than any other country on military by about a Jillion dollars. Anybody looking fondly at South Korea has a very different hurdle to jump.</li>
<li>Some already are physically resisting, it just cannot take the form one immediately imagines for the reasons above. It does seem like there has been a strong selection bias for those in power to be those who are also eager to follow along, even against court orders to halt certain executive orders. So resistance is more local, less grandiose, and in total less effective.</li>

<p>I agree with Joe.    So far the most important resistance is coming from judges staying or overturning the Trump administration's actions.   That's how people got their NSF grants back, for example.</p>
<p>However, there were coordinated protests in all 50 states on February 6th, and there's a Wikipedia article detailing them:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50501">50501</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The same organization is organizing <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/50501-protests-update-anti-trump-march-50-states-expands-2025741">protests in all 50 states on President's Day, February 17th</a>.   I wouldn't be surprised if these keep getting bigger.  I think in March there's a planned "don't show up to work" day, but I'm not finding what I read about that.</p>

<p>I find it hard to believe that the research itself is "woke" in any way. It is likely that it got flagged for that one passage.</p>
<p>But it is possible that there is something  even more sinister going on and the executive has investigated the sexual orientation, political opinions, etc. of grant holders in order to try to purge them from academia.  This happened to communists and socialists in Canada and the United States not so long ago. Certainly, I wouldn't put it past them if they had the ability.</p>

<p>What I'd like to see is a list of the grants in maths that <em>didn't</em> end up in this database. I saw people saying things like including a sentence or two about running a workshop to which underrepresented people will be particularly invited is something that everyone had to include. But if this were true, <em>every single grant</em> would have ended up in this database. This cannot be true, right? I suspect we would have heard if every mathematics grant, nay, nearly every grant across all of academia (save, say, parts of it that are fairly resistant to having "DEI boilerplate", as I imagine economics might be), was suddenly cancelled by the move.</p>

<p>I've seen some other vaguely DEI-relevant statements from other grants, and a number of them really are almost analogous to "we will run a workshop in a poor district that hasn't got to see this stuff before, to encourage students to study maths". Except instead of school students, it's grad students or ECRs, and instead of "poor district" it's a different group with fewer chances in the past.</p>

<li>
<p>The Cruz press release says the list covers nearly 10% of grants approved in the past four years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's true that having a "Broader Impacts" section is required by the NSF.  This works almost the same way as the National Interest Test in our ARC grant proposals: it explains how the project will provide environmental, social, or cultural benefits beyond directly advancing knowledge in the field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expanding science participation among underrepresented groups counts as a broader impact. Despite what the extreme right claims, this does not mean projects without a direct focus on these groups lose funding. It just is (should I say, used to be? ) one specific way in which a project can have broader impact. E.g. if your research outputs will help save birds from oil spills, that's definitely broader impact, even though it has nothing to do with underrepresented groups. I think the people you read might have confused "including a broader impact statement was mandatory" with "including a sentence or two about underrepresented people was mandatory" (or chose to conflate them for some reason).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It looks like they selected all grants whose broader impact included specific actions benefiting certain underrepresented groups (not veterans, not disabled people, but ethnic minorities, women, etc.). This would not lead to all grants being proscribed, but may plausibly affect 10% of them. It's less likely (not that I would put it above them) that they cherrypicked specific PIs that they personally wanted to inconvenience. I think at this point they're happy to inconvenience anyone who they perceive as a potential opponent.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Please don't give Ted Cruz's staff more credit than they deserve.  They did a naive text search on grant proposals, and didn't check the results:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/only-about-40-of-the-cruz-woke-science">Only about 40% of the Cruz "woke science" database is woke science</a>, <em>Astral Codex Ten</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I saw many scientists <a href="https://x.com/HermanPontzer/status/1890059071140815282">complain</a> that the projects from their universities that made Cruz’s list were unrelated to wokeness. This seemed like a surprising failure mode, so I decided to investigate. The Commerce Department provided a link to their database, so I downloaded it, chose a random 100 grants, read the abstracts, and rated them either woke, not woke, or borderline.</p>
<p>Of the hundred:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>40% were woke</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>20% were borderline</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>40% weren’t woke</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is obviously in some sense a subjective determination, but most cases weren’t close - I think any good-faith examination would turn up similar numbers.</p>
<p>Why would a list of woke grants have so many non-woke grants in it? After reading the hundred abstracts, I found a clear answer: people inserted a meaningless sentence saying “this could help women and minorities” into unrelated grants, probably in the hopes of getting points with some automated filter.</p>
<p>For example, from Grant 1731:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>New Security Exploit in Energy Harvesting Systems and Its Countermeasures:</em> An Energy Harvesting System (EHS) has emerged as an alternative to battery-operated Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Instead of using a battery, EHS self-powers its device by collecting ambient energy from external sources such as radio frequency, WiFi, etc. However, since such ambient energy sources are unreliable, their resulting power is inherently unstable and often goes out. To address the problem, EHS leverages a capacitor as an energy buffer and computes when the capacitor secures a sufficient amount of energy, i.e., capacitors are at the heart of any EHS devices. Unfortunately, capacitors can be unreliable in the presence of frequent power failure across which they continuously charge and discharge, losing their original capacitance over time. More importantly, attackers can exploit the capacitor reliability issue to cause incorrect outputs or degrade the quality of service in targeted EHS devices. To this end, this research project focuses on investigating attack surfaces and designing cost-effective countermeasures. The project outcome will lay the foundation for batteryless Internet of Things services by maintaining their quality of service and security. The project also aims to integrate research findings into undergraduate teaching and promote equitable outcomes for women in computer science through K-12 outreach program.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did you catch the last sentence?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The project also aims to integrate research findings into undergraduate teaching and promote equitable outcomes for women in computer science through K-12 outreach program.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some version of this sentence was in most of the nonwoke grants that made it into Cruz’s database. They promised to investigate some totally normal scientific topic, and then at the end they said somehow it would cause equity for women and minorities. I assume somebody told them that if they didn’t include this sentence, the Biden NSF would ding them for not having enough equity impact.</p>
<p>Typical examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We will do outreach, and probably some of it will inspire underrepresented minorities to go into STEM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will employ undergraduates or PhD students, and probably some of them will be underrepresented minorities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People will benefit from our work, and probably some of the beneficiaries will be underrepresented minorities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This was probably 90% of the false positives. But there were other categories, including grants that accidentally used scientific terms that had alternative woke meanings. For example, Grant 1424:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Cis-Regulatory Basis of Developmental Plasticity and Growth in the Development and Evolution of Beetle Horns, a Class of Highly Diversified Weapons</em> - This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY22, integrative research investigating the rules of life governing interactions between genomes, environment and phenotypes. The fellowship supports research and training of the fellow that will contribute to the area of Rules of Life in innovative ways. How organisms develop is regulated through the interactions of genes and environmental conditions like nutrition. Gene regulation (turning genes "on" or "off") therefore is an important point of control for many aspects of development, such as growth. Further, when gene regulation is modified by evolution, it can lead to the emergence of new traits. Yet, exactly how gene regulation is controlled is not fully understood. The fellow will research horned beetles, which are well known for their diverse forms of environment-dependent development, in order to understand how environment affects gene regulation to promote diversity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This one gets off to a rocky start by mentioning the word “cis” (a cis-regulatory pathway is when genes regulate the expression of other genes on the same DNA molecule). Then it ends with the words “promote diversity” - in context referring to how genes promote a diversity of beetle phenotypes, but probably this looks bad in a simple CTRL+F search.</p>

<p>This.  My question is: Do you think this was right in the first place? To me, it seems that the general idea of 'having to align with/subscribe to some political program/agenda/topic to get money' is shortsighted, and basically wrong. It has no political effect really, as a lot of people will squeeze whatever fashionable opinion in to get extra points, without caring an inch about it. It also has no positive long-term incentive as in doing so, one has to factor in that the political climate may shift and said stuff will inevitably backfire.</p>
<p>I think it would be much better for academics, institutions, universities and the entire research ecosystem if math grants would be about maths, and maths only. This said I<strong> clearly don't agree with Trump's policies even a little bit</strong> (I can't believe I have to write it explicitly), but at least I hope people will be mindful about the consequences of squeezing politics into anything the next time they have to submit some application.</p>

<p>To me (a non-American, very much non-concerned with America's internal state of affairs) the worst outcome of 'squeezing politics into everything and bringing the country to the brink of a civil war' is that now Americans have managed to elect a guy which is carrying out the <strong>worst</strong> foreign policy since pretty much forever (yes, way worse than Kissinger, incredibly!), and America's historical allies (as we Europeans are) will suffer the biggest consequences of this.</p>

<p>Allow me temporarily to play some kind of devil's advocate. In Australia, we don't have an NSF, we have the Australian Research Council, which is something like the complement of the NIH - it covers all non-clinical basic/fundamental research. So you have maths and physics and chemistry and engineering and history and philosophy and .... all funded by the same body. One of the things that is necessary to do is add some statement about the benefit to Australia more broadly rather than just one's own field. It used to be worse (imposed by the centre-right government of the time) in that it was a non-negligible part of the process, even if relatively small.</p>
<p>This part of the grant has to be reflected in the one-paragraph public summary, which is the analogue of the stuff we are seeing above from the NSF grants.</p>
<p>So you get inanities like "This will have benefits within mathematics and also <strong>in physics/chemistry in the long run.</strong>" in a grant about tensor categories (this is a small one, because the people applying are big shots are half of them outside Australia) or "Expected outcomes include flexible techniques for constructing twisted algebras for use further along the research pipeline, and cross-pollination of ideas within mathematics. <strong>Benefits include enhanced international collaboration and increased Australian capacity in pure mathematics, particularly algebra and operator algebras</strong>." on a grant linking categories and operator algebras. You cannot get away from including this, it's not a matter of some kind of vague social expectation. Here's one on a mathematics of string theory grant: "Significant benefits include bringing leading international researchers to Australia, cutting-edge research outcomes and research training in high-profile international collaborations."</p>
<p>This is to my mind one of the silliest parts of the application, because nearly everyone in pure maths has to put in some bland slop, because there almost always <em>simply isn't anything that fits the bill</em>. These 'benefit statements' are so small because the whole piece looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Character sheaves and Langlands duality. In the recent years a large part of mathematics has been driven by the Langlands program. The aim of work proposed is to contribute to this program from our unique point of view. The expected outcomes include a comprehensive understanding of character sheaves and how they apply to longstanding difficult problems in mathematics. In addition to addressing fundamental questions in mathematics and expanding our understanding, the research program connects Australia to the most exciting recent mathematical developments thus benefiting Australian researchers and students. The project will also train highly qualified individuals who can make significant impact on science, industry, technology, and economy through their specialised skills.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These paragraphs are what the Government Minister in charge of the ARC in principle could look at before giving the final approval to the awarding of the grants. Thankfully this is not the process any more, but it used to be the Minister could veto grants based on the short paragraph as I quoted. And people in the humanities whose research was niche sometimes did (!)</p>

<p>However, it is probably the case that having <em>something</em> like this keeps people on their toes and makes them think about, at least for a moment, potential benefits to Australia, and see if they can say anything at all that the taxpayer footing the bill would feel is some epsilon of justification.</p>

<p>To return to the main topic here, I repeat my statement that I'd like to see some grant descriptions, if there are any, along the lines of the above that in their broader impacts statement say nothing about side-benefits that might be aligned with DEI purposes. I suspect there are some, which if so would give the lie to the claim that everyone has to include DEI stuff. If they did, there'd be no NSF grants left under the current process. So if it isn't <em>required</em>, one might ask <em>why</em> people include a statement like "my side-channel advocacy for underrepresented groups..."</p>
<p>If it isn't <em>required</em> by the NSF in some vague way, then it is at most something like a social pressure, or perhaps people gaming the system in the same way that people puff up their college admissions ("I spent a summer digging wells in Africa for poor villages while teaching the kids to read")</p>

<p>I listen to Sean Carroll's podcast episode on the affair, and he outlined at least part of the assessment process. As in Australia, academics play a huge role, if not at minimum the vast majority, in assessing grants. If the "wider benefits" statement is written for them, then one is only persuading one's colleagues, not shadowy government employees filtering grants for sufficiently "woke" text</p>

<p>Well, there are some options: people really do keenly support and believe the stuff they write (this would be true for some proportion, and it may well be a rather large proportion); people are not opposed to the general idea of addressing things like the extreme gender imbalance in the field, and so will go along with any suggestions or encouragements or social norms that lead to inclusivity-related comments (this would be another reasonable chunk of people, I guess); people don't care either way, but are willing to play the game for the purposes of boosting their chances (again, we are pushing towards most people, once the previous groups are taken into account); and then people who don't like it, but will grit their teeth and do it; people who don't like it (or maybe just don't care) and won't do it.</p>

<p>Being at such a distance, and never having applied for an NSF grant (but I have twice applied for an ARC grant here in Australia, and been in conversations around applying for funding for a conference), I also have no idea about the process. Maybe the assessment criteria that expert assessors are given says they must look for social impacts like DEI-related stuff and give a mark on these. I don't know. But I'm not going to assume I know how widespread such statements are.</p>

<p>OK, so if I haven't made a mistake, and working with a round figure in the middle of 2-3%, does this mean something like 8% of grants were flagged as having key words that triggered the anti-DEI warning bells? That's not too far off from the smaller figure I mentioned:</p>

<p>Obviously extrapolating from all-NSF to just maths is going to not be exact, but as a prior estimate, this means in the ballpark of only 10% of successful NSF maths grants invoked some kind of DEI. I presume that the people who wrote these take such initiatives seriously, and only a <em>tinier fraction again</em> of them would be either feeling pressured to include such a statement against their general judgement, to either game the system or for fear of reprisal.</p>

<p>Right, I agree with your conclusion: if only a small fraction, say 10%, of successful NSF grant applications mention DEI and other phrases that make Cruz see red, this language is not required to get a grant.   And this suggests that people who <em>do</em> include this language actually mean it.</p>
<p>Retreating from generalizations to the initial case at hand, I'm pretty sure that Emily Riehl does indeed advocate diversity, equity and inclusion in mathematics.  I gather this both from her many public statements and the fact that in her grant proposal she mentions serving on the DEI board at Banff (the math research station in Canada).</p>

<p>It looks like a detail missing here is that NSF grants require a Broader Impacts statement, and <em>one</em> of the official ways in which you can satisfy this is by diversifying the STEM workforce.

<p>Ok, the problem of having a 'broader impact statement' is clearly a top-down one: Since in the end a good chunk of grant money is taxpayer money, higher up in the political foodchain people need a way to justify the expense. "My grant application is good for nothing aside for marginal improvement in a god forsaken field" makes it difficult to justify the budget expenditure over the years.</p>
<p>Still, a rational government would allocate money separating it in various classes: Something along the lines of "actual practical impact", "important theoretical advancements" and "god knows, probably useless but worth a gamble". The funny thing is that we developed very good techniques to estimate the risk that comes attached with each category, so budgeting according to these lines is definitely possible.</p>
<p>In this case, someone that wants to submit a grant that is _purely_ theoretical wouldn't have to put any bs about impact in their application (be it broader impact, DEI stuff, "trump-will-like-it" stuff, applications that will never really exist and whatnot) and just focus on the actual problem they want money to solve.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the thing academics complain about the most as of today is not just lack of funding but the incredible bureaucratic/administrative overload they need to cope with.

<p>Grothendieck's mathematics is more than 50 years old at this point and only now we're BARELY starting to see it applied to non-pure-maths fields like Engineering. In asking researchers questions like those, you're only giving them the incentive to lie. This sort of questions creates nothing but noise, and since noise must still be produced somehow, it translates to more work for grant writers in exchange of, well, nothing.</p>

<p>I agree it's annoying, and I would prefer to not have to put some relatively shallow statement about the broader impact, but in Australia mathematicians kind have it sorted, with a true statement that indicates the benefit that is essentially so generic and indirect it can feel silly writing it. Something like "will benefit the country by building capacity in research and boost Australia's international standing" is true, barely, and requires very little thought. The people on the ARC panel assessing grants after the external expert reviewers have gone over them know that this is the best we can do.</p>
<p>It's different to the US system where it seems to be "you must add in something that will be a real-world benefit", as Ralph says.</p>
<p>I certainly can't make claims about if the system is sensible or not, but big string of posts above was just digging into the evidence and what it implied from a mere numbers game.</p>

<p>Yes, but this sort of impact has nothing to do with the impact evaluation metrics researchers are asked to answer in a grant. Note: They not only ask "how will your research impact your field of research?", which is a perfectly legit question which includes also what you're pointing out. They also ask things like "how will your research impact society, the country, politics, the galaxy and the whole universe timeline", which to be honest seems a bit too much and/or far-fetched to be of any relevance.</p>

<p>I agree that there should be a separation of concerns. That's precisely my point. BTW the "academics must take care of everything" is a rather new thing (it has become the status quo in the last 3 decades), and all academics are complaining about this because it overloads them administratively. It seems a net loss to me, which derives precisely from the Reaganian posture that Unis should be treated like they were companies, not the other way around.</p>

<p>Sure. What I mean is that on one hand you have a bunch of taxpayer money that you need to allocate. On the other hand you have a bunch of projects that need resources to be carried over. If the funding requested is more than the money available (read: always), you have the typical allocation problem, namely: what do I fund?<br>
From the grant-giving perspective (the organism allocating funding), one could rank projects according to various parameters: One parameter could be impact (how good does the project do?). The other could be risk (what are the probabilities that the project actually delivers?). If you go back a few years (ex-post reasoning is obviously easier), on one hand of the spectrum you have, for instance, building a hospital (decent positive impact, all things considered low risk). On the other hand of the spectrum you have funding AI research (potentially huge impact, very high risk it goes nowhere).</p>
<p>In absolute layman terms, the higher the risk, the less percentage of the budget should go into it (or the highest the need to hedge the high-risk allocation with something else). What matters is that budget allocation according to risk is one of the most studied fields of practical economics, and we have all sort of techniques to allocate funding to maximize impact when risk is known. <br>
...The other most studied field of practical economics is probably 'risk assessment'. There are, especially, a lot of techniques to assess the risk of projects that have a potentially big, but really not-so-clear impact, like, for instance, the impact of some super novel category theory to some field of engineering in n decades.</p>
<p>All in all what I'm saying is that we have developed, over the last 5-6 decades or so, a lot of tools to be really good at allocating budgets for research, and to evaluate research for what it is, without the need of any far-fetched, hyperbolic claims. Deciding not to walk the rational path when it comes to this is a choice. A choice that many governments do, and that I personally find borderline criminal.</p>

<p>Thanks. The thing is, the words you say are profoundly divorced from my understanding of the matter. How in the world would you assess the risk of a category theory project, concretely? I have literally no idea how you could possibly even begin to do so in a way that would track at all with the truth, so it’s quite shocking to hear that apparently this is a solved problem. If it is, then how come all grants are instead allocated using profoundly insufficient heuristics of, essentially, legible prestige and signaling of seriousness?</p>

<p>To be clear, if you could calculate the risk, I am sure there are great economic algorithms for budgeting. It would just be an ontologically shattering event for me to be convinced that you can actually calculate that risk.</p>

<p>To draw an analogy, many government (and other) funding agencies now require that the results of the research they fund ends up open access in some form, because the intellectual results are a public good, and shouldn't be monopolised by publishers. This is just a condition on accepting the funding. The work of open access advocates to directly persuade academics to sort out their own open access was at best a very limited success, so the focus switched to promoting the idea to funding bodies, who have slowly come around to the idea. The funding bodies hold the levers over academic behaviour, and so this has been a more effective tack.</p>

<p>Asking academics to make at minimum an effort to not exclude a subgroup of the population (aka taxpayers) from academic society (for whatever reason: implicit bias, entrenched culture etc etc), or at least consider making a minimum effort, or at least consider promising to probably make a minimum effort (which is what a number of these grants have), as part of getting access to taxpayer money, feels like a very small price to pay. No one seems to be putting a declaration to promise to be "woke" in front of people that must be signed to even enter the lottery that is grant application season, but perhaps its invisible to me, an outsider in another country.</p>

<p>Were this latter to be happening then I agree this is a rather disagreeable state of affairs. We in Australia have (nearly) had the reverse problem, with the centre-right (verging on neoliberal, I guess) government pushing for all publicly-funded research to be essentially focused towards immediate societal (read: economic) impact and industry engagement. Also, the success rates of funding a rather low. Sean Carroll mentioned a 50% success rate for the NSF funding panel he was on. For the ARC it's more like 16%, and even though there's no "pay for my summer salary, plz" effect here, universities (at least, research universities I am familiar with) compel people to apply for grants regularly as part of their KPIs; essentially, if you don't have one, you need to apply for one every year until you do. And these are hundred-page applications, and a real nightmare.</p>
<p>So imagine what it's like in pure maths where the government is pushing to try to only fund things that have immediate impact, but the universities push everyone to apply every year, and the successful grants are usually only those with a full professor on them, and maybe at best half a dozen get funded a year?</p>

<p>Bayesian inversion too seems like magic to the uninitiated... In any case some efforts would be really low hanging fruits. Even feeding all the grants applications to an LLM together with outcomes and results and finding out which grants end up winning and which of those winning end up producing cited/impactful results would be really insightful or at least insightful. The overall lack of experimentation and willingness of improving things is the real depressing factor in all this.</p>

<p>Sorry, I didn't understand that you wanted 'evidence' of the fact that - for instance - insurance companies work and don't usually go bankrupt. I can scavenge some papers if that's what you want.<br>
I also never mentioned h-indexes explicitly, I don't hink they are a good metric. I merely said that there are probably _a lot_ of unexplored correlations between applications and outcomes which could be analyzed and studied, if only whoever decides on budget allocation had the will to do so. I am also convinced that the lack of will to do so may depend on the fact that when decision procedures are murky, decision makers have a better edge at inserting their own biases (and interests) into the process. I don't see this as a particularly efficient outcome, and rejecting tout court the posture that the actual system can (and should) be improved by, well, approaching the problem from a rational stance seems more like a religious opinion to me than anything else. I am also not interested in engaging in ideological conversations, so I'll shut up.</p>

<p>Sufficient conditions for insurance being successful are:</p>
<ul>
<li>most risk pools don't rise sharply in risk over time</li>
<li>you maintain a moderately high level of capitalization instead of taking all your profits out of the business immediately (this ends up being ensured by regulation since otherwise it doesn't happen)</li>
<li>you keep an eye on the overall level of past risk of each of your risk pools</li>
<li>you're better at divvying up contracts into risk pools than most of your prospective customers (you can be arbitrarily bad at it as long as your customers are too)</li>
</ul>
<p>Real world insurance typically adds:</p>
<ul>
<li>you have most of the negotiation power to determine whether to actually pay out</li>
<li>customers are explicitly forbidden from using any hidden information to discriminate their risk better than you on penalty of losing their payout, so they have to compete with your experts with pure skill</li>
<li>there is an "acts of god" clause in contracts specifically exempting known and sometimes unknown large correlated risks</li>
</ul>
<p>to lower the insurer's risk further.</p>
<p>It is my understanding that the above conditions are how insurance actually functions.  Insurers have failed and been bailed out on certain occasions when their "acts of god" clause was insufficiently comprehensive.  (The phrase "too big to fail" may bring one such occasion to mind.)  This is a far cry from saying quantifying risk is a solved problem.</p>
<p>I don't think this is a reason to abandon all attempts to improve the process of awarding grants, but the problem space is very different from insurance and there's no off-the-shelf solution.</p>

Some will say "oh but anybody could do that, her expertise is not needed", and I hear them but disagree: the little things she chooses to emphasize I think are quite important from a certain perspective.  As she says somewhere in there, this is a math problem... without any numbers!  That's quite novel for most of her younger viewers, I suspect, and the kind of insight your average popularizer without the depth in pure theory, seems less likely to make.</p>
<p>The ongoing disaster in the US highlights in part the importance of social bonds across class, and what happens when they are not maintained.  I think it is important for scientists, including those doing even very abstract mathematics, to stay connected to this kind of thing and be proactive about engagement.  Wether or not the risk-metrics are really well-calibrated or not, keeping the public engaged in STEM is absolutely crucial for fighting back against efforts to undervalue science.  There was a time in the US when being a land-grant school meant something in terms of the work done at that school: it was agriculture related, the farmers actually <em>used</em> the research on some level.  When Dick Feynman put an O-ring in a glass of ice water he was standing up as a kind of "clever everyman" against the suits and bureaucrats who tried to sweep Challenger under the rug.  He was taking great pains to avoid being seen talking down to people as an "expert", or excluding them.</p>
<p>The blessing of government funded research is that it greatly increases the kinds of problems that can be worked on.  The danger of publicly funded research is that it gets all the experts talking to each-other on peer-reviewed panels, which is much more efficient and effective at certain ends, but inherently disconnects them from the public and industry, or at least risks doing so.  We have entered an age of populist authoritarianism, and things are going to get worse before they get better.  Many excellent people are going to have to reach outside of the usual grant system in order to get their work funded in the coming decades.  I may be preaching to the choir here, but I encourage everyone looking with concern at the funding situation in your country to embrace the discomfort and engage outside of the traditional systems.</p>

<p>Great point and thanks.  </p>
<p>I mean embracing more the pain that leads to growth — discomfort of public speaking, self-promotion if one is bad at that, and just generally engaging in things one isn’t good at, that point in this direction but don’t yet have an immediate measurable impact on one’s work, of dealing with social anxiety, etc.; things that are needed for public engagement.  I think for you (JB) these things are perhaps natural at this point, because public engagement feeds your curiosity which animates your work, but for many highly educated people these skills are perhaps less well honed.  Especially the kind of people who have been socialized to look down on “popularization”.  Everyone probably knows where their edge is after some honest reflection.</p>
<p>For Trump’s litany of unending bullshit and fascist tendencies I think the word is “accept”, as in “accept this is real and it’s going to get worse, possibly a lot worse”.  Several countries in EU might be only one election from the same thing happening there.  </p>
<p>For some people pivoting to “real world” work might be a solution.  For others really clarifying and focusing on what is the one thing they would want to accomplish in this life.  For all of us making sure to keep ties with communities that fulfill and support us will be crucial.  You know what animates you.</p>

<p>These things are all obvious from a certain point of view, so why am I prattling on about it… I saw an initial consensus on “politicization of science is bad, real impacts are good also hard” descend into bickering focused on some idealized problem of “how <em>should</em> grant funding work”. </p>
<p>Certainly if it is possible to make something useful to future reformers then please don’t let me stop anyone!  (Even just reaching a consensus among people in disagreement on “how we got here” might fit the bill.)</p>
<p>But failing that… I just wanted to emphasize that as far as I can tell the design problem we’d rather work on is not the one actually staring us in the face right now.</p>

<p>She gives many hilarious examples of how words like "inequality" aren't necessarily signs of wokeness in mathematics grant proposals, despite what Cruz's staff seemed to think.   The more serious part is an attempt to understand the anti-science stance lying behind the superfically anti-DEI stance.</p>

<p>Scientists, and mathematicians, generally tend not to be very politically active and focus their energies almost entirely on their science.</p>

<p>I'm sure this supports her overall point that the science flagged by the Trump administration does not actually contain anything relevant to the claimed goals of their censorship.

<p>I find it generally unconvincing that any of what is happening is about anti-science values and a rejection of complexity---as I argued in another thread I think the leaders of the fascist takeover are broadly also steeped in scientific-rationalist ideology. Marcolli even notes that DOGE has enlisted a bunch of STEM graduates from prestigious unis, but instead of taking this as a sign that maybe they are not ideologically anti-science, she only takes it as a sign that their anti-science plan is not based on ignorance and stupidity. </p>
<p>I find this point particularly indicative of an ideological blind spot --- Marcolli seems to find it more likely that a Caltech graduate will be “clever but anti-science” than “stupid but pro-science”!</p>

<p>I am much more convinced by the readings according to which this is a classic “revolutionary takeover of institutions”. <br>
The main point is not ultimately to defund science or whatever, the point is to force enough people that currently have the power to decide the allocation of science funding to leave, so that they can be replaced with loyalists.</p>

<p>The arguments are not total nonsense (they probably wouldn't have much of a hold otherwise)---it seems to be broadly true that these institutions have their own culture which they propagate independently of what is happening in politics, and that like every culture this has its own ideology; of course it seems to be nonsense that this ideology is woke, marxist, or leftist; it's probably not nonsense that this ideology is broadly opposed to whatever Trumpianism represents, and certainly not giving the kind of loyalty that they want as part of their new regime.</p>

<p>So “takeover by replacing people” is a sensible strategy if they want results quickly!</p>
<p>For comparison, we know that it is very unlikely that we can get category theory papers in Annals, and that this is based in culture and ideology, not in merit-based rationalism (it also doesn't mean that it's because the editorial board of Annals is full of crazy extremist ideologues). Suppose we all decide we want to change that. </p>
<ul>
<li>One way is to change things slowly: we start submitting our best papers to Annals even if there's a good chance they'll be rejected; meanwhile we adjust our research goals so that, if there is a chance that some Annals-worthy problem can have a CT solution, we try to work on that rather than on something which is “pure CT”; until one gets through, and then slowly things open up for us. That may take at least a decade.</li>
<li>Or we have the power to force people in the editorial board to resign, put a bunch of category theorists there, and then we can get Annals papers published tomorrow.</li>

<p>The counter-argument has some force, but we have to note that the Trump gang universally denies the science on global warming (that it exists, that it matters, that it's human-caused, etc. - different people may say different things), claims that wind power is more dangerous than coal, and that their government is now advocating taking vitamin A as a treatment for measles (in response to the measles outbreak in Texas due to under-immunization), and making other ridiculous claims about health and medicine.</p>

<p>I think it's not so much that they're "anti-science" as that they won't let science or facts stop them from doing whatever they want.  </p>
<p>On second thought, that's an exaggeration: they don't try to fly by flapping their arms.  So maybe they're just lacking empathy, and are willing to ignore science when it says someone else will get hurt.</p>

<p>Director of the National Science Foundation Sethuraman Panchanathan abruptly resigned Thursday, <em>Science Magazine</em> first reported.</p>
<p>Panchanathan, who goes by Panch, did not cite a reason for his departure, which comes as 16 months are left in his six-year term. However, like most other federal agencies, the scientific funding organization is awash in turmoil due to the Trump administration. Specifically, the NSF is facing a 55 percent cut to its $9 billion annual budget in the next fiscal year, as well as a mass layoff of half of its 1,700-person staff, according to <em>Science</em>.</p>

<p>My question was sarcastic.  Anyone whose agency is destroyed while they are heading it is likely to resign.  But yes, staffers from DOGE moved into the NSF on April 14th. Two days later, the NSF announced it was halting all new grants. Two days after that, it announced it was terminating about $1 billion in grants already awarded.   And now half their staff has been fired and Trump is trying to cut their budget in half.

<p>"Quantitatively, periods of unrest included many times more events of instability per decade and occurred when the population was declining, rather than increasing. Pre-industrial agrarian societies typically faced instability after one or two centuries of stability. However, a population approaching its carrying capacity alone is not enough to trigger general decline if the people remained united and the ruling class strong. Other factors had to be involved, such as having more aspirants for positions of the elite than the society could realistically support <strong>(elite overproduction)</strong>, which led to social strife, and chronic inflation, which caused incomes to fall and threatened the fiscal health of the state.[79] In particular, an excess in especially young adult male population predictably led to social unrest and violence, as the third and higher-order parity sons had trouble realizing their economic desires and became more open to extreme ideas and actions.[80]"</p>

<p>I'm also totally unconvinced by her analysis of fascism btw.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The historical fascism of the 1920s was an emergent phenomenon, a violent reaction against the rapidly growing complexity of modernity. Fascism is in essence an agrarian fantasy: the “sheaves” in the historical symbol of “fascism” hinting to an essentially rural idealization of society, rejecting complexity and urban modernity, pandering a mythological image of an unspecified past whose return is to be sought. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is true of the later Fascism movement and Nazism, but Fascism has its roots in Italian Futurism, that, as the term says, it is quite literally the opposite. People like Marinetti or D'Annunzio idealized modern technology like the car (just read the Futurist Manifesto if you have doubts), and in today's term they would be identified as staunch accelerationists. Their political idea was indeed to use any mean (violent or not, that is) to enact an accelerationist revolution.<br>
Indeed, many of the 'revolutionary fascists' of the first period (including Marinetti and D'Annunzio) were completely dismayed, saddened and disgusted with what fascism became in the second period (agrarian dream, strong clericalism, basically the opposite of what it was in the beginning), to the point of either being exiled, or going to exile by themselves (see D'Annunzio being basically confined in the Vittoriale).</p>

<p>If you want a simple, well-known, generally shared definition of what the ideological core of Fascism is, I suggest to go with Umberto Eco's one (totally not a fan of the guy, but this analysis is quite good):</p>
<ul>
<li>"The cult of tradition", characterized by cultural syncretism, even at the risk of internal contradiction. When all truth has already been revealed by tradition, no new learning can occur, only further interpretation and refinement.</li>
<li>"The rejection of modernism", which views the rationalistic development of Western culture since the Enlightenment as a descent into depravity. Eco distinguishes this from a rejection of superficial technological advancement, as many fascist regimes cite their industrial potency as proof of the vitality of their system.</li>
<li>"The cult of action for action's sake", which dictates that action is of value in itself and should be taken without intellectual reflection. This, says Eco, is connected with anti-intellectualism and irrationalism, and often manifests in attacks on modern culture and science.</li>
<li>"Disagreement is treason" – fascism devalues intellectual discourse and critical reasoning as barriers to action, as well as out of fear that such analysis will expose the contradictions embodied in a syncretistic faith.</li>
<li>"Fear of difference", which fascism seeks to exploit and exacerbate, often in the form of racism or an appeal against foreigners and immigrants.</li>
<li>"Appeal to a frustrated middle class", fearing economic pressure from the demands and aspirations of lower social groups.</li>
<li>"Obsession with a plot" and the hyping-up of an enemy threat. This often combines an appeal to xenophobia with a fear of disloyalty and sabotage from marginalized groups living within the society. Eco also cites Pat Robertson's book The New World Order as a prominent example of a plot obsession.</li>
<li>Fascist societies rhetorically cast their enemies as "at the same time too strong and too weak". On the one hand, fascists play up the power of certain disfavored elites to encourage in their followers a sense of grievance and humiliation. On the other hand, fascist leaders point to the decadence of those elites as proof of their ultimate feebleness in the face of an overwhelming popular will.</li>
<li>"Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy" because "life is permanent warfare" – there must always be an enemy to fight. Both fascist Germany under Hitler and Italy under Mussolini worked first to organize and clean up their respective countries and then build the war machines that they later intended to and did use, despite Germany being under restrictions of the Versailles treaty to not build a military force. This principle leads to a fundamental contradiction within fascism: the incompatibility of ultimate triumph with perpetual war.</li>
<li>"Contempt for the weak", which is uncomfortably married to a chauvinistic popular elitism, in which every member of society is superior to outsiders by virtue of belonging to the in-group. Eco sees in these attitudes the root of a deep tension in the fundamentally hierarchical structure of fascist polities, as they encourage leaders to despise their underlings, up to the ultimate leader, who holds the whole country in contempt for having allowed him to overtake it by force.</li>
<li>"Everybody is educated to become a hero", which leads to the embrace of a cult of death. As Eco observes, "[t]he Ur-Fascist hero is impatient to die. In his impatience, he more frequently sends other people to death."</li>
<li>"Machismo", which sublimates the difficult work of permanent war and heroism into the sexual sphere. Fascists thus hold "both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality".</li>
<li>"Selective populism" – the people, conceived monolithically, have a common will, distinct from and superior to the viewpoint of any individual. As no mass of people can ever be truly unanimous, the leader holds himself out as the interpreter of the popular will (though truly he alone dictates it). Fascists use this concept to delegitimize democratic institutions they accuse of "no longer represent[ing] the voice of the people".</li>
<li>"Newspeak" – fascism employs and promotes an impoverished vocabulary in order to limit critical reasoning.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many of these points can be for sure seen in current Trump's administration ideology btw. This comes from an essay dated 1995, and Eco died in 2016, before Trump's first term began, so you can be sure this definition wasn't made up just to label Trump a fascist.</p>

<p>This said, I do not think this matters much. My 2cents is that the US has a huge problem with scarcity of resources, elite overproduction and general decline of living standards and conditions (in part due to this, in part due to the super high income inequality). The result is a fight to the death between different factions which say that people in the other faction are killing the country for "reasons", and that do what they can to put the members of their factions in positions of power. In such a framework ideology is probably more performative than anything else. What really matters is that there are too many people and too little resources (think jobs, money, material goods, position of power). This won't end until the factor that caused this scarcity in the first place aren't solved.</p>

<p>Think about how many people want to pursue an academic career vs available tenure, for instance. And this is true in many sectors. Maybe you study years to become a programmer because 10 years ago it was the "way to go" and now you're jobless or earn little, outcompeted by foreign dev shops and/or AI. What all this creates is a very resentful elite overproduction: People that according to the social belief should be elite but aren't actually.</p>

<p>This creates a kernel of highly educated people that have all interest in overthrowing the current elite/system with whatever means. It was also one of the chief reasons behind the French Revolution btw: Bourgeois were doing all the work and producing everything but they weren't allowed to access nobility. Quite understandably, they decided to chop some heads at some point.</p>

<p>I'm almost happy to move on to what you say is your real point, but, like...the US GINI coefficient is about 0.4. GINIs in the EU rise as high at 0.35. The median household disposal income <em>after</em> transfers here is <em>still</em> 50% higher than in the EU. The 20th percentile American household has income analogous to the median Italian household. It's certainly easy to argue that the US has critical problems with inequality at the top, i.e. our oligarchs, or that you'd prefer to be poor in the EU over the US due to the more solid safety net, but it's comically inaccurate to claim that many, many Americans can't afford "even a hint" of material goods.</p>

<p>There are a few points:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gini coefficient in Europe is higher but Europe is made of very different countries. You can live well in eastern Europe with a salary that would be below average in Northern Europe, for instance. Checking within single EU countries would be more accurate, also because we don't have the mobility that Americans have</li>
<li>There's also the matter of consumerism. Since Reagan the US has had a very intense consumeristic boom. This is true also in the EU but people in the US tend to spend much, much more on goods than in the EU. This creates a given set of expectations. In a society where a. Consuming goods is considered a matter of status and b. People are constantly drawing comparisons with unaffordable lifestyles (thanks, social media!) even being able to afford basic/decent goods doesn't seem like enough.</li>

<p>TL;DR: If you convince a good part of the population that "they deserve more", where "more" means an unattainable lifestyle, they won't be content with what they have. Basically, there's a difference between real inequality (GINI) and perceived inequality.</p>

<p>A big problem with "facts" is that, if you consider them macroeconomically, they tend to give you a statistical picture that doesn't capture how people feel. With Biden the economy was growing, but many people felt in their ordinary lives that they were actually doing worse. So what happened there? Did the economy grew as a whole? Yes, but when you look closer, you see that average salaries/income went up very little, whereas billionaires made a BOATLOAD of money. So what really happened there is that very few people got unbelievably richer, whereas everyone else marginally improved their income, with a net negative result if you correct for inflation/rising prices.</p>

<p>I still believe my main points stand: Elite overproduction, income inequality and "too little things to distribute among too many people"are still the biggest causes of what is happening in the US and in the western world in general.

<p>I agree with income inequality being a (possibly the main) source of social unrest, as I find Gary Stevenson makes a very compelling case for it. However, I don't follow the argument about "elite overproduction" that you've repeated the most in this discussion. Society managed to support a much larger number of academics even ten years ago, so it doesn't seem "unrealistic" that a comparable number could be supported today, to contest one of your examples. What's your basis for this argument?</p>

<p>The US has many own-goals: a lot of the political "action" (read: screaming hatefully at everyone else) on the extremes of the right and the left harms the center, the social glue of a high-trust society, and the institutions that democracy (or even just political sanity) depends upon.  The ultimate responsibility has to lie with the US for what is happening.  </p>

That egregore uses ideology, be it futurist/fascist/communist/utopianist/whatever like an anglerfish uses its lure: a bright shiny bauble to lure in the unsuspecting bright-eyed youth and idealists.  Then two processes: a sort of digestion of society through demoralizing actions and rhetoric and violence, and also an escalation of privileges to move past the idealists to reach the more cynical and more powerfully-placed.  Once oligarchs (or some other powerful group) are onside/co-opted with this transformation, you get decapitation strikes, coups, and the ultimate betrayal of the very people and concepts the ideology-lure originally drew in.  Then the <em>really bad</em> stuff starts...  <a href="https://www.maksymeristavi.com/about">Maksim Erisatvi</a>'s bleak three-word summary of this process is apropos.  </p>
<p>IMO the more our societies are still in denial about ugliness in our own past, say colonialism or racial violence for instance, the easier this becomes: if you are emotionally committed to avoiding uncomfortable truths, you become easier to deceive or corrupt, all while perceiving yourself a victim.

In this sense science can be useful or a detriment to the egregore digesting society: a detriment because science seeks truth and openness, but useful if its productive capacity can be maintained while practitioners are lured into a distracted state of unhealthy skepticism and detail-orientation, where we cannot see the dark forest growing around us for the details of the trees.</p>
<p>Returning to Amar's point, this is to say that this perception of the "enemy" being simultaneously "too weak and too strong" is so common, perhaps, because it really is picking up on something.  Rarely is it to do with the specified enemy (often a red herring) actually being this way, but with demoralization and the nature of the more sinister forms of power.  We are in a liminal time in which we no longer accurately perceive what power and strength are.  People and organizations that by the standards of the old era seem weak or hopelessly incompetent, or self-destructively toxic, etc. are able to pull off coups and inflict tremendous damage from a position of "weakness", precisely because they are applying <em>different types of strength</em>.  So long as we fail to perceive these forms of strength as they are, we exist in a state of confusion.  In such a state, perhaps by Yoneda, the misattribution of paradoxical qualities to others merely witnesses this internal paradox.</p>

<p>Think about how many people want to pursue an academic career vs available tenure, for instance. And this is true in many sectors. Maybe you study years to become a programmer because 10 years ago it was the "way to go" and now you're jobless or earn little, outcompeted by foreign dev shops and/or AI. What all this creates is a very resentful elite overproduction: People that according to the social belief should be elite but aren't actually.</p>

<p>I agree with income inequality being a (possibly the main) source of social unrest, as I find Gary Stevenson makes a very compelling case for it. However, I don't follow the argument about "elite overproduction" that you've repeated the most in this discussion. Society managed to support a much larger number of academics even ten years ago, so it doesn't seem "unrealistic" that a comparable number could be supported today, to contest one of your examples. What's your basis for this argument?</p>

<p>Elite overproduction means you have more qualified people than available places for people with that qualification. If the number of available places goes down for whatever reason (e.g. cutting funds to universities in the case of academic position), then the probability of elite overproduction increases. So I don't see how your counterpoint is actually a counterpoint :/</p>

<p>"Overproduction" means "producing too many". The phrase implies that the education system is producing too many educated or qualified people, and "there aren't enough jobs now" doesn't support that point, since the jobs available are not a good metric for the needs (or even wants) of society. Medical research or nuclear facility maintenance in the US is a very clear example of this. So I'm asking you to justify the claim that there are too many """elites""".</p>
<p>There is already a term, "surplus" for when supply exceeds demand, which is not as loaded (although it has some similar problems in connotation). So if you prefer to argue semantics I would ask why you chose to repeat the particular phrase of Peter Turchin.</p>

<p>well, its both.  Many of those same companies cynically played to the perceived zeitgeist, because there was thought to be money in it.  (Some like UniLever might actually hold such values, but assuming that is a poor null hypothesis.) Now they have buyers remorse and get to wash their hands of it, while saving face.</p>
<p>For Trump its clearly a bit of an obsession, and with his base as well.  He is preternaturally good at predicting what will get him attention, and he's not often wrong about these things... there's a lot of bad history in the US and those are very important conversations.  <em>and</em> the deplorable strategy I witnessed on W coast US cities of brow-beating and intimidating people into silence, or allowing others to do for you, well, it has backfired tremendously... when you do not allow someone to speak their lived experience, no matter how coarse their words might be, you drive that frustration inside them, where it turns to bitterness and eventually rots into hate.</p>
<p>One takeaway message for everyone else in the world I hope will be: do not pretend issues are settled in society, just because you want them to be, especially if you are "in the right"!  This is inimical to democracy, and the alienation it brings, forms a foothold for every malefactor out there to "strangle you with your own system" as a certain Chinese saying goes.</p>

<p>Think about how many people want to pursue an academic career vs available tenure, for instance. [...] What all this creates is a very resentful elite overproduction: People that according to the social belief should be elite but aren't actually.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't follow the argument about "elite overproduction" that you've repeated the most in this discussion. Society managed to support a much larger number of academics even ten years ago, so it doesn't seem "unrealistic" that a comparable number could be supported today, to contest one of your examples. What's your basis for this argument?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elite overproduction means you have more qualified people than available places for people with that qualification. If the number of available places goes down for whatever reason (e.g. cutting funds to universities in the case of academic position), then the probability of elite overproduction increases. So I don't see how your counterpoint is actually a counterpoint :/</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Overproduction" means "producing too many". The phrase implies that the education system is producing too many educated or qualified people, and "there aren't enough jobs now" doesn't support that point, since the jobs available are not a good metric for the needs (or even wants) of society. Medical research or nuclear facility maintenance in the US is a very clear example of this. So I'm asking you to justify the claim that there are too many """elites""".</p>
<p>There is already a term, "surplus" for when supply exceeds demand, which is not as loaded (although it has some similar problems in connotation). So if you prefer to argue semantics I would ask why you chose to repeat the particular phrase of Peter Turchin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I used the phrase of Turchin because I think Turchin is right. The needs or wants of society are completely irrelevant economically unless someone can pay for them and they are sustainable. Society needs more nurses and doctors, obviously, but if the healthcare system is public and the government hasn't enough money to allocate to healthcare, then the available jobs will be limited. So yes you can definitely have elite overproduction in a situation where actual needs justify it. Needs are not economic demand.</p>

<p>On the contrary, if the healthcare system is private, but a plethora of economic factors are such that the pricing of that services makes them unappealing also with high needs, the outcome is the same. Economics is really convoluted and non linear, there are plenty of situations where everyone wants the same thing and yet there is no equilibrium nor agreement.</p>

<p>There's an interesting theory around this in the context of civilization collapse which has to do with energy return of investment. I'm quoting from wiki: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Energy has played a crucial role throughout human history. Energy is linked to the birth, growth, and decline of each and every society. Energy surplus is required for the division of labor and the growth of cities. Massive energy surplus is needed for widespread wealth and cultural amenities. Economic prospects fluctuate in tandem with a society's access to cheap and abundant energy.</p>
<p>Political scientist Thomas Homer-Dixon and ecologist Charles Hall proposed an economic model called energy return on investment (EROI), which measures the amount of surplus energy a society gets from using energy to obtain energy.[85][86] Energy shortages drive up prices and as such provide an incentive to explore and extract previously uneconomical sources, which may still be plentiful, but more energy would be required, and the EROI is then not as high as initially thought.[84]</p>
<p>There would be no surplus if EROI approaches 1:1. Hall showed that the real cutoff is well above that and estimated that 3:1 to sustain the essential overhead energy costs of a modern society. The EROI of the most preferred energy source, petroleum, has fallen in the past century from 100:1 to the range of 10:1 with clear evidence that the natural depletion curves all are downward decay curves. An EROI of more than ~3 then is what appears necessary to provide the energy for socially important tasks, such as maintaining government, legal and financial institutions, a transportation infrastructure, manufacturing, building construction and maintenance, and the lifestyles of all members of a given society.[86] </p>

<p>I think this si somehow connected to this context: A lot of societal needs are covered, for instance, by taxation. How much one can collect by taxes is directly connected to how much one can produce, which is directly connected to how much one can spend. So a decline in productivity in apparently completely different sectors can have an impact on things like, say, welfare. With more degrees of separation this is also true in the private sector, where some goods/services stop being produced because there isn't enough market for them, even if the need is apparently high.</p>

<p>My point is that saying "it's not true that we cannot have more academics, we used to maintain more in the past" really is a moot point. Do we _need_ more academics? Probably yes. Can we afford them? Most likely not, since if you draw a comparison to when, say, Reagan was in power the government and in general many institutions were way less burdened with debt, interest in the education sector was probably higher, etc etc.</p>

<p>I will jump in here and say that in general if a problem has not been fixed despite it seeming SO OBVIOUS … it probably really is non-trivial?</p>
<p>Rich people and corporate entities have options poor people do not and can afford to pay tax/legal/lobbying/market-manipulating professionals quite in excess of regulators to maintain such options.  Cf Panama Papers, the capital gains tax being lower than the employment tax for almost every bracket, and the way that the biggest US corporations in particular have managed to hold their wealth abroad and are not taxed very much on it (looking at you, Apple!)  </p>
<p>We can and should shout “corruption!” but words are not an enforcement mechanism.  Nor am I saying you should give up or not try.  But when the thing “we” are trying to effect can react and effect us back (say, back out of power)… well “non trivial” doesn’t even cut it!  </p>
<p>And that’s not even getting into the issue of wealth vs income, or regulatory capture, or diversion of government spending in ways that help economic elites, or black market / organized crime… or the concept validity of “we” out of context of the incentives of the game “we” are all playing.</p>

<p>You've made it sound very complex. Certainly the wealthy have a lot of resources with which to thwart attempts to redistribute their wealth, but conceptually what needs to be done is pretty simple: tax wealth.<br>
The problem of wealth held abroad might make this seem tricky, yet the US already manages to tax its citizens' income even if they reside outside the US, so a prospective solution to that already exists... and it could even stand a chance of being implemented as long as one lives in a democracy. Maybe.</p>

<p>Is there any example of a modern economy taxing wealth more-or-less successfully? The conceptual challenge with wealth taxes is very clear: it's easier to hide a stock (no pun intended) than a flow. That's true even when the stock is a big pile of gold, and of course when most large stocks are held as hypothetical paper gains in a market that can't actually sustain liquidating those gains, you get a whole new layer of rather extraordinary challenges.</p>

<p>Oh, I had missed that, I thought that private companies stopping their DEI programs was more of a case of "we are now free to do what we always wanted to do (+ we want to suck up to the Trump admin)" than something that the Trump admin was openly wanting to achieve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are right that many companies got rid of their DEI programs shortly after Trump announced his dislike of these.   UnitedHealth Group, MLB, Victoria’s Secret, Warner Bros. Discovery, Goldman Sachs, Paramount, Bank of America, BlackRock, Citigroup, Pepsi, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Coca-Cola, Deloitte, PBS, Google, Disney, GE, PayPal, Chipotle, Target and others scaled back or canceled their DEI programs even before April.   </p>
<p>But Trump also signed two executive orders banning federal agencies from contracting with companies that embrace DEI policies.  An example is LinkedIn: federal agencies dropped millions of dollars in contracts for LinkedIn services.</p>
<p>Then judges started issuing injunctions trying to stop the Trump administration from doing this.  Here's <a href="https://www.callaborlaw.com/entry/federal-court-puts-brakes-on-trump-era-dei-ban-for-contractors-what-california-employers-need-to-know">a story</a> from April 22nd:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Federal courts continue to navigate the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (“DEI”) landscape including Executive Orders targeting DEI. In a recent development last week, U.S. District Judge Matthew Kennelly granted a preliminary injunction against the United States Department of Labor (“DOL”) from enforcing the Executive Order titled “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing/">Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing</a>” issued by President Trump on January 20, 2025 that effectively bans DEI programs for federal contractors and grantees.</p>
<p>The ruling in <em><a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/chicago-trade-group-wins-injunction-against-dei-grant-terminations.pdf">Chicago Women in Trades v. Trump (N.D. Ill., No. 1:25-cv-2005)</a></em> extends a prior temporary restraining order, concluding that requiring contractors to certify non-participation in DEI programs likely violates their First Amendment rights. There, Chicago Women in Trades, a nonprofit that provides job training to women, challenged the requirement for contractors to certify that they do not operate DEI programs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not clear the Trump administration will follow the judge's orders.</p>
<p>Threats to federal funding for the University of California made my university flip-flop.    Until recently, UC required that any candidate for an open position write a "DEI statement" describing what they've done in support of diversity, equity and inclusion.  There were required courses for faculty on how to read and evaluate such statements.  Now there's a policy that <em>bans</em> the use of DEI statements.   The mandatory has become forbidden.</p>
<p>So far I'm not sure of pressure beyond words and "the power of the purse", but I expect that when the low-hanging fruit is picked, the pressure will increase on any remaining holdouts.  E.g. the Republicans could pass laws that forbid DEI (based on their usual argument that it's a form of discrimination).</p>

<p>We're getting there! That is exactly the essence of elite overproduction. There is an economic elite, wich is above everything else. There are a lot of people that would like to get there, or getting equivalent status. How do you do that? Historically there is a "cursus honorum" that brought people there, e.g. "get a degree from Oxbridge" was a pretty good starting point. So people pursued those careers, often exactly with the _expectation_ of being able to join said elite. So now you have a lot of Harvard graduates from whatever background that, say, try to join some hedge fund. Many of them won't be able tho, because demand is too high, and will have to go for something else. This creates lower and lower tiers of alternatives and, in the end, you'll have people that "I did all that I did to be part of this elite, and instead I end up working a shit job that doesn't respect all the effort I put into building my career nor my expectations".

<p>It's like you say: "Here's society's ladder. It's hard, but feel free to climb it." And it works for a while, but then as more and more people try to climb the ladder, it gets longer and longer, and increasingly many people end up falling, feeling they didn't deserve the fall. And everything seems more and more miserable.</p>

<p>This works at all levels: It's not necessarily the super-rich, in general a "healthy" society gives everyone the possibility to better their condition with the right effort. So maybe one is a peasant but studying hard enough lands a better job and guarantees a better outcome for their kids, and so on and so forth. As soon as this mechanism breaks down for entire pieces of the population, then it's game over and you'll have deeply unsatisfied people that basically want to overturn the system.</p>

<p>Now, on tax evasion, it's more or less what <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="280788">@Eric M Downes</span> said. </p>
<ol>
<li>Many times rich people do not own wealth, they own assets, often unrealized.</li>
<li>Sometimes these assets are overseas, so not taxable,</li>
<li>When they aren't they can be easily moved.</li>
<li>Taxing some classes of assets (e.g. unrealized assets) makes it very difficult to do business in a global context.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you say "let's tax the rich" then, either:</p>
<ul>
<li>The rich leave the country, and this is an economic problem since they're among the highest spenders, or</li>
<li>They find loopholes in the law (and they have the best tax lawyers around that move much faster than any government can do)</li>

<p>An example of this is Apple/Amazon. Let's break it down.</p>
<ul>
<li>Company X sells a lot in the US and doesn't want to pay tax.</li>
<li>X incorporates a subsidiary Y in Ireland, where IP taxation is like 1% or lower.</li>
<li>X moves all the IP of their product to Y.</li>
<li>X sells a phone in the US for 1000$, with a net profit of 800$. Instead of keeping the 800$ in the us, X pays Y a ROYALTY FEE FOR THE IP of 700$.</li>
<li>So 700$ are now taxed in Ireland at 1% and only 100$ pays corporate tax in the US.</li>
<li>
<p>Then, after being taxed, many things can happen: You can move them to Bahamas or whatnot through the NL, for instance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As soon as the EU or whatever will finally force Ireland to raise their IP tax (and they don't want to since Apple for instance hires I don't know how many people in Ireland in exchange of this favor), Apple's lawyers will deploy another strategy, and i'm sure they have 1000000 already figured out.</p>

<p>I mean as an entrepreneur in Europe I can guarantee that you have no idea how uselessly bureaucratic and complicated the process is. We spend like 20% of our time compiling useless forms instead of doing R&amp;D and building products, and this is true for pretty much any sectors (administrative load is sky-high also for academic stuff I'm told)</p>

<p>This is an intuitive model, but are you reasoning from past examples or from theory? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm just bullshitting.  I guess people call that "reasoning from theory".   Now I'd like to understand how the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Age">Gilded Age</a> ended.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>From 1860 to 1900, the wealthiest 2% of American households owned more than a third of the nation's wealth, while the top 10% owned roughly three-quarters of it.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Age#cite_note-61">[61]</a> The bottom 40% had no wealth at all.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Age#cite_note-Fraser-5">[5]</a> In terms of property, the wealthiest 1% owned 51%, while the bottom 44% claimed 1.1%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But what happened?   It seems there was a rise in labor unions, and a lot of violent attempts to suppress them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Starting in the mid-1880s a new group, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_of_Labor">Knights of Labor</a>, grew too rapidly, and it spun out of control and failed to handle the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Southwest_Railroad_Strike_of_1886">Great Southwest Railroad Strike of 1886</a>. The Knights avoided violence, but their reputation collapsed in the wake of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haymarket_affair">Haymarket Square Riot in Chicago in 1886</a>, when anarchists allegedly bombed the policemen dispersing a meeting.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Age#cite_note-75">[75]</a> Police then randomly fired into the crowd, killing and wounding a number of people, including other police, and arbitrarily rounded up anarchists, including leaders of the movement. Seven anarchists went on trial. Four were hanged even though no evidence directly linked them to the bombing.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Age#cite_note-TindallShe596-76">[76]</a> One had in his possession a Knights of Labor membership card.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Age#cite_note-TindallShe596-76">[76]</a> At its peak, the Knights claimed 700,000 members. By 1890, membership had plummeted to fewer than 100,000, then faded away.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Age#cite_note-77">[77]</a></p>
<p>Strikes organized by labor unions became routine events by the 1880s as the gap between the rich and the poor widened.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Age#cite_note-78">[78]</a> There were 37,000 strikes from 1881 to 1905. By far the largest number were in the building trades, followed far behind by coal miners. The main goal was control of working conditions and settling which rival union was in control. Most were of very short duration. In times of depression strikes were more violent but less successful, because the company was losing money anyway. They were successful in times of prosperity when the company was losing profits and wanted to settle quickly.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Age#cite_note-79">[79]</a></p>
<p>The largest and most dramatic strike was the 1894 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pullman_Strike">Pullman Strike</a>, a coordinated effort to shut down the national railroad system. The strike was led by the upstart <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Railway_Union">American Railway Union</a> led by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Debs">Eugene V. Debs</a> and was not supported by the established brotherhoods. The union defied federal court orders to stop blocking the mail trains, so President Cleveland used the U.S. Army to get the trains moving again. The ARU vanished and the traditional railroad brotherhoods survived but avoided strikes.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Age#cite_note-80">8</a>]</p>

<p>If these struggles indeed led to a decrease in wealth inequality after 1900, then I'd say this was short of a full-fledged revolution, but still a lot of strife.   (As far as I'm concerned that's better than a revolution, which usually involves a lot more violent death.)</p>
<p>Now I'd like to learn a lot more history about this and other ways that eras of high wealth inequality ended.</p>

<p>There was a lot of top-down work against the trusts of the Gilded Age, starting with the federal Sherman Act of 1890 that's being used against Google, Meta, and Amazon today, including the best part of the career of the great populist lawyer Louis Brandeis, and remaining a central interest of the Roosevelt and Taft administrations. While everyone hated the trusts, unions and strikes remained highly controversial during this period (i.e. my impression is that even respectable middle class progressives mostly didn't like them) and Debs, though by far the most successful socialist in US history, was never quite a truly serious candidate for President; I don't have a strong conclusion about what this means about the load-bearingness of the strike era, since even a relatively minor radical population might help scare the "normies" into a stronger response.

<p>Another important point: Much of the bettering of the working conditions for "common people" in the XX century, compared to the Victorian era, is due to the commies. In the west people were shit-scared that the Russian revolution could spread everywhere, and made many concessions (such as the 8hr work day) to mitigate the revolutionary impulse.</p>

<p>There are a lot of "non-socialist, but still better than we have today" movements that have been forgotten but are kinda resurfacing. One of these is Georgism, which I find very intriguing: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism</a></p>
<p>The idea of Georgism is very simple: Active income (e.g. the profit stemming from work) should be taxed very lightly, or none at all, whereas passive income (e.g. profit from renting land, revenue bering assets etc.) should be taxed heavily. I tend to agree with this position, as what makes the ultra rich so rich is precisely the vast accumulation of assets and property that generate passive income, esp. across generations. So basically you can stop working and do nothing, and you'll still end up generating more wealth than average Joe working a lot.</p>
<p>Since as I said some posts earlier money is not value, but a tool to determine how resources are allocated, this makes all the resources go to the superwealthy, leaving everyone else with very little. Now, I do not believe that being stinking rich is per sé morally bad, but I believe that wealth should be the fruit of one's work, and so I find the idea of getting passive revenue kinda unfair, esp if the passive-revenue bearing assets are inherited. Moreover, the productivity of society as a whole is inherently related to how much and how well people work, so a societal system that puts "passive income earning" above "get rich by working your ass off" is inherently doomed to slip into stagnation and decadence in my personal view.</p>

<p>Another interesting point: This kind of posture should be considered "as capitalist as one can get": What really matters is the fruit of your own work. And instead it's very frowned upon by neoliberals, which fundamentally believe in private property and in inalienable ownership much more than they believe in work. I find this contradiction really amusing.</p>

<p>I think there's a psychological trap whereby getting rich is encouraged but also getting rich <em>purely for one's own sake</em> is frowned upon and so the go-to justification for greed is: “I'm doing it for my children”; or in the absence of children, one will display generosity in gifts/charity. Remove that by making it really hard to inherit or gift, and extraordinary accumulation is displayed in its selfish nature. <br>
Not to mention that “get wealthy not for yourself but for your children” is also used as a moralised motivator for lower classes to accept the race, so it is quite easy for the upper classes to coopt the lower ones in opposing any action in this direction.<br>
This is why I think that, in fact, acting on gifts/inheritance would not only have the obvious “first-order” effect which is delayed by a few decades, but also a “second-order” effect in immediately making excessive accumulation harder to morally justify; but at the same time it seems incredibly hard to achieve politically, Japan is probably an outlier due to basically single-party system + enormous social trust</p>

<p>I am not sure moral justification is a strong point. It may be in societies that are collectivist in nature, but in many places the rich live among themselves, often in fenced boroughs, and barely know any "normal" person. So the "social shame component" is very much dampened. One just doesn't care about what others think if everyone is aligned in one's clique.</p>

For me, the best thing a rich person can do is fund some other person's effort, basically helping people with capital.

<p>That's an interesting idea but I'm unsure about how you propose to tax wealth in housing directly. Housing is even harder to liquidate than financial assets, of course! You run into all kinds of people complaining about granny whose Bay Area home is suddenly worth $3M when it was $7500 when she bought it in 1948 and she has no way to pay the taxes, and thus has to move to Wyoming or whatever. This is to some extent solvable, and indeed everywhere already assesses a certain amount of property tax; so are you basically just advocating for higher/more progressive property taxes with this point? This also does feel like it's stepping a bit towards Georgism, whose central thesis is that the <em>most</em> immobile asset is the unimproved value of land, and so that's the best thing to tax.</p>

<p>Welcome to Georgism! I agree with all these points. I also like Georgism from a moral pov: If you get rich from your own work, you kinda deserve it. What is less deserved is getting rich out of extractive practices such as rent seeking. Taxing land and similar assets has the effect of taxing extractive practices, and one can use this money to actually lower taxes on work, making society as a whole more productive. That taxing land is a good thing has been understood and advocated for by a lot of economists, notably even by people considered points of reference in the neoliberal school such as Adam Smith and Milton Friedman.</p>

<p>With app stores it’s quite debatable whether the monopoly is natural; the neo-Brandeisians in various cases like the one with Epic Games have been working on breaking the monopoly rather than just trying to tax it.</p>

<p>Thanks!  I'll quote a bit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apple’s response to the Injunction strains credulity. After two sets of evidentiary hearings, the truth emerged. Apple, despite knowing its obligations thereunder, thwarted the Injunction’s goals, and continued its anticompetitive conduct solely to maintain its revenue stream.  Remarkably, Apple believed that this Court would not see through its obvious cover-up (the 2024 evidentiary hearing). To unveil Apple’s actual decision-making process, not the one tailor-made for litigation, the Court ordered production of real-time documents and ultimately held a second set of hearings in 2025. </p>
<p>To summarize: <em>One</em>, after trial, the Court found that Apple’s 30 percent commission “allowed it to reap supracompetitive operating margins” and was not tied to the value of its intellectual property, and thus, was anticompetitive. Apple’s response: charge a 27 percent commission (again tied to nothing) on off-app purchases, where it had previously charged nothing, and extend the commission for a period of seven days after the consumer linked-out of the app. Apple’s goal: maintain its anticompetitive revenue stream. <em>Two</em>, the Court had prohibited Apple from denying developers the ability to communicate with, and direct consumers to, other purchasing mechanisms. Apple’s response: impose <em>new</em> barriers and <em>new</em> requirements to increase friction and increase breakage rates with full page “scare” screens, static URLs, and generic statements. Apple’s goal: to dissuade customer usage of alternative purchase opportunities and maintain its anticompetitive revenue stream. In the end, Apple sought to maintain a revenue stream worth billions in direct defiance of this Court’s Injunction.  In stark contrast to Apple’s initial in-court testimony, contemporaneous business documents reveal that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option. </p>
<p>To hide the truth, Vice-President of Finance, Alex Roman, outright lied under oath.</p>

<p>Since "homo" now is also a synonym of "gay" / "gay person" in English, I think that any mathematical term which uses "homo-" like "homotopy", "homology", etc is likely to be misinterpreted by non-mathematicians as being related to gay people, and then associated with wokeness.</p>

<p>Emily Riehl, whose NSF grant on Ted Cruz's list of "woke DEI grants" started this discussion, is not intimidated. She's giving a series of lectures across the UK, and she's coming to Edinburgh to give this talk on June 25th:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.icms.org.uk/events/2025/queer-math-and-queering-math-celebration-pride">Queer in math and queering math: in celebration of pride</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The LMS Hardy Lecture 2025</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Queer theory challenges essentialist or normative conceptions of identity, often using personal stories to show the limits of conventional categories. In this talk, Riehl shares her journey as a queer mathematician, tracing the formation of a pair of identities that were more often developed in parallel rather than fully integrated. In addition she will explore the recent "queering" of the concept of "identity" in mathematics, which enables a more expansive notion of mathematical equality than appears in traditional mathematical foundations.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>About the speaker: Emily Riehl has established herself as a leading expert in higher category theory and has also developed an interest in connections with computer science such as homotopy type theory. She is an accomplished and enthusiastic expositor of mathematics at a variety of levels aimed at mathematicians as well as popular writing with articles in Scientific American and New Scientist. She also plays a leading role in broader engagement of mathematicians and other scientists from marginalized and discriminated against groups. Emily played Australian Rules football for the US national team and is an accomplished musician.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>About the lectureship: The LMS Hardy Lectureship is named after G.H. Hardy, former President of the Society and De Morgan Medallist. Originally awarded to a distinguished overseas mathematician in odd-numbered years.</p>
