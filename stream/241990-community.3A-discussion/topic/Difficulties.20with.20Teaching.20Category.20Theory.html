<p>Didn't want to necro the old <a class="stream-topic" data-stream-id="241990" href="/#narrow/channel/241990-community.3A-discussion/topic/teaching.20CT/with/201064766">#community: discussion &gt; teaching CT</a>  topic, so thought I'd make a new one. I wanted to draw from the experience people here have had, and ask - what sorts of difficulties have people found from teaching category theory?</p>
<p>My guess is that these fall into 2 general types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Difficulties with actually learning the concepts within the material. For example, understanding functors and natural transformations, dealing with the significant abstraction present, getting skilled at unfolding definitions quickly. "How do I learn CT?".</li>
<li>Difficulties with motivation. For example, understanding why "thinking categorically" might be useful or appealing, finding problems which are either difficult or impossible without a categorical approach, and just generally justifying all the new language, terminology and diagrammatic reasoning. "Why should I learn CT?".</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, I'd also be interested in ways people have managed to successfully address these issues!</p>

<p>I am a big fan of the following 3-step process followed (implicitly) in Aluffi's <em>Algebra: Chapter 0</em>. </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Categories as organising containers -- </strong> Categories assemble "things of the same type", e.g., sets, groups, rings, etc. Aluffi defines some basic universal constructions such as objects freely generated from a set, products and coproducts. One can then ask what these are in each new category one encounters. </li>
<li><strong>Functors: passing from one container to another --</strong>  It becomes natural to figure out which of the structures considered in point 1 are preserved by which functors, which leads one to consider statements such as the one that right (left) adjoints preserve (co)limits. </li>
<li><strong>Categories as a theory --</strong> Here one starts constructing new categories and functors with properties one has by this point recognised as useful. E.g., AFTs provide adjoints. </li>
</ol>
<p>Step 1 addresses your first point: Abstraction is about avoiding doing the same thing over and over again afresh. Most students are happy to learn a + b = b + a and not 1 + 2 = 2 + 1, 2 + 3 = 3 + 2, etc. Similarly, I have found when I introduce point 1 above most students are happy to learn that quite technical and often unmotivated constructions like the free product of groups follow a general pattern. </p>
<p>Once one has completed Step 1, one should be sufficiently motivated to proceed to Step 2 -- thus addressing your second point --  because one recognises the utility of being able to say things like <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>π</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>:</mo><msub><mrow><mi mathvariant="bold">T</mi><mi mathvariant="bold">o</mi><mi mathvariant="bold">p</mi></mrow><mo>∗</mo></msub><mo>→</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant="bold">G</mi><mi mathvariant="bold">r</mi><mi mathvariant="bold">p</mi></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi_1: \mathbf{Top}_* \to \mathbf{Grp}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.5806em;vertical-align:-0.15em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">π</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.3011em;"><span style="top:-2.55em;margin-left:-0.0359em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">1</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.15em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">:</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.9303em;vertical-align:-0.2441em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathbf">Top</span></span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.0816em;"><span style="top:-2.4559em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mbin mtight">∗</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.2441em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">→</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8805em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathbf">Grp</span></span></span></span></span> preserves finite coproducts. </p>
<p>After this, in my experience, people either become hooked, and want to learn about AFTs, free cocompletions, Grothendieck constructions... or simply recognise the utility of categories in certain situations and move on to things they find more interesting.</p>

<p>I don't find teaching category theory particularly harder than other subjects: for example teaching the full modern version of the fundamental theorem of calculus seems harder, since it involves subtle concepts that the students haven't mastered yet.</p>
<p>However, teaching mathematics <em>in general</em> is extremely hard, which is why most professors are so bad at it, and only the most talented students survive.  I wrote some tips on teaching here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/teaching.html">How to teach stuff</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, rather few teachers notice that teaching is akin to acting, and learn the necessary acting skills to keep the students focused and eager to hear what comes next</p>

<p>Also, just to get a pet peeve of my chest. One of the worst things to do -- this turned off many of my peers from category theory -- is to make off-hand remarks when teaching Algebra, say, about how "of course, all this could be explained much more succinctly using category theory, but that would be <em>far</em> too advanced for this class", making category theory seem much more foreboding that it should be.</p>

<p>Regarding Aluffi, I start by talking about "categories of mathematical objects", which he calls "categories as containers", but I balance this with a lot of talk about "categories <em>as</em> mathematical objects", like how a group or a poset or a set with an equivalence relation is a kind of category.  I even talk a lot about the most important categories with 3, or 2, or 1, or 0 objects, and I draw these on the board.  This prevents people from thinking categories are just containers, "just a framework," with their <em>objects</em> being the object of interest.</p>
<p>If all the categories you know contain infinitely many objects, or worse a proper class of objects, you're more likely to think of category theory as abstract nonsense.</p>

<p>Okay, sorry.  "Categories as containers" is a very good term for that attitude toward categories.  I only got interested in categories when physicists started using categories in other ways.</p>

<p>I always draw and explain the initial category, the walking object, and the walking morphism.  Then I point out that these are the finite ordinals (= natural numbers) 0, 1, and 2, and I draw 3, and I mention that the finite ordinals, viewed as categories, are fundamental to modern homotopy theory (without getting into any detail - that might come much later).   Then I draw the walking span and the walking cospan, since those are the categories that come up in the definition of pushout and pullback, respectively.   Then I draw <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="double-struck">Z</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><mn>2</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbb{Z}/2</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathbb">Z</span><span class="mord">/2</span></span></span></span> (or more precisely the one-object groupoid <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>B</mi><mi mathvariant="double-struck">Z</mi><mi mathvariant="normal">/</mi><mn>2</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">B\mathbb{Z}/2</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05017em;">B</span><span class="mord mathbb">Z</span><span class="mord">/2</span></span></span></span>) and mention that any group can be seen as a one-object groupoid.   If I had time I might draw a more interesting lattice like the power set of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>3</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">3</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6444em;"></span><span class="mord">3</span></span></span></span>, which looks like a cube.   (This could come later when mentioning that a lattice is a poset with finite products and finite coproducts: it's nice to <em>draw</em> some  greatest lower bounds and least upper bounds, to give a more visceral feeling for products and coproducts.)</p>

<p>One example that left a strong impression on me as a beginner, I actually learned from Baez.</p>
<p>Finding the left adjoint (or lower adjoint) of the inclusion function <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>i</mi><mo>:</mo><mi mathvariant="double-struck">Z</mi><mo>→</mo><mi mathvariant="double-struck">R</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">i : \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6595em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">i</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">:</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6889em;"></span><span class="mord mathbb">Z</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">→</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6889em;"></span><span class="mord mathbb">R</span></span></span></span>.</p>
<p>This example was easy to understand (though hard to solve for me) and only got more illustrative over time as I thought about it.</p>
<p>Categorical properties corresponded to "mundane" properties (Being a "Functor" is a sort of monotonicity condition)</p>
<p>The input and output sets play an essential role in the solution.</p>
<p>There is soon enough context to discuss the adjoint functor theorem, which might excite mathematicians who are otherwise intimidated by adjoint Functors, but believe they're important.</p>
<p>And even here, getting to play with galois connections clearly conveys adjoint Functors are a sort of generalization of invertiblity, what Baez then called "the closest you can get to invertible". Which is easy to get excited about.</p>
<p>I find it very satisfying that there's so much to learn from just the inclusion function. Superficially it looks like "everything wrong with the categorical mindset", that we're making up objects just to waste our time converting between them. But if you get past this false impression, immediately you get rewarded with a magic trick.</p>
<p>It's a pretty little example of how you can learn new stuff by seriously contemplating and recontemplating simple things.</p>

<p>In category theory (and other abstract areas of science) there is something which is often overlooked, but which I find extremely, extremely helpful when teaching: </p>
<p><em>Category theory is often about giving names and context to patterns that you have already noticed.</em></p>
<p>The best way that I found to teach category theory is to bring the students, usually through examples, to a state where the structure or phenomenon that we are studying is "already in their head, waiting for a name". </p>
<p>For example, I tend to motivate the definition of a category as follows:<br>
<em>When we compose two functions, we get again a function. But we cannot compose any two functions, the domain of the second one has to be the codomain of the first one. The same happens with matrices and their multiplication. Think of other similar examples, for example from the following, if you are familiar with them: Markov kernels and their compositions, continuous functions, continuous curves in a space, relations, group homomorphisms. If you had to formalize the common pattern that all these follow, what structure would you define?</em></p>
<p>When I ask this, most people come up themselves with the definition of a category. (Or almost, some people drop the identities, etc.)<br>
You can do this also with functors, monads, monoidal categories, and so on.</p>
<p>Of course, the more advanced the topics become, the harder it is to find many examples. That's part of the challenge.</p>

<p>I am a big fan of the following 3-step process followed (implicitly) in Aluffi's <em>Algebra: Chapter 0</em>. </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Categories as organising containers -- </strong> Categories assemble "things of the same type", e.g., sets, groups, rings, etc. Aluffi defines some basic universal constructions such as objects freely generated from a set, products and coproducts. One can then ask what these are in each new category one encounters. </li>
<li><strong>Functors: passing from one container to another --</strong>  It becomes natural to figure out which of the structures considered in point 1 are preserved by which functors, which leads one to consider statements such as the one that right (left) adjoints preserve (co)limits. </li>
<li><strong>Categories as a theory --</strong> Here one starts constructing new categories and functors with properties one has by this point recognised as useful. E.g., AFTs provide adjoints. </li>
</ol>
<p>Step 1 addresses your first point: Abstraction is about avoiding doing the same thing over and over again afresh. Most students are happy to learn a + b = b + a and not 1 + 2 = 2 + 1, 2 + 3 = 3 + 2, etc. Similarly, I have found when I introduce point 1 above most students are happy to learn that quite technical and often unmotivated constructions like the free product of groups follow a general pattern. </p>
<p>Once one has completed Step 1, one should be sufficiently motivated to proceed to Step 2 -- thus addressing your second point --  because one recognises the utility of being able to say things like <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msub><mi>π</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><mo>:</mo><msub><mrow><mi mathvariant="bold">T</mi><mi mathvariant="bold">o</mi><mi mathvariant="bold">p</mi></mrow><mo>∗</mo></msub><mo>→</mo><mrow><mi mathvariant="bold">G</mi><mi mathvariant="bold">r</mi><mi mathvariant="bold">p</mi></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\pi_1: \mathbf{Top}_* \to \mathbf{Grp}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.5806em;vertical-align:-0.15em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">π</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.3011em;"><span style="top:-2.55em;margin-left:-0.0359em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">1</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.15em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">:</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.9303em;vertical-align:-0.2441em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathbf">Top</span></span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.0816em;"><span style="top:-2.4559em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mbin mtight">∗</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.2441em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">→</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8805em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathbf">Grp</span></span></span></span></span> preserves finite coproducts. </p>
<p>After this, in my experience, people either become hooked, and want to learn about AFTs, free cocompletions, Grothendieck constructions... or simply recognise the utility of categories in certain situations and move on to things they find more interesting.</p>

<p>If I may,  Cantorian abstract sets may be thought of as containers, but categories as containers may be obscuring much of what categories are: qualitative turn (cf. categorical mistake is comparing qualitatively different apples and oranges; of course, as fruits we can compare apples and oranges to our hearts' content).  Also, given that our ordinary conscious experience is categorical (e.g., cats, cars, people, buildings, trees, sounds et al. are all perceived as objects of corresponding categories), category theory is a welcome ever-proper alignment of reason with experience.  Since every object of a category partakes in the essence(s) characteristic of the category, morphisms between objects are necessarily structure / essence-preserving.  It might be of some use to highlight that category is not a (French ;) structural turn; categories are geometric objectifcation of concepts abstracted from particulars, thereby serving as theories, functorial interpetations of theories, and as backgrounds for these models.  Encouraged by the fact that a listing of properties of functions with respect to composition readily leads to category theory, we can start with even more elementary place-value notation for numbers, which when displayed as functions with geometric domains (places) and algebraic codomains (values), and readily recognize categories (not to mention the <a href="https://lawverearchives.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2003-FoundationApplicationAxioEd.pdf">self-foundation of domain geometry subsuming the algebra of codomain values as its subcategory</a>).  Unfortunately, functions in the then set theory didn't have codomains, while type theory didn't have domains; hence <a href="https://conceptualmathematics.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/categorieswhynotearlier.pdf">the delayed discovery of categories</a>.  Also, functoriality, without discounting the indispensability of functors in going across limited universes of discourses / categories, seems to be about compatibility with composition.  It is also not without value to introduce category theory in terms of trending things: for example,  a morphism between models (in the background of sets) of a theory consisting of m component objects and n component structural maps consists of m functions satisfying n equations, which can inform why divide-and-rule works: with compounding identities as component structural maps, it's difficult to change the status quo of the society.  In closing, unlike physics, with its shortest path, math (category theory) appears to have a thing for crooked paths, possibly a reflection of its makers (cf. <a href="https://conceptualmathematics.substack.com/p/crooked-timber-of-mathematics">Isaiah Berlin</a>).  P.S. [variable] algebra as an advance beyond [constant] arithmetic is understandably attractive, but even elementary arithmetic, say, <a href="https://lawverearchives.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1989.Milan_.categorytheoryinthefoundation.pdf">17 + 8 = 25</a> is loaded with content and waiting for humanity to contemplate (not only problems, but also the solutions that work so wonderfully).

<p>This is an interesting (and timely, for me) discussion, partly because I recently have been drafting a book on category theory together with many members of the ItaCa group, and also because every year since 2020 I struggle (the struggle being mainly due with my inexperience) with the task of teaching Category Theory to people who do not know mathematics. </p>
<p>In particular, working on the book, I have put a lot of effort in trying to convey an idea that I haven't found explicitly spelled out in any other reference, but that I believe we all agree upon, at least in its general form:</p>
<p>This is a category: <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>∙</mo><mo>→</mo><mo>∙</mo><mo>⇉</mo><mo>∙</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\bullet \to\bullet \rightrightarrows \bullet</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4445em;"></span><span class="mord">∙</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">→</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8558em;vertical-align:-0.1808em;"></span><span class="mord">∙</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel amsrm">⇉</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4445em;"></span><span class="mord">∙</span></span></span></span>. </p>
<p>But a category is also a "universe in which to do mathematics" --some would say it's a system of types. </p>
<p>But a category is also a simultaneous generalization of a partial order, and a monoid, meaning that every monoid is a category (bounding the size of the class of objects) and every poset is a category (bounding the size of the class of morphisms). One can fruitfully do category theory only embracing <em>all three points of view</em> at the same time, i.e. thinking categories as (combinatorial) shapes, as foundational universes, and as mathematical structures of their own specific kind.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="282822">@fosco</span>  the following, in light of the above, might be of some interest to you: <a href="https://conceptualmathematics.wordpress.com/2014/01/20/structure-and-natural-transformations/">It is not correct to say that a given category C 'is' a category of structures, because there may be many such representations (a similar subtlety with the 'is' arises in linear algebra: it is not correct to say that a vector 'is' a list of numbers because a given vector space has many co-ordinatizations (isomorphisms with suitable R^n).</a>  Simplistically stated, it's not unlike writing a number n as more than one exponential (n = a^b = c^d = ..., albeit not in the case of all numbers).  Professor F. William Lawvere explicitly states (i'll look it up) that a category C can be represented as  B^T or D^V or ... depending on what is taken as a theory and what is taken as a background for interpreting the theory to obtain models of the theory.  On a not too unrelated note: Consider the pure math modeling in terms of diagrams in the  category of Cantorian abstract sets.  This structure is essentially the only expression of whatever "inner essence" the dots may have.  From that point of view, a category is  special case of truncated simplicial set, i.e. using finite totally sets as (contravariant) diagram schemes and as "figure shapes" in any given category.  Two of the maps between  3 and 2 correspond to the domain and codomain structure of any category, whereas one map from 2 to 3 corresponds to the composition operation in any  category.  Then the map from 2 to 1 corresponds to the "inclusion" from the set of objects to that of the maps.  This inclusion should be understood in the same spirit as any inclusion map in category theory.<br>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276422">@David Michael Roberts</span>  The Lawvere Archives doesn't have a copy.  When I started teaching Conceptual Mathematics (CM), I requested Professor F. William Lawvere, along with many serious category theoreticians to be on the CM mailing list, along with the students, so that they can correct any mistakes I may make in my lecture notes I used to email a week in advance of my lecture.  All my questions and Professor F. William Lawvere et al. answers posted to the CM mailing list are archived at The Salk Institute (i'll see if i can find the website address / login et al).  I still vividly experience the gratitude I felt when many of the who's who of category theory answered <a href="https://conceptualmathematics.wordpress.com/2012/09/23/comfortable-with-shehes/">my nagging questions</a> <a href="https://conceptualmathematics.wordpress.com/2012/06/14/sum/">dating back to some 0.25 century</a> in a very helpful manner.  One of these days, if the religion of peace doesn't put life / humanity to rest in peace, I'll collect them all and organize and send it to Danilo Lawvere.  (I shared Professor F. William Lawvere &amp; Stephen Schanuel Objective Number Theory material I had, which will appear on the archives sometime soon given Danilo Lawvere's workload.)  I think the Lawvere family, especially Madam Fatima Lawvere, along with their grandchildren are already working very hard to make public all of Professor F. William Lawvere's unpublished work, the volume of which is beyond anyone's imagination if one only counts his published papers.<br>
P.S.  Cambridge University Press (CUP) is very eager to publish a book on Professor F. William Lawvere's seminal insights and expansive visions (such as): <a href="https://conceptualmathematics.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/perugianotes.pdf">a mathematical theory of the transformation of time and space into each other in a way more profound than that reflected in the notion of velocity</a>.  I don't remember what and when I wrote to CUP, if I did, but it looks like I have been marked on their mailing calender.  I think Gilbert Strang is heading the math unit at CUP, but I don't think he's into category theory (although I felt a kinship in reading him say in his zillionth edition Linear Algebra textbook: formulas have a place, but not the first place :)  If anyone of you are interested in working on CUP interest in Professor F. William Lawvere's brilliance, I'd be very happy!  (I'll try to find any emails i wrote to CUP and their invitations to submit a book proposal.)</p>

<p>I'm reading this thread right now as I start my first lecture on category theory in a few hours. My audience is going to be a mix of many different disciplines: a lot of engineers, some math majors, not completely sure what else. I'm interested in hearing some general advice.</p>

<p>Here's an opinion I'm working with: don't mention size issues in the first lecture. I'm planning to not even give a passing mention of small/large stuff. I think it would genuinely scare off non-math majors. The definition of category is so simple, but also immediately invites thinking about the foundations of mathematics. Engineers simply don't need to think about this, and mostly haven't been trained to.</p>

<p>I'm going to start with a flood of examples before I give the formal definition. I have to just touch on some because the list is too long, but I'll spend more time with a few. Here's the list I scribbled:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set</li>
<li>Mat_R</li>
<li>Vect_R</li>
<li>Metric spaces</li>
<li>Top</li>
<li>Man</li>

<p>Depending on time, I was hoping to define terminal object and (binary) product. I think these will be intuitive enough that I can ask them to start looking for those patterns inside this long list of categories.</p>

<p>I do find it interesting that you opt for going to "large" categories as your initial examples (if the list is indeed in some kind of order). In the terminology used earlier in this thread, that's "categories of mathematical objects", right?</p>
<p>Oh, and what approach are you taking for the product definition?</p>

<p>The way <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span> taught me co/limits is very intuitive. You draw the setup diagram and state existence and uniqueness of an arrow filling the gap. They should be comfortable with hearing about existence-uniqueness properties at the very least from their experience with ODEs. So I'm going to sorta pin universality to that on a conceptual level.</p>

<p>What do people think about the '7 Sketches' approach of not introducing categories until after preorders, monoidal preorders, categories enriched in monoidal preorders? I'm helping some people through the book and it seems to work well so far, though only beginning Chap. 2.</p>

<p>I'm an undergrad math major, and I'm informally testing the claim that "CT can be taught to anyone, even undergrads". I wish my uni had a course on CT for us!!</p>
<p>Re your original question, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="934428">@Ruby Khondaker (she/her)</span>, if you take me as one data point, I can tell you the following (I've reversed the order of your 2 types):</p>
<ol>
<li>Motivation. I'm super motivated globally: thinking categorically is ALREADY enabling me to think more clearly and organize all the different and ridiculously voluminous demands on my time and energy. But  I'm having trouble with local motivation on two levels:</li>
</ol>
<p>(a) life: the burning question I'm unable to answer yet is: how might CT be able to help me pass my upcoming math methods and modeling module (Jacobians, modeling, equations of motion, up to angular momentum) ?? I'm way behind on that work and the final is in June :(  I can <em>feel</em> a pattern in what I'm learning there, and I've tried to map it out, but am so far unsuccessful. This is one of my self-given CT exercises.</p>
<p>(b) learning: that is, for specific concepts, the bulk of motivating examples are how to solve problems in math, which I can't understand. I'll call this "the example wall". I haven't even taken the pure maths module yet (next year, if I pass this module)!  This is where I think APPLIED CT is really powerful. If you're talking about an adjunction, for example, what [insert non-math prior knowledge domain here] problem can motivate this construction? I'll talk a little more about the potential power of ACT later.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Concepts. I also have this problem, as evidenced by my (let bigons be, due to <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span> )<a href="#narrow/channel/229199-learning.3A-questions/topic/How.20to.20learn.20about.20.22courbes.20immerg.C3.A9s.20dans.20une.20surface.22/with/568388778">bigons question</a> (though that's not strictly CT, I've more examples). I'll call this a "learner's gluing problem" (does the concept exist already?): <br>
(a) Is the concept I'm reading about in one book the same as what I'm reading about in another paper? <br>
(b) What is the current state of the concept that this early author wrote about? <br>
(c) Does this one word/phrase mean the same thing or different things for different authors? There are at least 3-4 flavors of <strong>Poly</strong> that mean different things -- what's the difference between them?<br>
(d) This one has been really fun for me to learn: Symbols! Notation! Different authors use different glyphs for the same concept, and the same glyph for different concepts! In "plug and chug" math, the notational conventions are relatively standard, and so this was a huge thing I had to get my head around. It takes a lot of time to sort through. However, that "sorting through things" is precisely how I've been able to learn how to explore definitions, and is one of the strengths of what I call <em>adventure learning</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>But this problem (2)  is related to my next point. I would propose adding one more type and making that the second type.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Guidance. This comes embedded in the context of university, and why I wish there were an intro to CT at mine, at my level! Many of my problems with concepts come from not having access to a teacher/syllabus/direction on <strong>WHAT to learn</strong>. As mentioned, I am self-guided (I'm not a self-taught person! I'm trying to figure out my list of topics by anchoring them to things I already know and/or love. I'm definitely NOT self-learning because I'm learning from many of you here, asynchronously and without traditional classroom-type interaction), but I'm having to come up with my own syllabi (syllabuses?)? And my related difficulties have been:<br>
(a) What is the corpus of "basic" category theory for people who want to apply it?<br>
(b) What, formally, IS "applied category theory" anyway? <br>
(c) How would you or anyone know whether I've applied category theory successfully?</li>
</ol>
<p>As a note: After a long time, hard work and serendipity, I have found a tutor and he's amazing!! I've gone to him with a very specific topic, so the Guidance Problem still stands for me. I also owe him a HW problem set that I'm behind on :P </p>
<p>So here is an idea, which I have from previous related experience in a different context, and where I come back to the power of <strong>A</strong>CT. The abstractness of CT makes it so that there's something for everyone! An idea might be that, before the course/module starts, maybe try to ask students </p>
<ol>
<li>What are specific things they like/ are curious about / have to learn about from any part of their life? (robots? the USS Enterprise? yin yoga? medieval castles? Jane Austen novels? Polish grammar? etc.)</li>
<li>Within those topics, what are questions/challenges they have?</li>
</ol>
<p>From there, maybe pick a few that resonate with the most people (or if a small enough class, they can use their own examples), and then design specific motivation and then the list of examples around that.</p>
<p>Has anyone tried or tested this in the CT context? Maybe the education community has studied the phenomenon of teaching specific things to learners of mixed prior knowledge. Maybe ask someone studying childhood education (I would say I'm probably around 4 or 5 years old in CT/mathematical maturity)?</p>
<p>I've had loads more thoughts on the dual of your question (including how on earth to get credits for what I'm learning extra-curricularly -- some kind of network of university partnerships?), but I think this turned into quite a long message, so I'll stop there with the hopes that it helps someone who is teaching or writing CT textbooks :P</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I would say that the extent to which category theory <em>might</em> be helpful here is giving you tools to work with functions. One way in which CT helped me with more elementary math was just making me an expert at manipulating functions, which is a generally good math skill.</p>
<p>For example, I remember struggling a lot in undergrad about change-of-basis matrices, where figuring out whether I needed <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>P</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">P</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">P</span></span></span></span> or <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>P</mi><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>1</mn></mrow></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">P^{-1}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8141em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.13889em;">P</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.8141em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mtight">−</span><span class="mord mtight">1</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> took a nontrivial amount of effort each time. When you're in the thick of a lengthy calculation, that's the kind of mental effort you don't want to expend.</p>
<p>But category theory provides a nice alternative perspective on bases! Given a (real) vector space <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>V</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">V</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.22222em;">V</span></span></span></span> of dimension <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">n</span></span></span></span>, a basis of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>V</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">V</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.22222em;">V</span></span></span></span> is equivalent to a <em>chosen</em> isomorphism <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>α</mi><mo>:</mo><msup><mi mathvariant="double-struck">R</mi><mi>n</mi></msup><mo>→</mo><mi>V</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\alpha : \mathbb{R}^n \to V</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.4306em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.0037em;">α</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">:</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6889em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathbb">R</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.6644em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mathnormal mtight">n</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">→</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.22222em;">V</span></span></span></span>. This is part of a general theme where, in category theory, you care <em>how</em> two things are equal, not just <em>that</em> they are equal. Representing linear maps by matrices then comes by "conjugating" the map with the basis isomorphism, and change of basis maps can be determined by drawing commutative diagrams involving the basis isomorphisms.</p>
<p>On a related note, I always found it a little difficult to wrap my head around active vs passive transformations, which is crucial for Noether's theorem (where symmetries correspond to conserved quantities). It helped when I realised that it's best to think of such symmetries as mapping <em>functions</em> to <em>functions</em> - given a single solution (which might be a function from time to space, so a trajectory), you act on it by a group element to get another solution, so another function. That's where being familiar with currying and uncurrying can help, i.e. the natural isomorphism <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext>Hom</mtext><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>B</mi><mo>→</mo><mi>C</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>≅</mo><mtext>Hom</mtext><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>A</mi><mo>×</mo><mi>B</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>C</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\text{Hom}(A, B \to C) \cong \text{Hom}(A \times B, C)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord text"><span class="mord">Hom</span></span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathnormal">A</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05017em;">B</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">→</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07153em;">C</span><span class="mclose">)</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">≅</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord text"><span class="mord">Hom</span></span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord mathnormal">A</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span><span class="mbin">×</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05017em;">B</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07153em;">C</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span>.

<p>Yes I think this can be difficult to avoid in general. Seven Sketches is a good place to see examples of ACT, and if you're into programming I highly recommend Bartosz Milewski's lectures - they helped me gain a lot of intuition for category theory.</p>
<p>I'm not sure I have good answers for your other questions, but hopefully this can be a good place to start.</p>

<p>Ruby's <em>might</em> is important. You shouldn't expect CT to be relevant to every aspect of your life, or even to be obviously helpful for everything you study in maths. If takes researchers significant work to make such connections in the first place, if they exist at all. Expecting everything to slot neatly into one way of thinking, or even trying to fit everything into a one framework (whether CT or something else) is not something I would advise. See where it can help you, but don't expect it to necessarily help everywhere.</p>

<p>Indeed - one very important thing I learned from Category Theory is that there's often not "One True Perspective" on anything. Instead, it's helpful to have <em>multiple</em> perspectives, so long as you have ways to translate between them. Of course, that doesn't mean every perspective is equally valuable - I don't think we need a middle ground between flat earthers and... everyone else - but it does mean that trying to find a "canonical" perspective isn't always the best idea. It lines up with how I've become less interested in finding a "Grand Unified Theory" as I've done more physics, especially within condensed matter where you use multiple perspectives all the time!</p>
<p>But of course, you have to apply this to the categorical perspective, too. There's no axiom of math which says the categorical way of thinking is the "One True Perspective" on all of math; and to me that's a feature, not a bug! I don't imagine category theory would've been much help in discovering the Einstein tile, for example, but that's one of my favourite recent mathematical discoveries. I'm definitely of the opinion that CT is more widely applicable than people might think, but I also try to remain grounded and not get too caught up into turning everything into a functor or whatever.</p>

<p>When I was focused on mathematics, I knew category theory was an important language, but I wasn’t motivated to learn it. The problems I cared about could be expressed easily without this formalism. My motivation only emerged when I moved into proof assistants and programming languages. Bartosz Milewski’s lectures and book were decisive for me: the idea of using category theory as a programming-language-independent way to talk about computation was exciting. Bob Coecke's books and articles on categorical quantum mechanics were also motivating to learn category theory, especially because of the nice diagrams describing quantum protocols. It felt similar to developing coordinate-free differential geometry, i.e., synthetic geometry.</p>
<p>After understanding category theory through (classical and quantum) programming, I began applying it back to mathematics. The Serre–Swan theorem, in particular, became a major motivation for me to keep going.</p>
