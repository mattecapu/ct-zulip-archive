<p>Concerning my citation of Valerie Solanas, that was not an AI hallucination, but a fascination for problematic authors. Nevertheless, I have my limits: if an author is antisemitic, like Julius Evola, that is a big no-no for me to use it as reference, because his work has been poisoned. Nevertheless, Solanas's work is satirical, his enemy is the "patriarchy" is a concept rather than concrete people. It is true that Solanas did murder a man named Maurice Girodias, but she was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. In other words, this murder was not the result of her intention, but of a mental handicap and people who are handicapped should not be discriminated against. This is the reason why I give Solanas a pass: she was mentally ill, not evil. People who were really evil and advocated for violence unapologetically: Adolf Hitler (yimakh shemo), Karl Marx, Martin Heidegger (specially in the Black Notebooks).</p>
<p>Now, I could ask the question: Is Kanye West evil like Hitler or just mentally ill like Solanas? I don't know Kanye, but I'm sure Nick Fuentes is pure evil and shouldn't have a platform.</p>

<p>I generally deny that the distinction between "mentally ill" and "evil" is sharp, though in rare cases like Tourette's syndrome one might entirely escape culpability for an otherwise evil act. Solanas managed to write a whole manifesto calling for violent resistance to the patriarchy, and then acted on her prescriptions. She was both mentally ill and evil.</p>

<p>My goal is to argue that automation is a crucial tool in dismantling the patriarchy. I initially drew on the work of Valerie Solanas, who advanced a radical critique of patriarchal society. However, if her position proves too controversial or problematic for my purposes, I can instead turn to Laboria Cuboniks, the collective behind <a href="https://laboriacuboniks.net/manifesto/xenofeminism-a-politics-for-alienation/">Xenofeminism</a>.</p>

<p>My reply were the attached slides in which I apply the techniques of xenofeminism to fight contemporary antisemitism. Yes, I used AI to produce it, but it is not spam, the slides really reflect my ideas about technological activism. Of course, this is just brainstorming.<br>

<p>I'm not at all likely to read an AI-produced slide deck about the applications of xenofeminism to combatting antisemitism. It's remarkable that you don't seem to be willing to make any of your own arguments, though you claim that your goal is to "argue..."</p>

<p>If that was true, how did the AI knew that these two ideas (xenofeminism and combating antisemitism) can be combined? The process of generation of AI-enhanced content starts by telling the AI my arguments and then asking it to develop slides illustrating my ideas.</p>
<p>My main argument is that teaching advanced critical theory (critical race theory, gender studies, postcolonial theory, etc.) to people without enough reasoning skills was catastrophic. As a consequence of that, a significant part of the "woke" movement became antisemitic, because antisemitism is the easy (and wrong) answer to complex questions.</p>
<p>Xenofeminism is an alternative to the "woke", aiming to solve the same social problems, but it is grounded on logic and critical thinking. So, if the woke is generating antisemitism, a good idea could be to replace it with xenofeminism. Indeed, unlike the woke that is obsessed with hating people who they consider to be "privileged", xenofeminism promotes inclusion of everyone.</p>

<p>Well, playing devil’s advocate, so far you haven’t said anything that would prefer xenofeminism over, say, liberalism, which is also, or claims to be, based on logic, critical thinking, and inclusion of everyone. Indeed it’s a rare school of thought in the enlightenment heritage that denies critical thinking and inclusion, though a few deny logic!</p>

<p>I would prefer xenofeminism over the "woke ideology", because xenofeminism is anti-essentialist, whereas the woke is obsessed with identity (for example, gender identity, racial identity, religious identity, etc.).

<p>Thank you! I’m still getting up to speed on xenofeminism, as it’s a field I’ve only just started exploring.</p>
<p>I’ve been conducting statistical research on contemporary antisemitism, and I’ve come across a nontrivial result: <strong>the spike in antisemitism in Canada didn't actually begin as a reaction to the Israeli military response following the October 7th attacks (2023). Instead, the data shows the increase began during the COVID-19 vaccination campaign (2021).</strong> My interpretation is that people were heavily indoctrinated through online spaces during the pandemic.</p>
