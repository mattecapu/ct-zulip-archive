<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I’m currently doing my MSc in quantum information and entanglement, but I’m planning to pursue a PhD exploring a more foundational line. My focus is on contextuality: presheaves already capture the tension between local coherence (consistent distributions within commuting sets of observables) and global impossibility (no single assignment works for all contexts).</p>
<p>What I want to explore is how to go beyond descriptive power, towards <strong>formal certification of quantum advantage</strong>. The idea is to develop <strong>computable cohomological invariants</strong> within a topos-theoretic framework, which could act as <em>certificates</em> of contextuality and be directly testable in simulations and quantum learning experiments (e.g., Q-learners).</p>
<p>In short: can we frame “quantum learning advantage” not just as an empirical observation, but as something we can <em>prove</em> and <em>verify</em> through categorical and cohomological methods?</p>
<p>What do you think? Any suggestions, references, or directions you would recommend?</p>

<p>Also: <br>
Contextuality and Quantum Learning Advantage</p>
<p>Neural Sequence Learning: A study showed that quantum contextuality enables a separation in memory capacity between quantum and classical recurrent models. This leads to quantum models outperforming classical ones on tasks like language translation, which inherently involve contextual dependencies <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14353">arXiv</a></p>
<p>Inductive Bias and Expressivity: Research demonstrated that contextuality in quantum models allows them to encode conserved quantities in their label space, enhancing their expressivity. This was shown through a toy problem involving zero-sum games, where quantum models outperformed classical counterparts <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01365">arXiv</a>.</p>
<p>Communication Complexity: Quantum contextuality has been linked to advantages in communication tasks. For instance, certain quantum protocols exhibit reduced communication complexity compared to classical ones, highlighting the role of contextuality in efficient information processing <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03308">arXiv</a>.</p>

<p>The old work by Isham and Döring is practically all I know, except for Abramsky's later paper.    I wrote about their work <a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/week257.html">back in 2007</a>, starting here and then getting into details:</p>

<p>I mainly mention this because Isham is one of the gurus of quantum gravity, profoundly interested in philosophy... so I was surprised, at the end of our talk, when he showed me into a room with a huge rack of computers hooked up to a bank of about 8 video monitors, and controls reminiscent of an airplane cockpit.</p>

<p>Thanks for the mention! fwiw <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/samuel.staton/papers/infocomp2017.pdf">our idea</a> that perhaps you're referring to was just to try to bring different things together in one topos, including Isham et al, Abramsky and Brandenburger, and effect algebras from quantum logic. They all sit inside the presheaf category [FinSet,Set] as a sort of "gros topos". Flori and Fritz also looked at [KHaus,Set].</p>

<p>Thank you very much for the excellent suggestions. My impression is that there are very few researchers working at the categorical or cohomological level who are simultaneously engaged, or even interested, in applied research in what is now being called 'quantum learning theory'. These domains still appear rather distant from one another</p>

<p>I understood that the mentions of presheaves and cohomology referred to the work in the Abramsky-Brandenburger framework (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1102.0264">founding paper</a>, some cohomology <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1111.3620">here</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03097">here</a>). There's also the cohomological stuff by Raussendorf and others (e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11631">this</a>). However, I don't know of works where either of these strands is connected specifically to learning.</p>

<p>Yes, that's what I thought. I would be a bit nervous because I don't know of much categorical analysis of ordinary computational learning theory. But maybe there's something different to analyze about the quantum case.</p>
