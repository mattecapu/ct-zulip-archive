<p>I was interested in what Nina said about mentorship .... I dont have PhD students at the moment, so I would have a bit of capacity to mentor students on the undergraduate/graduate level ... I am also interested in what Jade said about students who are interested in category theory but do not have access to category theory inside academia ...</p>

<p>The Department of Mathematics at Pomona College will offer an eight-week residential program to conduct research in pure mathematics. The program, entitled PRiME (Pomona Research in Mathematics Experience), will run from June 9 through August 4, 2019. The program is directed by Edray Goins (Pomona College) and Alex Barrios (Carleton College). During the eight-week program, students will work together on research projects in arithmetic geometry.</p>

<p>I was wondering whether it could make sense, for people who would like to volunteer to do this, to explain in a short sentence what our particular background is, so that once we set up some mentoring scheme, we could be matched with students or academics that have gone through or are going through a similar path. I appreciate that this might mean that we might reveal some potentially very personal things about ourselves that we have not previously shared, but in the spirit of what <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275899">@Christian Williams</span> said yesterday it could be a first step in making this platform more about the people in ACT, and maybe even more importantly, to make this community even more about the people who are in it. If we want to do this, I think that it would be important to agree to some level of confidentiality, in that sense that personal details shared here for the purposes of mentorship would need to remain on this platform. This might be problematic to enforce, and so what I suggest might not be feasible. I am curious to hear your thoughts on this.</p>

<p>I personally feel privileged enough that I find it unlikely I would make a good mentor in the sense of representing (and therefore being a relatable role model) for someone from a minority group. However, I suspect that description holds for a <em>majority</em> of people potentially reading this, and that's a lot of empty hands who, based on earlier discussion, may struggle to help without putting some amount of organising burden on someone else.</p>

<p>So let me float an idea: How would people feel about a dual mentorship scheme? People from MGaB and NAoM already run the kind of mentoring scheme that was being discussed, and (I suspect) we don't have the diversity of background here to provide massive manpower to that kind of scheme. But what we have here in this community is a lot of expertise and interest in category theory specifically. So how about organised collaboration? We pair willing folks here with someone who is already willing to act as a mentor with a relevant background at MGaB or in NAoM. By supporting them, they might be able to take on two mentees instead of one (for example). Meanwhile, we learn and engage with their mathematical interests while enabling them to engage with category theory through us, laying the foundation for the kind of collaboration that Dr Abrams is describing in the tweet quoted above. And by getting involved in a thoughtful way (that I hope enough people are conscientious enough to manage), we can learn about the experience of minority students without imposing our guilt on them.</p>

<p>If those you get in touch with at Mathematically Gifted and Black are receptive to the idea, I would be happy to put some of my own time into assisting with organisation and logistics of it.</p>

<p>A beautiful thing I learned from working with the developmentally disabled is the power of the team approach for helping people. I certainly can't teach category theory, but I could be a person with street credibility who could join in the learning process. Also I know what good running systems look like and I'm still connected with people inplementing them.</p>
