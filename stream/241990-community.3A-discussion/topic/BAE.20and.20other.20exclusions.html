<p>As an outsider, really enjoying this conference it is not my place to criticize. But I would really like to hear people's opinions, on how an engineer working for BAE presenting, fits with the general values of the community. In particular, since this is a panel tomorrow.</p>

<p>I'm sure some people will raise this question tomorrow.   It's good to think about whether you want to ban talks from people who work at "evil" corporations, and if so, how "evil" will be determined.   </p>
<p>For example, there was also a talk from Alberto Sperazon at Honeywell, and many talks by people who get funding from the US Defense Department.   </p>
<p>Also: what would you think about a talk from someone who works at Facebook, or Google?</p>

<p>I'm not sure what is being implied here, but whatever you may think of GTRI—everyone is entitled to their own opinion—Catlab is not a product of GTRI. It is an open source project, which for most of its early history was developed by me in my spare time as a grad student. Lately it has gathered more users and contributors, for which I am grateful, and I hope that will continue. In general, open source projects do not and cannot dictate who gets to use them or why. In that respect, OSS is perfectly analogous to mathematics.</p>

<p>It's shades of grey, until you hit the end of the scale. BAE are literally complicit in ongoing war crimes that are well documented. You can probably find more openly evil organisations than BAE, but you'd have to search quite hard</p>

<p>I would have found it helpful if you had said this explicitly. It's really easy for text to get misunderstood, or misused when you don't make your intentions clear. I made a pun connecting "toothless" regulations to the idea of regulators wanting to bite people, and even that got misconstrued. This has re-enforced my feeling that literal is normative for text.</p>
<p>One of the things I love about this forum is that nobody hides behind plausible deniability. I know that wasn't your intention. But I only know that because ambiguous comments like these are rare, so you have de-facto credibility. While it's up to everybody how to speak, I'd like to encourage the norm of literalism.</p>

<p>Sounds like a Sorites' paradox when you put it that way. As I understand it, this kind of paradox comes up when you pick an aspect of a situation that doesn't have enough structure to capture the distinction you are trying to draw. </p>
<p>If I understood <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275901">@Jules Hedges</span> correctly, he's particularly concerned about the company's involvement with war crimes. Maybe there's a sophisticated way to address this concern, without collapsing the details to a scale of evil (I know Dr Michael Stone, who hosts the show "Most Evil" and built an "evil scale". Even according to him, it's not a one dimensional phenomenon).</p>
<p>While war crimes aren't completely well-defined, they are a fairly well-defined concept. Well defined enough that involvement in war crimes could be addressed with their own separate procedure from other forms of "evil."</p>

<p>I wasn't trying to claim it's impossible to draw a line.  I wasn't trying to play a "sorites paradox" game.   I just want to know roughly where Jules and others want to draw the line - and also what the line <em>amounts to</em>.   Is Jules saying that Steve Huntsman should not have been allowed to give a talk?   And if so, what should be the procedure for banning certain speakers?</p>
<p>Personally I think  might actually be better to do what we're doing, which is let people who work for morally dubious companies give talks... but then have a forum where we discuss the moral issues.    For example, it'd be great if Jules (or anyone) gave a little presentation about what BAE Systems is doing.

<p>I wasn't trying to claim it's impossible to draw a line.  I wasn't trying to play a "sorites paradox" game.   I just want to know roughly where Jules and others want to draw the line - and also what the line <em>amounts to</em>.   Is Jules saying that Steve Huntsman should not have been allowed to give a talk?   And if so, what should be the procedure for banning certain speakers?</p>
<p>Personally I think  might actually be better to do what we're doing, which is let people who work for morally dubious companies give talks... but then have a forum where we discuss the moral issues.    For example, it'd be great if Jules (or anyone) gave a little presentation about what BAE Systems is doing.   That might accomplish more than just - perhaps rather quietly - banning speakers from this company.</p>

<p>I'm sorry, I didn't mean to suggest that you were playing a "sorites paradox game" –– I meant to say that the idea of drawing "a" (singular) line at a "level" of evil can make thinking about the problem harder, because it draws one's attention away from other salient aspects of the issue. </p>
<p>Asking "how many grains of sand" form a "heap" draws attention away from the contextual use of the word "heap" and the morphology of a three-dimensional pile, etc. </p>
<p>Asking about "lines" and "evil" draw attention away from facets of the situation. For example <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275965">@Evan Patterson</span> raised the issue how open source projects are structured, which is highly salient to how a mathematical community receives and disseminates information. Another example is the (presumably) default view of <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275901">@Jules Hedges</span> that we should not invite people from organizations affiliated with war crimes. But as an open community, that does not stop these people from learning and using our tools. How does the vitality of open communication weigh against the desire to keep it secret for fear that it will be misused? Even if we all accept the basic premise that war crimes are unequivocally evil, there is a lot left to be desired from metaphors about lines and scales. </p>
<p>Maybe I'm wrong about this, and there may be a valid reason for thinking in terms of lines and levels of evil. I was just raising my concern.</p>

<p>I think these things take time and finesse. I'm new to this community so I don't feel entitled to push for particular outcomes when so many others have so much more invested here.

<p>In addition to the option of banning people, banning logos, or leaving things as they are, one additional concrete option is to require that people who work for certain kinds of organizations have to explain themselves to a critical audience as a condition of participation. Let's call that the "roast" option. It's not a strong solution, but at least it would build a culture of reflecting on our actions––if that's what people think is important. (I see both sides of the issue. Some people might be thinking "my god, this is a maths forum, what is all this baggage doing here?")</p>

<p>My stance is that the ACT community should steer away from companies involved in war crimes like BAE, or making a business by fucking people's rights and privacy like Amazon or Facebook. I don't think it's enoguh to talk about this (even if it's good to do so). Following Ostrom, we really have to give negative incentives if we want the community to steer away from stuff like that.</p>

<p>In my view, "must" is a natural concept. Apples "must" fall when unencumbered. People make choices and choices are the subject of moral language such as "should."</p>
<p>If you want to use these words differently, that's fine by me. However, criticizing peoples' statements on the grounds of single word semantics is a highly error-ridden way to interact.</p>
<p>I disagree with the antagonistic way you chose to question my vocabulary. People often have internal semantic frames that you aren't aware of.</p>

<p>Also, I can agree that military funding may be bad or not depending on the context. But I think that some things are undisputably bad, like  Nazism and their race theories, slavery, or killing people for fun. For me, things like "bombing the red cross" really fall under this category</p>

<p>Hi all. I've thought about these issues a bit, and I also think that they're important, so here are my two cents. I'm less shy when writing into a box than when talking into a box <span aria-label="laughing" class="emoji emoji-1f606" role="img" title="laughing">:laughing:</span></p>
<p>I can see the temptation to ban certain speakers based on their affiliation, but my current tendency is to say that this would be going too far. The contemporary pervasiveness of de-platforming and blocking dissenting views seems to add to the creation of filter bubbles and to the sectioning of society into disparate parts with no understanding of each others' thinking and actions, and is in my perspective going too far. My worry is that excluding certain people would contribute to that. But given that, I'm also all in favour of voicing concerns openly as <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275901">@Jules Hedges</span> has done, and if possible also discussing them with the very people who have those questionable affiliations. (I did this in personal conversation with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277578">@Steve Huntsman</span> at last year's UCR meeting. I disagree with his personal decision, and I would personally never accept funding let alone employment from BAE, but I think that he deserves a chance to explain himself and to hear people's concerns in a respectful conversation.) So <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276438">@Fabrizio Genovese</span>, if you know Steve personally, have you talked to him about your concerns and <em>asked</em> him why he works for BAE?</p>
<p>On a related note, I think that there's a difference between letting someone speak and <em>endorsing</em> any of what they say or do. For example if BAE Systems was a conference sponsor, then this could already be considered much more of an endorsement, and would constitute an affiliation with the <em>entire community</em> rather than just with an individual member. I would also be very uncomfortable with that, and I strongly support <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277067">@Tom Leinster</span>'s actions with regards to the conference's original sponsors. I would feel similarly about Facebook or Google.</p>

<p>Yes, I am aware of the "Han vs everything else" issue in China. And I agree, it's bad. Still, collaborating with Chinese academics can serve a different purpose.

<p>Indeed, there is a vast rift between allowing anyone to <em>promote</em> BAE and allowing someone simply affiliated with BAE to speak. Talks at a conference are much more controllable than pulpit speeches at university debate societies.</p>

<p>Well, I told you above, the idea that such companies exist clearly disgusts me. And I'm seriously puzzled regarding why Steven works for them. I've met him, he's a nice guy. So either his moral standards are really low (but I don't think this is the case frankly) or something must have happened to lead him to choose to work for them.</p>

<p>One way to think of this is that some people think of being a "good person" as being a person who others would want on their team, and who others wouldn't mind as an enemy (MLK, Ghandi, pacifists, etc.). Another concept of being a "good person" is being a person who you want on your team, and who you really do not want as an enemy (Marcus Aruleus, Roosavelt, Churchill). Still others think of being a "good person" as being a person who is useful to his or her group (insert famous physicist from WWII era here).</p>

<p>I said this in an email a little while ago. My view is, like many here, that we should not give BAE space to give a talk, nor possibility to fund our conferences.<br>
However, everybody has a different "ethical line". Especially since we meet to discuss, let's please not turn the meeting into a "my line is better than your line" debate. We will not convince other people this way, especially not by rational arguments. <br>
(All these lines are arbitrary, and there is no "transitivity": the only perfectly consistent lines would be "funding from all, including nazis" and "no research at all". Some of you talked about degrees of separations already...) <br>
We won't achieve anything by just telling the others that we are right and they are wrong - except dividing the community like a political party.<br>
And please, let's make sure that throughout the debate nobody feels attacked or impeeded to voice their own idea (for being "evil", "inconsistent", or anything else). Let's respect and hear everyone's opinion.</p>

<p>This begs the question: "why does someone choose to work for an evil organization?", which clearly demands some context. Indeed, plausible answers could be "Because the person in question has low moral fiber" as well as "because the person in question was literally starving and couldn't find any other opportunity", which are on quite opposite ends of the spectrum</p>

He regularly taught Heiddeger and defended it on the grounds that his contributions to philosophy were very important, and it would be rewriting history to expunge his academic contributions. The open practice of citation in academia is professionally sacred in a way similar to the imperative to do no harm for doctors.</p>
<p>Excluding people, however, is another matter. There are many cases where this makes sense. Although it should depend on context. There may not be many reformed fellons in academia, but I wish there were (in America, committing a crime is a path fixing event akin to becoming lower cast in rural India). In my opinion credibly reformed people should always be allowed to participate in the pursuit of knowledge.</p>

<p>So, here's my opinion about this: If someone's dead, well there's nothing really we can do. All things considered it's better to act in an utilitarian way and use the work produced. If someone is alive, then the situation changes. We can ask this person for clarification, and act accordingly</p>

<p>Also, I think there's a little flaw in the "big contributions" argument, that I hear ad nauseam: Suppose there's some academic that is insanely good, but also a total asshole. Like, a legendary one. When evaluating the impact on the community, we shouldn't just take into account that person's accomplishments, but also how many people were actually excluded from the community because of them (e.g. people being so uncomfortable that they changed field altogether). When you factor this consideration in, things change imho, and there are very few scientists whose orverall impact would still turn out positive.</p>

<p>That is, you may have created great maths, but you probably also destroyed a lot of potential math by making other scientists walk away. This is rarerly considered in the usual "but he's done great things" argument.</p>

<p>Here's an interesting case that I'd like to mention, mainly for fun and without wanting to suggest anything either way.</p>
<p>Bill Lawvere worked for an intelligence think tank in 1962, and there he ended up writing the manuscript that founded categorical probability! His job there was apparently in the design of protocols for arms control—but who knows what other people there did.

<p>Bringing it back and explaining why I have such a strong reaction to this: there are already purity tests in this community. I have never had what happened to me happen at any other venue during the review process, where I was called "coy" for not discussing at length the possibility of UAVs being used in "remote warfare" because in the acknowledgments they saw my indirect funding came from Northrop and SERC. This is completely unacceptable and it shows that the community is split. If you want to do anything practical (in the US at least) you need to indirectly touch military funding.</p>

<p>I mean... we're talking about Western educated people whose opinions get more entrenched when they go abraod... I just think that should be clear. It is what it is, and that's why it'a a good one to think about. These historical examples are easy in hindsight, but then when there's a close analogy now, it illuminates why people struggled with these issues back then and why we continue to struggle with them.</p>

<p>The real questions of engineering ethics are about how you design and build systems within a process that honestly and thoughtfully engages with the real-world effects of those systems on people and the environment. Auditing the funding to avoid contamination is not a substitute for considering the effects of your engineered systems.</p>
<p>For example, my research is designed to help government scientists get accurate and reliable modeling and simulation results to inform the analyses and recommendations that they make to policy makers. I think that policy makers will be better off if they are informed by science and that science needs to be available when they need it most, which is during a public health or national security crisis. Now, as a scientist, whether the policy makers use this information to make good or bad decisions is beyond my control, but I want them to have the resources and information available to make the right decision at the time the decision needs to be made.</p>

<p>My critique is this: how do <em>you</em> know that many of them "completely agree with the politics of their government"? What is your definition of "completely agree"?

<p>As the wiki I've linked to pointed out, Korean ethno-nationalism derived from social Darwinist ideas in Meiji-era Japan. Social Darwinism was pretty much a pandemic idea prior to WWII.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span>  I regret using the word evil now. It's too loaded.</p>
<p>Regarding where to draw the line: yes, that is exactly why I asked the question. I do not have a good answer to this.  Funding from the defense department is hard to avoid in the US (even Chomsky lamented that he was a hypocrite in this sense). And you are right, there are many concerns with Facebook/Google as well (privacy concerns, military contracts, ..). And working with/inviting people from these companies is almost unavoidable in applied math.</p>
<p>For me at least, a military R&amp;D company like BAE falls very much outside of 'the line'. I was very sad to see someone speak about the kind of math that we do, knowing for what it is ultimately used. We, in a relatively theoretical field, have a chance to be more selective about who to let speak (than, say, engineers). And I think we should use that chance.</p>
<p>Banning of certain companies, in general, is I think not as controversial as you make it sound. I'm sure there is a line that you would draw somewhere as well? Would you, say, let an engineer from Marlboro speak? A logistics manager from Blackwater (now Academi)?</p>
<p>Because this question is so hard, I'd like to see people's opinions.</p>

<p>This is actually science that you can justifiably call "bad". Because neural networks are functions parametrised by data, their outputs are influenced by the shape of the data, which has all sorts of biases. So yes, we can exclude them on the basis of the poor quality of the science. In fact, we should study, and people have studied, why the poor quality of the data leads to poor outcomes from these ML projects.</p>

<p>with respect to the original BAE thing, my thoughts are (I think) very similar to Jules’: you don’t need to be able to define when exactly a pile of sand becomes a heap to be able to say that there’s a lot of sand in the Sahara. I know that lots of people seem to feel very strongly about no-platforming as something anti-democratic or whatever, but, to me, the situation is now that BAE can unequivocally say “oh look, we’re part of the ACT community”, and this makes me very reluctant to identify as a member of the community myself. I’m not going to pretend that the community would be missing out on anything if I left, but I guess it boils down to this: is the pursuit of pure mathematical knowledge more important to this community than the human element of the community (and the world at large)?</p>

<p>and, to me, the “worst” case scenario of trying very hard to avoid associations with things like BAE is that category theory research gets set back by 20 years or whatever because we exclude some great minds, all “just” to try to make this community seem as compassionate as possible</p>

<p>but, to me, the “just” part of the above is so much more important. if you want to be purely utilitarian, think (as previously alluded to) how many more great minds would come to the field at the “cost” of cutting out war-crime companies. on a much more human level, is category theory research progress really worth more than our moral and ethical responsibilities towards other human beings?</p>

<p>I think that’s all I have to add. It might seem overly idealistic and “hippy” as an attitude, but, from personal experience, these debates between mathematicians usually lack somewhat these sorts of opinions, and tend more towards “let’s be rational logicians”, so hopefully this might resonate somewhat with some people</p>

<p>This was basically Grothendieck's point of view: IHES was damned in his eyes because it took money from the French ministry of defence. I mean, it's great now that IHES has no military sources of funding, but maths lost the input of Grothendieck along the way.</p>

<p>Having weapons companies present is not pro-discourse per se. </p>

<p>Tim was arguing that having someone from BAE signals that BAE is part of the ACT community, which TIm finds distasteful. I find that an anti-discourse stance. I get that it'd be morally wonderful not to allow anyone with affiliations to weapons companies to participate, but it's still stifling discourse nonetheless.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would be an anti-discourse stance if we were at a, say, a conference about 'Ethics in engineering', to disallow BAE to participate. We are at a math conference, and unless the issue is brought up (as is in this thread, which is fantastic I think) there is no discourse. BAE gets to associate with ACT (for the outside world), and to advertise working with them (to the participants).</p>

<p>Sure, but according to Tim, that's not good enough. According to him, those companies should never have been given a chance to show up at the conference in the first place. That's why I called that view "anti-discourse".</p>

<p>I did not say that. <br>
Tim said no-platforming was anti-democratic. I disagreed and argued that it's actually anti-discourse. <br>
What <em>you</em> are now saying is to give BAE a platform but allow others to have a discourse about why it's undesirable. <br>
That is <em>not</em> no-platforming: no-platforming means BAE should never have been here in the first place. That was what Tim was arguing should have happened.</p>

<p>And sure, if the community decides it is going to no-platform anyone who works for any objectionable company, for a community-decided value of "objectionable", go for it. But it is still an anti-discourse stance. It is also VERY democratic.</p>

<p>I think that "lots of people _seem to think_" is pretty clearly not a statement equivalent to "lots of people _definitely think, and I have statistical evidence_". I never (intentionally) implied that you thought it was anti-democratic. However, "<em>nobody</em> ever said that no-platforming is anti-democratic" seems an odd take... it's a view I've come across quite a lot. <br>

<p>I want to hear about military applications of ACT because it will help me understand ACT as it actually exists in the world.  I don't sympathize with the position that we will reduce ACT's military application simply by not hearing about it in our conferences.  Seems kind of like a "shoot the messenger" type argument.  Sure, it does help BAE to have them at our conference.  But the evil we do by helping them in this way is negligible compared to the evil BAE is doing in the world in its material operations.  And it also helps us understand the state of ACT as it is exists in the world, rather than a sterilized version where we get to pretend that it isn't going to be applied to anything evil.</p>

<p>I agree with Joshua that "keeping all the nasty organizations out" has disadvantages as well as advantages.   It means that the nasty organizations (who by the way have lots more money and resources than us) will read our papers, build on them, but never talk to us - so they'll do their own work never encountering criticism from us.    </p>
<p>If instead we had a public session where we discussed the ethical issues raised by the various talks at ACT, "nasty organizations" will get to hear scholars saying they're doing nasty things.</p>

<p>The good publicity they get from speaking at the conference would be negated by the bad publicity of a YouTube video where scholars discuss their evil deeds.</p>

<p>I wasn't trying to make it sound controversial.  When I asked "would you ban X, Y and Z?" it's because I wanted to actually know people's answers to those questions - it wasn't a rhetorical ploy.  I haven't gotten many responses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sorry, misinterpreted that. So, to give a concrete answer: yes, at the beginning of the thread I was of the opinion that banning talks from weapons manufacturers is a good first start. This was under the assumption that these talks would happen in a vacuum, and not be accompanied by a thorough discussion (as we are seeing the beginnings of, in this thread).<br>
I think your suggestion to give people the chance to give a short "context talk" for <em>any</em> corporate talk would be fantastic. This would result in an effective ban of companies like BAE though, I think. They probably would not want a spotlight put on their company's history, scandals, and general business ethic.</p>

<p>I think we can take an automata approach to the values. In essence, there are some initial carefully selected behavior assertions from which certain desired outcomes are made inevitable. From an organizational analysis standpoint, those organizations which are stagnant and lacking integrity have one key quality—a high trust sparsity and, consequently, a low transparency. By simply asserting that people must take actions to foster and maintain a <strong>trust-dense</strong> environment, we get rid of an entire class of degenerate organizational states. And things like a code of conduct naturally, implicitly fall out of that. If a person does something to harm another person, this reduces trust density, and thus violates the positive assertion. </p>
<p>Another quality is that of making <strong>room for excellence</strong> in all of its forms. An innovative knowledge-based organization/community will always find a place for talent. If excellent or potential for excellence is turned away, then this is a sign of degeneracy. With some way to gain a sense of whether such individuals do in fact make their way into the community and are allowed to contribute, this is a sign of health.</p>
<p>A final thing to note is that efficient organizations take a <strong>fractal structure</strong>. Since this community has at its core the use of category theory as a tool for extracting patterns from wherever they are and incorporating them into a larger theory, we should see this behavior in how we engage with the physical world as well, to include people. After all, mathematics is a mental tool used by our mental processes, and we are also those mental processes coupled together. </p>
<p>In short, the organization as an automaton can allow for thinking about a minimal set of positive assertions from which desired behavior and monitoring of degeneracy can manifest. Two major ones are to take actions to foster trust density and to assimilate excellence in all of its forms. The efficient organization has a fractal structure, so let these mathematical tools be a guide on how to build, maintain, and navigate the world as a community.</p>

<p>I really like this approach! It's simple, yet principled, and doesn't let out of sight something very important: Without common sense, any CoC, law or policy turns very rapidly into a perversion that does more harm than good. So we should indeed act to mantan trust and build a culture of applying common sense wherever possible.</p>

<p>The simplest definition of <em>evil</em> is really that it tends to be characterized by <strong>zero-sum</strong> behavior. So again, by simply requiring positive-sum behavior, you also get rid of many degenerate cases. This one has less obviously general utility than the others because sometimes things actually are zero-sum and one must act according to that. Even so, zero-sum behavior is a warning sign.</p>

<p>Picking holes in and throwing sarcastic retorts at legitimate opinions until someone loses the will or emotional energy to argue back seems pretty anti-discourse to me</p>

<p>And your so-called moderation isn't anti-discourse? </p>
<p>I'm frankly quite sick of your heavy-handed interventions as well. Didn't <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="275920">John Baez</span> say to use a light touch? Why are YOU constantly blaming ME for tantrums that other people are throwing because THEY disagree with me?</p>
<p>People disagree with each other, often vigorously, all the time on online forums. People have left conversations because they don't want to engage. It's THEIR choice.</p>
<p>And if you wanted to police that, why did you not go after <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="285161">Oliver Shetler</span> after his comments led to someone deactivating their account? Oliver <a href="#narrow/stream/241990-general.3A-values/topic/BAE.20and.20other.20exclusions/near/203352472">laughed about that</a>. I got a PM from that guy saying the discussion was "unreadable": it was. </p>
<p>Why did you not go after Oliver for having literally caused a former member of the community to head for the exit? He and I literally discussed that on here yesterday. </p>
<p>Isn't that a double standard on YOUR part? Because it sure as heck is looking like that to me right now.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276424">@Rongmin Lu</span> I did not laugh about that, and this is another instance where, to me, it feels like you are misquoting me. I have noticed that others such as <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="280178">@Tim Hosgood</span> have also felt that you misquoted them, and that you have felt misquoted by him. As far as I can tell, you are the only person who regularly gets into these sorts of misquotation conflicts with people.</p>
<p>I want to put that here in the public record, because misleading comments can dammage peoples' reputations. I get that what I said felt exclusionary to you, and I've been thinking on my own time about what went wrong and how I can improve my conduct in the future. If you had reached out to me with receptive intentions (publicly or privately), you would already know that. </p>
<p>I would also like to note that someone had already reached out to me early on in the conversation (when it was just me and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276438">@Fabrizio Genovese</span> ). In response, I clarified what I had intended for the comment to mean privately (and this satisfied the concerned person). Then I attempted to delete my comment (which really amounts to minimizing it) so that the concerning comment could be left aside. I felt that if it could be concerning to people, it was appropriate to take it down.</p>
<p>However <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276424">@Rongmin Lu</span>, you excavated the comment and quoted me, so I restored and tried to clarify the comment. I feel that this sort of baiting was unnecessary, and provocative. The deletion should have been an indication that I felt the comment was unnecessary.</p>
<p>I regret that I wasn't able to de-escalate the conversation after that. I felt caught between publicly defending myself and wanting to empathize with you <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276424">@Rongmin Lu</span>. Perhaps I ended up failing at both by trying to split the difference. </p>
<p>This is the last thing I will say publicly on the subject, except to defend myself from these sorts of comments. If you have an honest interest in helping this community become more welcoming, while still retaining its moral backbone, please reach out to me privately to discuss. I am more than happy collaboratively resolve this conflict if you are willing.</p>
<p>And if anyone also felt concerned about my comments or <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276438">@Fabrizio Genovese</span>,  <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276424">@Rongmin Lu</span>and my conversation, I would appreciate your private constructive feedback as well.</p>

<p>Yes, but a light touch hasn't worked.   You keep becoming aggressive - your comments now are a great example.    </p>
<p>The moderators will have to figure out what to do here.    So far we'd been able to avoid the need for serious moderation.</p>

<p>Back to the original discussion, I have also expressed my personal opinion to some people, but here it is also publicly: I believe that any individual is of course free to be employed or be funded by some company or other organization (I have myself been indirectly funded by US military, and my personal thoughts about that are, I believe, not relevant to this discussion). But when it comes to community actions of endorsement, be it as receiving sponsorship for the ACT conference and exhibiting a logo or provide a public slot which serves, at least partly, as advertising, we need to be extra careful (and yes, personally I am happy with the decision to take down the logo and I would also suggest not allowing BAE in the industry showcase. On the other hand, a researcher of BAE could potentially submit a talk to the ACT conference!). Of course as discussed above, this has to do with each person's individual lines, and we <em>ought</em> to be more informed about the involvements of companies in suspicious matters (this is a criticism to myself as well, as I was not aware of the company or its military engagements before the issue arised) and then open our doubts to the community in a respectful discussion. Since there might be a wide range of opinions on such matters, I am also `happy' to leave the final say to the local committee - since a decision needs to be taken.</p>

<p>I like this.  I hadn't thought about it much until now, but the phrase "industry showcase" suggests that the speakers are <em>exemplary</em> in some way, and that may set a higher bar than just a typical talk.</p>

<p>I don’t think that’s what industry showcase implies. To me having been to engineering venues where they have booths from bae and raethon and Grumman it only showed that hey these are some people in industry that are interested in category theory. Logos and such should probably stay for the sponsors however</p>

<p>My expectation is that the industry showcase would show how they used category theory to solve some problem of theirs that they traditionally used other methods for. Less of a technique showcase as some of the talks were, and more of a "what was accomplished". At least for the larger (more traditional) companies.</p>

<p>The industry showcase talks certainly didn't have time, in 8 minutes, to go into any technical details.  I think the goal was mainly to notify us of the existence of these companies...   and perhaps the opportunity to work with them?</p>

<p>Yes, I got the sense of the "opportunity to work with them" aspect. That did come through the presentations. </p>
<p>I'm looking through my notes now. I'd say they did do what I expected based on the notes I took. The talks went so fast, it was a blur (that's why I take notes!).  I do remember feeling the final talk given was a bit low level for what I was expecting. But it did show how they began the process of integrating category theory into the tooling pipeline.</p>
