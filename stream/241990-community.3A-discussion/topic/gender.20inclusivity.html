<p>Please, I would like to draw attention to this thread: <a href="https://github.com/HoTT/book/pull/1101">https://github.com/HoTT/book/pull/1101</a></p>
<p>I'm nervous about bringing this up here, and I won't hesitate to mod-nuke my own thread. We know from experience how difficult it is to walk the line between "things whispered behind closed doors" and "internet pile-on". The thread I linked is a HoTT space, but it is directly relevant to us category theorists because many people overlap between our communities</p>
<p>For the record, in any professional space in which I have any kind of power (which <em>mostly</em> means applied category theory in practice) I will not accept this kind of gender-nonbinary-noninclusive behaviour</p>

<p>I like Emily Riehl's take, and would prefer to avoid the pronoun minefield altogether if I am at all unsure -- and feel that tack ought to be a respected choice. Cf. the Monica Celia kerfuffle over at Stack Exchange. (I respect personal pronoun choices, but find that in extemporaneous speech I sometimes stutter or stumble when applying "their" to a specific singular person. That stuttering is unintentional and in the moment -- if a pronoun collides with my internal sense of language, then the smooth flow of speech may be interrupted. In writing it's different -- I have time to think and regroup.)  </p>
<p>Many of us (especially the older among us) may be on a learning curve. People might unintentionally offend on occasion, so I hope the approach that mods take is one of kindness and understanding. The tone of "I will not accept" is a little worrisome to me: it doesn't sound like one of giving benefit of the doubt. Intentionality matters a great deal here. </p>
<p>Maybe here in <em>this</em> zulip we can go easy on this thumbs down business. Ugh, social media.</p>

<p>I understand that it could feel awkward to use 'they' to refer to someone who you already think of as male or female, but this case was about the sentence '... let us describe how a mathematician reading the above English proof might simultaneously construct, in their head, an element of ...'. In this case we're just talking about an arbitrary mathematician, not someone of known gender.</p>

<p>Oscar, I agree: it's different. I still prefer Emily's workaround. </p>
<p>My stumbling over "they" when speaking in the moment is not a matter of sex or gender, it's the number.</p>

<p>As for the grammar of singular 'they', I have had the rare experience of actually convincing the other side in internet arguments about this topic. The trick is to simply scroll back through the posting history of anyone who objects to using 'they' as a singular, and find an example of them using it themselves. I note that Ellie Hermaszewska already performed this trick for Mike Shulman, and it's also not hard to find an example for Dan Grayson who was the other objector. I suggest anyone else who objects to it first checks their own post history!</p>

<p>And whether people have been using singular "they" for centuries wasn't really my point either. I too can do it and have done it. Whether it invariably feels like the choice I would make if it were up to me -- an entirely different matter. As I say, on some such occasions, I may jump ship altogether and choose a workaround.</p>

<p>The singular 'they' is perfectly comprehensible in modern (and not so modern) English and doesn't require convoluted passive-construction workarounds. We have reclaimed a third-person singular gender neutral pronoun and should employ that rather than the clunky 'his or her'.</p>

<p>Already considering to nuke this thread. To be clear, this is not <em>really</em> about grammar. Making mistakes is totally fine, nobody is going to get in trouble for making mistakes, using "they" to refer to individuals in speech is very jarring at first! I still get it wrong and then correct myself when I catch myself, which is not always. The bad behaviour is not making mistakes, it's <em>doubling down</em> on them</p>

<p>I, too, have difficulty using "they" in the singular, but it's a challenge I choose to embrace! I imagine Shakespeare would have just as much grammatical trouble using "you" in the singular. </p>
<p>Language evolves. We can choose to fight it, or to embrace it. I would prefer to speak a language with no grammatical gender at all. (Or at least a language where grammatical gender doesn't correlate with complex concepts like social gender or biological sex). This particular evolution of pronouns seems like the next best alternative. Grammatical discomfort seems a small price to pay to change our language for the better.</p>

<p>Well <a href="https://wals.info/feature/31A#2/26.7/149.1">the majority of languages</a> don't have gender so this isn't too surprising. Though, I think Wolof actually does have gender, it's just not masculine/feminine. (I checked because I was surprised to hear about an Atlantic-Congo language that did not have gender, since they are famous for usually having very many.) I don't know how robust the gender/noun class system in Wolof is, but then again, gender in English is marginal too, occurring only in pronouns. Quechuan languages do have evidentiality and lack gender though. (Though perhaps all of this is straying too far from the original topic...)</p>

I don't know how robust the gender/noun class system in Wolof is, but then again, gender in English is marginal too, occurring only in pronouns. Quechuan languages do have evidentiality and lack gender though. (Though perhaps all of this is straying too far from the original topic...)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah, ok -- I was just reporting what I was told by a Wolof-speaking friend. It seems quite plausible that the language "has gender" by standard linguistic classification but it's just so different from gender in e.g. French that he considers them to be not analogous things.</p>

<p>Sorry for the linguistic sidetracks.</p>
<p>If this thread is meant to be not a discussion but rather a policy statement, then it makes sense to be 200% explicit -- more explicit than a link to a long internet discussion followed by "I will not accept this kind of gender-nonbinary-noninclusive behaviour". The unfortunate fact is that not everybody is on the same page on this issue. So I see 3 options:</p>
<ol>
<li>The messy, painful process of getting people on some common page happens through discussion.</li>
<li>A clear policy is stated, which is intelligible to people who are not on the same page.</li>
<li>Some policy is enforced in an arbitrary manner.</li>
</ol>
<p>My preference is (1). I would object to (3).</p>

<p>It sounds like you're referring to the discussion over at the HoTT zulip, which as I understood it was about the writing of a book involving more than a few authors. That writing is none of the business of this zulip, although people here may hold some strong opinions about what they are discussing. </p>
<p>To get one thing out of the way: obviously we're <em>all</em> human beings. As a human being, as a <em>general rule</em> I don't want to be told how I should write. I for one wouldn't be an asshole and "double down" on calling person P "him" if P wants to be called "they". But if we're talking about a person in the abstract, then maybe it would go against my grain, as a human being, to feel compelled to use singular "they" at times when I'd rather not. (Leaving aside how I, Todd Trimble, actually feel about this -- this is only an example. In other words, I'm using "I" in a peculiar way.) How people write is a very personal thing and can be something deeply felt. </p>
<p>Since actually "in any professional space in which I have any kind of power (which mostly means applied category theory in practice) I will not accept this kind of gender-nonbinary-noninclusive behaviour" does carry more than a whiff of laying down the law -- especially since the notion of <em>power</em> was invoked, I for one would want to get clear on what, then, is considered acceptable to powers that be. The aforementioned episode of Monica Cellio shows what can happen: she was asking whether use of pronouns is <em>compulsory</em> in situations where such use could be avoided (as is virtually always the case, for competent writers). For example, she noted that there may be situations, involving human beings whose first language is not English and who are not immersed in debates involving political correctness, where use of an ostensibly plural form could be genuinely confusing or unclear. And for making inquiries into what the newly emerging Stack Exchange policy was, precisely, she wound up being stripped of her position, and with damage to her reputation. The episode was quite hideous. </p>
<p>Casting the discussion in terms of "grammatical correctness [being] more important than who somebody is as a human being" is putting it pretty tendentiously and in black-and-white terms, in my opinion. There are some nuances here. </p>
<p>By the way, as a moderator myself (over at MathOverflow), I know it's not always an easy job -- and I've had accusations of being "PC police" flung in my direction <em>plenty</em> over the years. It's super-hard threading the needle, sometimes. I hope you don't mind weathering the storm <em>too</em> much.</p>

<p>For what it's worth, I really like the use of "they". I have to stop myself from using "they" to refer to someone who prefers "she" or "he". I find it cleaner and more accurate to conceptualize gender as a one-dimensional interval than a collection of two points labelled "he" and "she" (although this interval model is far from perfect, and one could also argue that "he" and "she" could also be conceptualized differently). However, in this interval model for gender, it is then tricky to concisely refer to a point (or subinterval) on this interval in a concise and convenient way. The potentially lower degree of gender-specificity in "they" strikes me as a reasonable way to indicate the usage of this 1D model for gender. I'd prefer using "their" to "he or she" for a similar reason - in my mental model for gender "he or she" refers to a collection of two points, while "their" refers again to the use of a 1D object for modelling gender.<br>
Hopefully these thoughts are roughly on topic!</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>@**Jules Hedges**  I&#39;m not sure what you mean by &quot;this kind of gender-nonbinary-noninclusive behaviour&quot;.  We&#39;re trying to work out something sensitive in a public discussion, and that involves some back and forth, misunderstandings, flaring tempers, accusations (and worse).  But please don&#39;t unfairly, and blanketly, accuse the people having the discussion in good faith of something unjustified that could stick to them.
</code></pre></div>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276770">@Steve Awodey</span> I think what Jules is referring to as 'gender-nonbinary-noninclusive behaviour' is for example when Mike Shulman explicitly says that people describing themselves as 'transgender, non-binary, etc' sometimes behave in ways that make him 'uncomfortable'. In this case, I think the 'accusation' of being exclusionary is a fairly accurate representation of the situation and Mike Shulman's actions.</p>
<p>I think you make a great point about the necessity to avoid unfair blanket accusations. For example, I would argue that it was an unfair blanket accusation when Mike Shulman claimed that  "there is a movement to replace the fact of biological sex with a socially constructed non-binary notion of gender", a claim that had nothing to do with the PR in question, but served to blanket-paint people Mike disagrees with as ideologically driven. </p>
<p>Since you are actively involved in the discussions both here and on github, is it fair that you're chastising Jules for stating a concrete, verifiable claim, while mentioning nothing to Mike for whom your comment is far more appropriate?</p>

<p>You'll notice that one thing notably absent from this discussion is somebody who steps forward and explicitly says "here is my take on the matter, as a person who is frequently misgendered".

<p>Indeed, and I don't deny it. But in my opinion many of the policies discussed to foster inclusivity are skewed towards one end of the political spectrum. I'm not saying this is inherently wrong. I'm saying that a natural consequence of this is that it alienates people, often preventing the possibility of fruitful discussion from the start. For instance, the argument of pronouns as of now is not limited to gender issues. Supporting/not supporting pronoun enforcement has often become an identifier for a given political stance. This is negative, as it creates a distorted logic where people in favor of some ideas may end up openly not supporting them, as they are felt as 'expression of a more general political posture I do not support'. <br>
I think this gives rise also to more radicalization, on both ends of the political spectrum.</p>

 it applies without problems here and everywhere where he or she/ him or her is needed. But I am not one of the 30+ authors of the book, so I can only applaud Martin and Andrej for discussing the proposal, which I endorse.</p>

<p>Even if one is convinced Caramello is getting a lot of mileage out of something small, this is not the way to approach it. We should celebrate fresh approaches, alternative proofs, clearer conceptual pictures.

<p>What happened here was very ugly, but in all fairness Johnstone skipped that slide completely in the live presentation. I am not saying that he is excusable - he is not.

<p>Problem is I don't know what anybody can do. PJ is a Cambridge professor close to retirement, so he can in practice do virtually anything he wants to. More generally in academic nobody really "allows" anybody to do anything. (There's the nuclear option that conference organisers can "deplatform" a researcher from giving a research talk, which is something I suspect the vast majority would be <em>extremely</em> uncomfortable with.) It seems to me the best (or least-worst) thing we can do is just to talk about it publicly to make it clear what the rest of us think</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276438">@Fabrizio Genovese</span> no, what I gave was a slide that was discussed in full (I know the one you mean—and it wasn't left out of the written version of the talk). It was a 10-15 minute takedown of Caramello, I could have picked any one of several slides.</p>
<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275901">@Jules Hedges</span> the public silence about this by the organisers was a choice. I hadn't heard even a rumour about the talk until I saw it myself, months later. Another conference might have released even a non-targeted statement about the expectations about behavioural standards by participants, in particular towards marginalised people. It's not deplatforming, but making it clear to the community such a thing is a highly unprofessional act and not welcome. Maybe senior category theorists had a quiet word in private. But that does not help eg women ECRs or students reconsidering their career choices.</p>
<p>On a personal note, I was on the receiving end of a similar thing on a smaller scale from Bénabou, in public emails IIRC. I had a job outside academia, with no plans to return, so I could shrug it off to some extent. It still wasn't pleasant. People knew he was prone to such things, but I'd hate to think how it would affect someone aiming for a career in ct research.</p>

<p>Oh, I must have confused myself with the other one then, sorry.<br>
In any case, first generation category theorists seem to be rather infamous when it comes to treating people harshly, if not discriminating them outright. I think this is one of the reason why the ACT community was started as an independent endeavor: The tabula rasa approach allowed us to implement better policies, and to my knowledge the situation in ACT is orders of magnitude better when we compare it to the many unhappy circumstances that happened in traditional CT</p>

<p>So no, talking about it is not the only thing we can do. Moreover, deplatforming is not really going to work in my opinion. Also I'm conceptually kind of opposed to it as I fear the consequences it could have on freedom of expression when it is applied blindly. What we can really do - and we are doing that - is starting new communities/research fields as independent, setting a very clear policy from the start. At that point, whoever wants to join said communities will know which behaviors are tolerated and which ones are not. Clearly it could happen that we have incidents or unpleasant situations, and it will happen that we will need to rediscuss our code of conduct from time to time. Yet, these discussions will be framed in a much clearer framework, and imho this helps a lot.</p>

<p>I would not go so far as Tim, because I suspect that the situation with Caramello might be much more complicated than it's being portrayed. In particular, some very serious allegations were made by her against Martin Hyland, who has unquestionably done the community a great deal of good. I don't know what to think, but here I'd withhold judgment. </p>
<p>I agree that the CT20--&gt;21 talk was indecorous to say the least and PTJ shouldn't have aired this stuff, but I'm sure he's felt very maligned by Caramello, in a situation which had been going on for years before then. </p>
<p>Mathematically, even if we assume Caramello was rediscovering stuff known to the cognoscenti, she's doing a great deal of good bringing attention to the conceptual power of topos theory to a wider world.</p>

<p>The real problem with this is that one can be at the same time a great researcher and an awful human being. There are countless examples of this, starting with Newton if not before. Having taken note of this unhappy fact of life, I guess what one can do is setting guidelines so that awful person X has to behave nicely when working in direct contact with our community. I feel that complete deplatforming may end up hurting the community way more than it hurts the person.</p>

<p>To what Fabrizio said (and I mostly agree with the spirit), I would add that "awful person" is such a blanketing term. We can agree that some people sometimes do things we consider awful, but in other instances, they do a great deal of good. </p>
<p>I would also say that people can change and evolve. In the US we have countless stories of people who believe that gay people are wicked, or who "choose" to be gay as a lifestyle choice [against what God intended, etc., etc.] -- until their son announces (with great trepidation) that he is gay, and then some hard internal questioning and searching may take place and the parent eventually turns around. Doesn't always happen, obviously, but it certainly can. I've seen it happen with people close to me. </p>
<p>Deplatforming (which would be sort of like punishing) is not the way to go, in my opinion. Open conversation, including with the person we think is behaving badly, is much much better. </p>
<p>All this being said -- and in case it wasn't clear, based on things I said earlier -- I take strong exception to some things Mike Shulman said in the other forum, and I feel badly about pain that was undoubtedly occasioned by his words. I also know him to be on many occasions a kind and gentle person, on top of being an excellent mathematician.</p>

<p>I don't think that is the right comparison to make. Deplatforming is warranted when it causes less harm to the community than the harm done by "awful person X" to the community (it is in no way meant to hurt that person, although it inevitably does). This assessment is very hard to make and I don't want to comment precisely on the concrete situations discussed above, but in general, I value the quality of the research environment above all of the scientific production in the world. Thus, I am against making a huge effort (as a community, I don't mind if individuals want to make that effort) to keep someone in line no matter their position in the community.</p>

<p>Todd, I mean no disrespect, but I am puzzled by the structure of this sentence. Is your argument that <em>because</em> Martin Hyland has unquestionably done the community a great deal of good, <em>then</em> the very serious accusations by Caramello are not worth listening to? Or that it was wrong for Caramello to make serious accusations against someone who has done the community a great deal of good?</p>
<p>And if the allegations are so serious that we should hold our judgement in whether PTJ is justified in publicly bullying her, then shouldn't we hear them before making up our mind, rather than discuss them with vague allusions?</p>
<p>I am also very uncomfortable to hear that PTJ was criticising Caramello's <em>work</em> as a proxy of airing his personal grievances with her. I hope people can see the problem with this kind of intellectual dishonesty, and how bad it would be if it became standard practice within an academic community?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277611">@Todd Trimble</span> I do not mean to single you out in the above, I am sure that you've meant your comment with the best intentions. I just strongly believe that it does not help anyone if serious allegations get relegated to private channels and we never hear of them. This was the case with how academia worked in the past, and I believe that it's important to change that. </p>
<p>If it wasn't for the HoTT github thread, I at least would have never known that Mike Shulman has a trans grad student, and that his beliefs have caused a friction between them. And I think it's important to ask ourselves, as a community, how we will respond if as a result of this friction she will leave the field? I can only speak for myself, but if I was in her situation, that's what I would be seriously thinking of.</p>
<p>Would people here really be okay with sweeping the whole situation under the rug, and only referring to the incident in the vaguest of terms as some "serious allegations against Mike Shulman, who has unquestionably done a great deal for this community and the advancement of categorical logic"?</p>

<p>Zanzi, I'm not making that argument. Here I'm suspending judgment: it's possible that Hyland did the things she said, on general grounds that people do bad things on occasion. At the same time, it's a bit of she said/he said [nothing], and I'm having trouble balancing her allegation against the idea I've formed of the man, whom I know a little, and who has been a champion of young women starting careers in mathematics and has supported them greatly. I suspect we might not be getting the whole story, but I'm trying to keep an open mind. </p>
<p>I'm not sure what you mean by private channels. We're talking openly here, aren't we? If you feel I'm speaking obliquely, it's because I'm not sure whether I should mention a student by name who is associated with Mike and who is trans. Maybe it'd be okay, or maybe she wouldn't like to be discussed by strangers. I'm not good with these things.</p>

<p>Yes, thank you, that's what I was asking about! I will have a look, but it looks like a lot of writing to be honest. It'd help to narrow down which specific allegations are the ones that seem the most questionable, but I'll admit that maybe it's best if I focus on one issue at a time. I only brought up Olivia because her and Astra's situation seemed similar on the surface, since both Mike and Martin are well-established community members who have made great contributions to the field.</p>

<p>I assume it's fine to use Astra's name and refer to the public information that she shared, since she did choose to come forward with it. And I do feel that it's important to discuss this, given that we're talking about gender inclusivity and why some women leave the field, and here is an actual woman with a tangible risk of leaving the field.</p>

<p>I was looking forward to them too. Mike will have surely have an opportunity to talk about this research at a more appropriate time.</p>

<p>Yes, it would have been a great talk. It's unfortunate that Mike chose to go on this transphobic rant right before the seminar series. In the future I hope he will be  a bit more considerate to those of us who think he's a great mathematician and airdrop any further bigoted opinions when he doesn't have any speaking engagements.</p>

<p>I think Thorsten's comments miss the point. As multiple people in this thread have pointed out, all of us here have wildly different opinions, yet all of us are capable of maintaining a social filter in order to keep up professional decorum. I think that's just the reality of existing on the internet.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, If Mike Shulman's political opinions are so extreme that he loses any awareness of professional boundaries, and these opinions start influencing his decisions in his professional life, such as whether to accept an edit to a book or how he behaves towards his own grad student, then it's pretty clear that he's a liability as a speaker, and I don't blame the seminar organisers for not wanting him to speak at this moment.</p>

<p>I think the absolute worst way would be to double down and start picking fights with even more people. And I say this from experience, as I actually ended up in an argument with someone the year you left twitter, because that person kept accusing the students (who were upset with your joke) of being stasis, and when I - to the best of my ability - suggested a more diplomatic approach, I got called a stasi as well. So, erm, I strongly advise not doing <em>that</em>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as it turns out, Mike Shulman finds me personally 'uncomfortable' by virtue of me being trans. So I will pass on offering any concrete advice on this occasion. But the offer is valid to any of my friends here who are to the right of centre - if you ever feel worried about being "cancelled", I will happily offer any support that I can.</p>

<p>Time will tell, but I wouldn't predict this - presumably the field isn't run by a shadowy left-wing cabal but rather, as usual, individual event organisers will use their individual judgement. There's the question of whether there'll be a "firestorm of complaint" and, if so, whether most event organisers will give into it. Time will tell, but I'll predict not</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure that in this case nothing would have happened.

<p>Trial-by-mob is funny, because everything turns into a big deal until it is not anymore. People just forget and go on with their life. The internet mob is basically a chaotic swarm of locusts that almost never remembers and almost never looks back. ...Which makes any cry for justice in the internet sphere even more paradoxical in my opinion.

<p>Basically, to me everything looks like a short term goal in the age of social internet. Either you obtain results immediately or you don't, as you will gradually lose the interest of the crowd. It's literally like protests. If prices go up and people swarm the streets and break stuff long enough, maybe the government will do something to calm everyone down. If people go home before the government acts, most likely the government won't. The internet is like this, but on steroids. ...Which basically flattens any possible debate about everything to its immediate consequences. But when it comes to complicated issues this turns very quickly into a curse. <span aria-label="confused" class="emoji emoji-1f615" role="img" title="confused">:confused:</span></p>

<p>Nevertheless it comes back in the end to this kind of thing. Obviously I don't expect everyone to have the "right political opinions", that way lies madness. Believing in democracy means believing that it is a good thing that there are people who disagree with you. However I <em>do</em> expect everyone to treat everyone else a certain way. Nobody's political beliefs give them the right to do certain things, and intentionally mis-gendering people is one of those.</p>

<p>I agree, and you are rising a good point: There is a great difference between what people think and their behavior. As I said, on some issues I identify as conservative and my opinion would be pretty much orthogonal to the opinions of many people here and in academia in general. Still, I do not think my opinions allow or justify me to behave inappropriately in a given context. I always strive to treat people as kindly as I possibly can and I really do my best to make everyone feel welcome. Yet, I have to ask: Is this enough? To me, it feels like the issue here is not necessarily behavioral. I've seen countless tweets and topics everywhere that could be summarized as "you are not allowed to have a given opinion". This feels very different from "you are not allowed to behave in a way that makes other people feel excluded", which I believe is what code of conducts try to fix. In a nutshell, living in the age of internet for a conservative person feels like a constant "reductio ad Hitlerum" where everything you say can be considered as arbitrarily close to fascism. The way you behave feels totally marginal. I do not think this is right for two reasons: First, it is a gross approximation of a person's beliefs. Second, the way you behave with other people doesn't seem to matter. What matters is if the opinions you have are deemed acceptable or not by the majority of the internet crowd. Personally, I find  the idea of living in a world like this repulsive.</p>

<p>Man, my calculus course of notes were literally decorated with hammers and sickles all over. It was the same in my high school and the same in my middle school. I cannot say anything about my elementary school, probably I was too little to notice any element of communist indoctrination back then. When I look around I don't think it's much better now. Maybe I've grown up with the wrong expectations at this point -- that is, if I enrolled in a Math degree I don't see why I should be exposed to citations by Mao and Marx, which is what literally happened to me. Point is, I didn't say anything, I just thought "Ok, evidently the universe is perma-fucked" and I kept going with my life. But yes, since we are bringing this stuff up I'd like to remind everyone that this stuff happened, it keeps happening, and it is somehow the norm in the Italian education system.</p>

<p>The conversation started with Jules saying he will not accept any kind of gender-nonbinary-noninclusive behavior in this space, which I guess everyone here agrees with. What we do not necessarily agree upon is the definition of behavior. If that wasn't the case, everyone would have said "cool" and there would be no conversation at all. Instead we are having a conversation, that it is very clearly steering towards the broader question of "how should we behave in these situations? And  what kind of behavior should warrant a reaction from the community"? I think, then, that me asking "are my behaviors and my political ideas considered to be synonyms?" is a pretty damn good question to ask.</p>
<p>...About examples, with names and surnames, I have plenty. As I already repeated, for very obvious reason, I am absolutely not willing to go into such details in this venue.</p>

<p>Yes, exactly. I don't want people to think that I'm picking on conservatives specifically, there are some far-left people in the field who I'm just as uncomfortable with as with the transphobes. I'm an Eastern European, so when I see self-proclaimed Stalinists or Leninists, I can't tell you how offensive I find that. Especially given what Russia is doing to Ukraine right now.</p>
<p>But while those people are pretty active on Twitter, they don't bring their politics into PR requests of projects that I follow.  And if people as extreme as that are somehow able to filter themselves and maintain professional decorum, I don't see what the problem is with the rest of us having a bit of a filter too, when our beliefs are much mode moderate.</p>

<p>If it becomes - as it is - a topic about present and future code of conduct drafting then everyone's grievances are pretty much on topic.</p>

<p>Please, if you view this thread as a forum to air your own grievances about codes of conduct, I beg you to be more specific about what these grievances are. I find it counterproductive to assert that one has grievances, but to refuse to specify what those grievances are. In particular, I find it insufficiently specific to say "many codes of conduct are skewed against me" without specifying <em>in what way</em> they are skewed against you. At this point, I feel that your unspecified grievances are a distraction from the matter at hand.</p>

<p>I'll admit that I've lost my level-headedness. </p>
<p>Fab and I have a history of arguing on other social networks, and his last message to me was very explicit in stating that he doesn't want to interact with me again (along with calling me a host of other expletives). So while I wasn't bothered when me and him were addressing each other's points indirectly, I was very taken aback when he started tagging me over and over, to the point of having to mute him. </p>

<p>I'll say one last thing before I go, as I feel it's important to explain why I still feel so strongly about this issue, and why I don't believe that these embers are dying out any time soon. </p>
<p>We've talked about the distinction between disagreeing with someone's actions versus disagreeing with their opinions, and this situation is actually a pretty good case study on this. You might remember that there were two HoTT authors with similarly bigoted opinions in the original github PR. But only one of them has been actively discussed after the PR closed down. </p>
<p>I don't know if anyone here has seen Dan Grayson's twitter account before, but I tried to scroll down his timeline for over a year in order to find a single math tweet, and I couldn't. It was non-stop anti-trans rhetoric. And I'm not saying this to attack Dan, but instead to point out that if people really cared about opinions so much, then why isn't Dan getting as much backlash as Mike? </p>
<p>As far as I can see, it's because Dan's opinions begin and end with his twitter feed. So they really are opinions, not actions. And the only time when his opinions spilled over into his professional life was when he made those comments on the PR, and we've seen how that went. </p>
<p>And when this incident began it really seemed like Mike was in the same boat, just another academic with some unsavoury opinions. But as the thread progressed, it came out that he actually has a trans grad student, and the fact that she is trans has been a source of majour ongoing conflict between them. And that really re-contextualises everything that Mike said in that thread, whether it was about trans people making him uncomfortable, or Mike not wanting to change his language for people with 'abnormalities'.</p>
<p>I myself did not know about Mike's grad student before her post, but it turned out that I have a few acquaintances in common with her (it's a small field after all). And it's not my place to share anything, but I get the impression that the situation is quite ugly, and there's a possibility that it might not be over any time soon. </p>
<p>So the reason why people are still so angry with Mike, and have largely forgotten Dan, is that Mike is actually acting on his opinions in a way that is harmful to a person he has authority over. And the people angry with Mike aren't some faceless Twitter mob, but actual people in our field, mostly grad students. </p>
<p>Personally, I am not trying to 'cancel' Mike, and I look forward to both him returning as a speaker when this situation gets resolved, and to reading his upcoming book. But if this situation gets worse, and his student drops out as a result of this conflict, then ... I have a strong feeling that a lot of people will not forgive Mike for his role in that. And I would agree with them, and would maintain that if this happens then Mike Shulman should not be put in charge of another PhD student ever again.</p>

<p>I have a slightly different view on that.</p>
<p>Last year we had something similar in the Brazilian Logic mailing list. One person asked how other people were dealing with gender-neutral language, that is much trickier to use in Portuguese than in English, and several people freaked out and started a transphobic rant together. I decided to attack one person in particular - a senior logician, called José Carlos Cifuentes, that apparently is very very important and very very respected in both Brazil and in the Spanish-speaking countries of Latin America... I say "apparently" because I've never read his papers. Anyway: I sent an e-mail to the mailing list in which I said that he was treating gender-neutral language as something that _had to be_ ridiculed; he was ignoring all the material that other people had shared about the discussion on gender-neutral language, that has been going on for several years, and treating it as something idiotic - and everyone who had been following these discussions could see clearly the patterns he was reproducing, his arrogance, and his blind spots... and I said that what was going to happen was that in all the future events of the community all the people in the newer generations would look at him not as a great logician but as "oh no, here's that stupid old guy again".</p>
<p>Once he was attacked in this way the other transphobes stopped.</p>
<p>I guess that many people both here and on github decided to focus on Mike by reasonings similar to the one that I had... people are discussing attitudes and behaviors that can be discussed both in abstract/generic cases and in particular cases; and in the moments in which they feel that it is better to discuss particular cases they think that it is better to discuss Mike, and treat Dan as something secondary - and as less interesting, and as a degenerate case.</p>

<p>To clarify: <em>in complete isolation</em>, both the singular and plural they phrasings are non-exclusionary; but in context it's clear that the plural version is indeed a compromise, rejecting singular they, and one that I'm sure many would feel to be giving too much ground.</p>

<p>Complaining about the singular 'they' is often a dog whistle for transphobic beliefs. I am wary of those who argue more fervently for the prescriptivist use of pronouns than the rights of trans people.</p>

<p>One point that Mike <a href="https://github.com/HoTT/book/pull/1101#issuecomment-1065924234">made</a> in the linked github discussion was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... I think when discussing a hypothethical indeterminate person it's standard to assume that person is normal in all ways that are irrelevant to the issue at hand.... It's sensible and polite to avoid unnecessarily calling attention to the disability of any particular person, but when discussing a generic indeterminate person, we wouldn't get anywhere if we had to phrase everything in ways that included all possible sorts of abnormalities that an arbitrary person might have.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reminds me of a personal experience, so it's now story time. A few years ago there was a discussion group I participated in, generally on a weekly basis. One thing we did each week was some sort of icebreaker activity. One week, the premise of the activity was that everybody sat around and made eye contact with one another for an uncomfortably long time (the consensus ended up being that this was a weird activity and nobody wanted to do it again, but that's beside the point). The issue was that one member of the discussion group -- let's call her Alice -- was visually impaired (legally blind, I believe). In the course of introducing the activity, the facilitator -- let's call him Bob -- actually acknowledged this -- at one point turning to Alice and saying "You probably won't be able to participate". But the group went ahead with the activity regardless, with Alice sitting it out. I think she ended up leaving the room, and only after a time did somebody go check on her. For most of the participants, the rest of the evening proceeded as usual. (I'm missing a few details of how exactly this went down, because I was actually absent the week this occurred, and found out about it the next week when we spent our time discussing what had happened the previous week.)</p>
<p>Alice was extremely distressed by the experience on a few counts. In an ideal world, when Bob realized the activity would exclude Alice, he would have cancelled the activity or substituted an alternative. In an ideal world, when Bob pointed out publicly that Alice wouldn't be able to participate, somebody else would have suggested that the activity be cancelled or substituted for. In an ideal world, when Alice left the room, everybody would have realized right away that she was likely upset, and would have interrupted the evening to support her. Alas, this was not an ideal world.</p>
<p>The next week, as mentioned, we spent most of the evening discussing what had happened. It was a productive discussion, but there was a disconnect. Somehow, there was still a lack of empathy for Alice's experience. Some participants continued to stress points like the fact that they didn't end up enjoying the whole activity anyway. I think this kind of missed the point (and it reminds me of my own comments <a href="#narrow/stream/241990-general.3A-values/topic/gender.20inclusivity/near/278558959">above</a> where I said that I don't like gendered pronouns anyway -- I think I missed the point there).  One point that Alice came back to a few times was that a central reason that the whole experience was so traumatizing was that she cared deeply about this community. Otherwise she might have brushed it all off, but because she was invested, it was a real gut punch to see the group not only exclude her, but then proceed to minimize her experience at every level, even as they sincerely tried to appreciate what had happened. It was not long after that I moved away and left behind this discussion group, but I think I have the impression that Alice may have ended up leaving the community altogether -- even though that was an outcome which nobody wanted.</p>
<p>I believe the central reason for this empathy gap was that Alice was classified as "abnormal". It is indeed standard in many contexts to assume that others are "normal". I believe this standard state of affairs is often problematic. It can lead to precisely this sort of empathy gap.</p>
<p>Bringing things back to the matter at hand, I think this story is pretty relevant. One thing that people participating in internet discussion forums and people writing books have in common is that they write for large audiences which can be difficult or impossible to visualize. I believe the readership of a book or an internet message board are <em>communities</em> which are relevantly analogous to the small in-person discussion group in my story. There are all sorts of people whom I might consider "abnormal" who might be part of such a community. I believe that we should strive to be inclusive of all these people in a way which is relevantly similar to the way my discussion group should have striven to include Alice.</p>

<hr>
<p><strong>So I propose the following rule of thumb as regards inclusivity of all sorts here on this zulip:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When posting here, please speak as though any member of the zulip might be in the room, observing the discussion with the possibility of joining in as a participant. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In particular, if the way you are speaking would be impolite or exclusionary in the case that you'd said it in a face-to-face setting with some member of this zulip, then that is problematic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If somebody points out that the way you are speaking doesn't meet this standard, or reasonably might not meet this standard, it's not a big deal if you acknowledge this and modify the way you are speaking. And if you need additional guidance, it's okay to ask for that too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If this happens, please try to learn from the experience, and attempt to continue to take into account this aspect of your audience here in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there's some question about inclusivity which requires you to manually go through the list of zulip members and ask "is this person of type X?" then you're doing it wrong.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this is in some sense a <em>higher</em> standard than the standards of in-person communication, because it asks you to consider a somewhat open-ended audience of which you'll never have full knowledge. Writing on the internet (like writing in a book) is not the same as in-person communication. It's harder. (But it's a skill which one can learn through practice, with friendly feedback from others).</p>

<p>Moreover, I believe that when writing <em>for</em> an audience of mathematicians, <em>about</em> an "indeterminate mathematician", implicitly I am generally inviting the reader to imagine themselves in the place of this "indeterminate mathematician". In that sense, my "indeterminate mathematician" variable should permit the substitution of any of my readers. In particular, in Mike's example it would indeed be exclusionary to assume that my reader is ambulatory! I agree it's not as easy to meet this sort of standard as it is to speak one-on-one with a particular person. But I think we can get pretty far while striving to meet this standard. (In fact, ultimately I think we will go further this way!)</p>

<p>One immediate potentially problematic case which comes to mind is the case where somebody is in the room, watching a discussion between two people, but doesn't have the technical background to follow the discussion precisely. The standard I'm proposing doesn't mean you have to explain everything you say in a way intelligible to somebody with minimal background. But it does mean that you should be aware of the possibility that somebody might ask you to fill in some technical context, just as if they were in a physical room observing your discussion and wishing to follow in more detail. Just as in this case, there will be a balance to be struck between explaining some context to certain people while perhaps assuming such context with others -- and just as in the in-person scenario, there are various solutions if there's a big gap in background between different people in the room. Among the possible solutions are that such a discussion might split into a few different discussions, etc.</p>

<p>That's a good question. Pontryagin was lucky to have a mother who dedicated herself to serving as his personal screen-reader, and worked out lots of customizations for mathematical notation that she didn't necessarily understand. I don't know what the state of affairs is today.</p>

<p>The idea behind my proposed "rule of thumb" is that some of the disconnect we see in these sorts of internet discussions comes from the abstractness of the concept of inclusivity. The idea behind my proposal is to remedy this by reducing to what I think is an easier case: the case of in-person inclusivity. For example, we might debate in the abstract notions of pronouns, but I generally observe that even people who object in principle to the use of certain pronouns will find a way to be polite, even friendly, when they are actually in the physical presence of a person whose pronouns they might refuse to use in the abstract. But maybe I'm putting too many eggs in the basket of "people are willing and able to engage in this exercise of imagining person X in front of them and thinking through how they would interact with them inclusively and with politeness".</p>

<p>Some related thoughts...Language patterns like "normal" and "abnormal" are probably not the best we can do when referring to people. If I'm one of the "abnormal" people, I'll feel at least a bit marginalized by this language. This language makes it sounds like there is a core group of people in a community, and then there are other people at the fringes in some way. If we can, I think it's much better to use language that seeks to affirm and appreciate the value of everyone involved. Actually, I think communities becomes richer when there are people with a variety of experiences! So, if it is appropriate to make note of the differences between the people present, I think it is good to strive to do this in a way that recognizes that the existence of these differences is a strength of the community, not a weakness.</p>

<p>FWIW, I think the deeper problem is that people want to be normal.  I don't want to be normal!  I remember one of the things we (I and the people I knew) figured out in high school is that Weird is Good!  Because "Weird is Good" is thoroughly ingrained in how I think, Mike referring to people's "abnormalities" didn't carry any sort of negative connotation in my idiolect, it just seemed to me that he was referring to personal characteristics that most people don't have (e.g. being non-ambulatory, since most people are not non-ambulatory).  It was only after other people discussed what the word meant for them that I realized that it was a gaffe.  I don't know whether Mike was intending the negative connotations, as this is the kind of thing which is impossible to communicate on the internet.  If he did intend them, then he was being derogatory towards people with characteristics that most people don't have.  If he didn't intend them, then he was merely being insensitive towards such people, as he should have known that to many of them "abnormalities" would have negative connotations.</p>

<p>I don't think that's a deeper problem at all. I also don't think marginalized people want to be "normal". Instead, they want to be treated with the same dignity and respect as those seen as normal; when people say they wish they could be normal it's usually expressing a desire to avoid any kind of negative social effects caused by their difference. In any case, differences or rare characteristics typically don't lead to marginalization, so a lot of context of gender inclusivity is lost if we generalize to a discussion of being weird.</p>
<p>I really do appreciate the inclusive sentiment of the last three messages, just want to be sure that social issues (in this case, transphobia) are thought of in the right context and not in some general framework where important characteristics and properties of that particular social issue are lost</p>

<p>From my perspective, different words that broadly mean "uncommon" (or "weird" if you prefer) have different connotations. A word like "abnormal" reads to me as "uncommon and probably bad" while a word like "remarkable" reads to me as "uncommon and probably good". Although, of course, the way in which a word is used in context is also important, beyond whatever connotations it may have in isolation.</p>
<p>I appreciate the refocusing that Sean suggests on the particular topic of this thread.</p>

<p>That's a nice goal to strive for, but in our world, the concept of "normality" is often used as a club for in-groups to bludgeon out-groups.   If someone is putting you down by calling you "abnormal", you can't just pretend they're complimenting you - especially if they go ahead and then physically beat you up or kill you.</p>
