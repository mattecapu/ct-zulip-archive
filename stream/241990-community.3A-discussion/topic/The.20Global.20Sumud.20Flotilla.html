<p>As I write this, over 40 civilian vessels are sailing within 200km of the coast of Gaza carrying people from dozens of different countries. They are the <a href="https://globalsumudflotilla.org/">Global Sumud Flotilla</a>, carrying humanitarian relief by sea in the hope of breaking the 18 year blockade on Gaza by Israel and open a humanitarian corridor---a route by which further aid can arrive in future.<br>
Based on their experiences in future missions, they are likely to he intercepted and kidnapped by the Israeli military. Already this morning several Israeli vessels have been sighted.</p>
<p>Israel has maintained its impunity for its previous kidnappings by smearing the activists involved. The more people are watching the events unfold, the more difficult it becomes for them to get away with that. The US and other interested western governments continue to defend and fund the genocide Israel is committing; whatever happens to this flotilla from now on, it must be leveraged against the continued support of Israel. Whatever channels you have to speak out, please use them.</p>

<p>Speaking for myself, I would prefer to be part of a community that does not throw around words like "genocide" inappropriately, which in my view is what you are doing.  If you wanted to have a <em>conversation</em> about that, then there might be an argument for putting it in community:discussion.  I would still argue that it is not the role of the category theory community to take any stand at all on political issues that have nothing to do with category theory or even with mathematics; but at least an open-minded invitation to dialogue about a controversial subject would not make category theorists feel unwelcome based on their political views.</p>
<p>However, the post that opened this thread is not an invitation to dialogue, but rather states debatable propositions as if they were established facts, and implicitly assumes that anyone reading must agree with the author.  This is not taking "What do we stand for?" as a discussion question, but rather presuming to answer it not only for yourself but for the whole community.  That is what does damage to the community, by alienating anyone who disagrees with it, especially when it is posted by an otherwise highly respected community member.  (And I think it would still be harmful in meta:off-topic, just less harmful.)  Even a simple qualifier at the start like "if you believe X, then ..." could go a long way towards maintaining more inclusivity of the community when posting something like this.</p>

<p>This kind of response is not very helpful either.  A world where every reasonable person had the time and emotional and other resources to be involved in every important cause would unfortunately be a far kinder and healthier world than the one we actually live in.  And anyway, trying to cast shame on people for not participating is only a good recruitment tool if your words are finely tuned enough to actually make them <em>feel</em> shame, and I've seen no sign of anything in the last thread or this one that shows you're able to be that convincing.</p>

<p>I think you're very wrong on the facts here, but it is the case that a lot of propaganda has been flying around (from both sides of the issue) and hence it's presumptuous for anyone to come at the issue as if anyone who's not on their side on it is personally stupid, gullible or evil.</p>
<p>I'd be much happier if this thread were focused on updates on the flotilla and accompanying actions rather than being sidetracked into debates about whether there is a Palestinian genocide or to what degree the mathematical community <em>as a collective</em> should be involved in issues like genocide versus pursuing such issues as individuals or members of our other intersecting communities.  There's a place for such debates, but we have topics for a reason.</p>

<p>I can get behind that. Thanks for the input <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="438995">@James Deikun</span>, you're right that reacting to Mike as I did won't get us very far.</p>
<p>After the interception above, there was significant reaction in the form of gatherings in Paris and a number of cities in Italy in spite of the late hour. According to the satellite tracker several of the boats made it through the Israeli blockade; it seems that the main priority for the interception was to detain the activists who have been drawing the most media attention (esp. journalists) to reduce the chance of live coverage continuing when they land.</p>

<p>By now, all of the boats in the flotilla have been intercepted. That means hundreds of peaceful activists illegally detained. The fact that they got so close to Gaza makes this all the more frustrating. </p>
<p>If you want to send a message to your local representative(s), but are unsure what exactly to say, <a href="https://globalsumudflotilla.org/sos/">this page</a> has videos from all of the participants explaining who they are, that they have been illegally detained and asking for their immediate release. If you participate in any protests, given that police violence is becoming more and more prevalent, it's a good idea to make contact in advance with others that are participating so that you know you'll not be alone.</p>

<p>I posted about it because I was just searching for updates yesterday and was quite shocked to see this ahead of the results!</p>

<p>James pointed out a few days ago that a lot of propaganda has been flying around. A major reason that propaganda from Israel has had such a large influence is that it tends to be parroted without adequate scrutiny by legacy media outlets. Here is a <a href="https://pca.st/episode/0a0d3785-3593-4577-8b78-aa6f34fee934">podcast episode</a> examining the UK media coverage of the Sumud Flotilla in particular, featuring a journalist (Mathilda Mallinson) who was on board one of the ships until an engine failure meant that she could no longer adequately report on the mission in situ.</p>

<p>Just to clarify, my thumb-up to James' first comment was indeed intended to apply to both its prongs. I find it quite distasteful for a moderator of this forum to unilaterally refuse a change of channel which seems to me self-evidently correct (if this is on-topic, nothing is off-topic; I do not believe you will find any other thread in this channel with no exoteric connection to category theory).</p>

<p>The description of this channel does say "politics permitted". Doesn't this fit that description?</p>

<p>Did people ask for "Returning a medal, freeing a people" to be moved to off-topic? I don't remember, but it seems similar.</p>

<p>I think there's an essential difference, in that "Returning a medal, freeing a people" was specifically about actions taken by mathematicians, in their capacity as mathematicians, in protest of a policy adopted by an organization that is an organ of the mathematical community.  This topic, meanwhile, doesn't seem to have more connection to the mathematical community than to any other community, professional or otherwise.</p>
<p>Thus, while I'm personally glad to see this topic on the Zulip, I think it belongs in off-topic.</p>

<p>Thanks, Joe. I hadn't widened my window enough to see that. I wasn't here when the descriptions were written, but I would want to read "politics permitted" to have an implicit "...insofar as certain discussions about what we stand for, as the CT community, what we like, and what we shall do, intersect with politics." For this to be on-topic, it seems that we would have to be (1) agreeing <em>as a community</em> that Israel is currently committing a genocide, or war crimes, or whatever is the minimal proposition on which Morgan's entreaty relies and (2) discussing what we want to do <em>as a community</em> against these crime. Even if you were to take the overbold assumption that the community is in consensus around (1), this post has no relation to (2), since it is merely a call for us to individually take actions that any citizen might take. I suggest in summary that promotion of political actions by members of this community <em>qua</em> general citizens, as opposed to CT community members, cannot in fact be on-topic here.</p>

<p>Ideally, besides the topic itself being in <a class="stream" data-stream-id="229451" href="/#narrow/channel/229451-meta.3A-off-topic">#meta: off-topic</a> , the discussion of whether it belongs in <a class="stream" data-stream-id="229451" href="/#narrow/channel/229451-meta.3A-off-topic">#meta: off-topic</a> or <a class="stream" data-stream-id="241990" href="/#narrow/channel/241990-community.3A-discussion">#community: discussion</a> should go in <a class="stream" data-stream-id="229122" href="/#narrow/channel/229122-meta.3A-meta">#meta: meta</a> as it's now grown as large as the substantive content of the thread, but unfortunately it feels like there are too many messages that touch on both substantive and meta content to cut it cleanly.</p>

<p>It's a fair point. Although I don't agree that we should agree as a community on something before discussing next steps. That's a recipe for doing nothing ever. </p>
<p>I think chopping up this discussion might be more work than it's worth.</p>

<p>Thanks for the input, Kevin and James, but there has at no point been a particular rule that a topic in this channel is required to satisfy any particular constraints of the kind you're suggesting. I started this topic because I know from private (online and in person) conversations that many people in this community think what's happening in Gaza and the efforts to stop it should be <em>discussed</em>. Unfortunately any good faith engagement has been stalled by the repeated critique of choice of channel. Ironically Mike's opinion has resulted in a <em>discussion</em> in #off-topic (the moderator policy clearly says that constructive political discussion will be moved to #community:discussion)...</p>

<p>What/where is the moderator policy? In any case, I see nothing stopping anyone from ignoring the meta discussion and responding to your original comments. But no one really has, and I really fail to see how they’re the kind of comments that could open a <em>discussion</em>.</p>
