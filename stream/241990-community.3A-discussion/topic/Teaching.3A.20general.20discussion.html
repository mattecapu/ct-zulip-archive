<p>Now, if me, a total no one with barely a "real" CT experience can teach CT to random people without a mathematics background, I am 100% sure that everyone else can. And, most importantly, I am 100% sure that everyone else can learn.</p>

<p>I know some mathematicians that can only present things in the style "definition/theorem/proof" - and I like to believe that they are mostly unable to teach things to random people without a background in mathematics...</p>
<p>Some people develop intuition about mathematical objects by playing with concrete examples and by doing calculations and tests - and there are people who think that intution coming from particular cases is practically useless, and that you should work only by learning theorems and by trying to prove new theorems... also, some people think very visually, while others less so.</p>
<p>If you are able to teach CT to random people that probably means that you can deal well with different ways of thinking. <span aria-label="slight smile" class="emoji emoji-1f642" role="img" title="slight smile">:slight_smile:</span></p>

<p>In academia, at least in the institutions I've been in, teaching is considered secondary to research. I know people who routinely negotiate to reduce their teaching workload so they can focus on their research. Tenure is ostensibly granted on the basis of research, teaching and service, but the balance is heavily tilted in favour of research. In fact, people have often viewed getting a teaching award as a kiss of death, career-wise.</p>

<p>This is true. But still... I did some TAing during my PhD in Oxford, mainly to get some money. I hated that. Still, hating it was no good reason to not to try to do it as best as I could. The way I saw it, they were paying me for a service, and it was my responsibility to give the best service I could. The fact that I did not like it was marginal</p>

<p>On the other hand, I think it's entirely understandable that some people do not wish to teach. Teaching is a different skill set to researching, and it appears to me that the reason they are conflated in academic roles so frequently is partially historical and partially practical. If you don't enjoy teaching and are not very good at it, but are an accomplished researcher, there seems no reason you should be forced to teach. Some people (e.g. Feynman) may have found teaching useful, but that's not to say everyone would benefit in the same way.</p>

<p>As a student, one can tell who enjoys teaching, and they are generally the better teachers. Forcing those who do not enjoy teaching into it is of limited benefit to anyone.</p>

<p>I definitely agree that one should not be able to lecture without some degree of formal training. It's arguable whether that should happen at the graduate level or later; it'd probably be helpful to have training for smaller-scale teaching (e.g. talks/seminars/reading groups/teaching assistants) at the graduate level, and full teaching for any academics that go on to do lecturing. I think lecturing is a skill that many academics are expected to employ, but is separate from smaller-scale teaching, and not necessary for graduate students to learn.</p>

<p>I think presenting a talk and giving a lecture are significantly different, due to the technical ability of the audience (and the gap in knowledge between the presenter and the audience) as well as the opportunity in a lecture to teach for an extended period of time.</p>

<p>"I was in the cafeteria and some guy, fooling around, throws a plate in the air. As the plate went up in the air I saw it wobble, and I noticed the red medallion of Cornell on the plate going around. It was pretty obvious to me that the medallion went around faster than the wobbling. I had nothing to do, so I start figuring out the motion of the rotating plate. I discovered that when the angle is very slight, the medallion rotates twice as fast as the wobble rate—two to one. It came out of a complicated equation! I went on to work out equations for wobbles. Then I thought about how the electron orbits start to move in relativity. Then there's the Dirac equation in electrodynamics. And then quantum electrodynamics. And before I knew it… the whole business that I got the Nobel prize for came from that piddling around with the wobbling plate."</p>

<p>chiming in to add to the pile of people saying that teaching helps them learn</p>

<p>pretty sure half the things i know clicked for me when i was forced to piece them together coherently because i was trying to explain them to someone</p>

<p>The significance of teaching was brought into figural salience for all to see by <a href="https://conceptualmathematics.wordpress.com/2023/09/21/education-and-research/">Professor F. William Lawvere</a>.  In this context, it may be relevant to consider <a href="https://playinmath.wordpress.com/2022/12/04/grassmanns-theory-of-pedagogy/">Grassmann’s theory of pedagogy</a>, along with the role of <a href="https://conceptualmathematics.wordpress.com/2024/10/28/explicit-foundational-concepts-in-the-teaching-of-mathematics/">foundational concepts</a> and the not quite a happy <a href="https://playinmath.wordpress.com/2023/02/08/history-and-philosophy-of-mathematic-reform/">history of MathEd</a>.</p>
<p>I think of <a href="https://conceptualmathematics.medium.com/teaching-8a5b00bcc3a9">teaching as learning-with-students</a>.  After every lecture / course, I ask: how did my understanding of the subject <a href="https://philpeople.org/feed_items/375015442">change</a> as <a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/POSTSP-2">a result of teaching the same subject yet again</a>; <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/9u7sx">did I learn anything</a> more?  I write <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/7792145">term papers</a> along with the students; they evaluate mine as I evaluate (rewrite) theirs.<br>
(my 5mBTC ;)</p>
<p>P.S. I thought of adding something closer to our home turf: a number, say 1969, can be thought of as a function with places and values as domain and codomain sets, respectively.  Functions, in turn, can be thought of as a subcategory of graphs (target = source).  With numbers as loops, we have an interesting situation from the Lawvere &amp; Schanuel <a href="https://conceptualmathematics.substack.com/p/mathematicians-mathematician">Objective Number Theory</a> with analogs in graphs, all of which reminded me of Professor Charles Wells: <a href="https://conceptualmathematics.substack.com/p/if-blah-then-blah-blah-mathematical-definitions?utm_source=publication-search">The way you can word a definition affects the properties of the thing defined.</a></p>
