<p>More STEM students are a good thing, right? Which is why the Australian government has just used this rationale to <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-06-19/university-fees-tertiary-education-overhaul-course-costs/12367742">promote its reform of higher education funding</a> --- claiming it'd create more "job-ready" graduates --- that will actually <a href="https://medium.com/@antonyeagle/changes-to-australian-higher-education-funding-an-attack-on-expertise-89b1659e845">cut funding</a> for the STEM (and other "job-ready") disciplines, and potentially encourage universities to enrol more students whose course fees would rise under the reform.</p>

Nonetheless, those numbers are utterly astounding. After the impact of climate change on Australia (land and sea) over the past five years, how do they have the gall to so utterly wreck the funding for environmental studies??</p>

<p>Look at the "Maths" line: the increase in federal government (i.e. "Commonwealth") contribution is outweighed by the decrease in student contribution, for an overall cut in funding. </p>

<p>For the Coalition, who have been in power for most of the 21st century, they are strongly in favour of fossil fuels because Australia has a lot of good quality coal that is in demand around the world: mostly China, but India also buys it as well. There was the mining boom in the 2000s, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_in_Australia">mining</a> has always been a major industry for Australia. So the Coalition, being the business-friendly centre-right type, have tended to pursue policies that are friendly to mining operations.</p>

<p>For Labor, I think the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/31/only-way-labour-win-ditch-labourism-corbyn">analysis of Jeremy GIlbert</a> applies: they suffer from "Laborism" in the same way Labour suffers from "Labourism". When they come to power, they have always done so without an official coalition, so much so that in Australia, the word "coalition" has come to mean "the" Coalition of the Liberals and the Nationals. <br>
When the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens">Australian Greens</a> became a new political force, the <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/opinion/greens-clip-labors-left-wing-20021130-gduuu1.html">first instinct</a> of Labor was to <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/national/labor-fighting-to-stop-lefts-flight-to-greens-20040905-gdykyd.html">sabotage that rise</a>. Consequently, that meant attacking the environmentalist policies of the Greens, which were perceived to cost jobs earlier on. <br>
After the 2019 election, they have decided that green policies don't win elections, and the current Labor leader seems to be more conciliatory towards new mining projects, in an attempt to win rural voters... who're divided, incidentally, on environmental issues, because the mining agenda is in conflict with the agricultural agenda.</p>

<p>However, the popular perception, thanks to the Murdoch press (which has its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_Corp_Australia#History">roots</a> in Adelaide), is that environmental issues are the province of inner-city types. This is why, when the Deputy PM (and Nationals leader) Michael McCormack belittled the bushfire concerns late last year as <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/i-d-like-a-raving-inner-city-lunatic-t-shirt-for-christmas-please-20191112-p539tg.html">"the ravings of some pure, enlightened and woke capital-city greenies"</a>, it took a concerted campaign to get people to realise that "greenies" can also be rural voters (e.g. farmers) as well. Agriculture is also another major (export) industry of Australia, but somehow the Coalition doesn't seem to care as much about the environmental impact on agriculture. I'm not sure why that's the case.</p>

<p>So, how do they have the gall? The Coalition, because they can, and they're only "listening to the voters" who'd given them the mandate during the last election; Labor, because they're still cautious from losing the election that was "theirs to lose".</p>

<p>Well, not exactly. The Coalition campaign had good spin doctors (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Morrison">Morrison</a> is one himself) who went on to <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-08/topham-guerins-boomer-meme-industrial-complex/11682116">work for Johnson's campaign</a>.

<p>Although it is frustrating, one needs to understand how the machinery of government operates to get desirable results. You see what the available programs are and you apply for them. I've been connected with the Dept of Ed for almost four decades and I believe they are looking for creative solutions for STEM projects. NOTE: I only speak for myself. The Dept of Ed is interested in technical vocational training. Personally I question whether these people would benefit more from a semester of CT than the standard three semesters of calculus. What this group of people has to sell is their ability to reason about systems and systems of systems.</p>

<p>The point was that there would be a <em>negative net change</em> in total per-student income, i.e. a funding cut, for most STEM courses. I'm rather confused as to why you're confused.</p>

<p>Although it is frustrating, one needs to understand how the machinery of government operates to get desirable results. You see what the available programs are and you apply for them. </p>

<p>I agree, but a lot of people apply for the available programs without that understanding, which is why you get a lot of frustrated academics.</p>

<p>The point was that there would be a <em>negative net change</em> in total per-student income, i.e. a funding cut, for most STEM courses. I'm rather confused as to why you're confused.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not confused, my point is that I have no way of knowing either the current per-student course costs or other relevant data to assess the concrete impact of these changes, which are bound to vary between courses. A net loss of 9,000 dollars per student to environmental studies is going to matter a lot more if their current income is 10,000 than if it's (to take an extreme value) 100,000. I also have no way of knowing what biases previous legislation had introduced to the relative incomes for these courses: maybe dental care degrees were already getting a disproportionate amount of funding and that disparity has just grown even more? I can't extract that kind of information from this data.</p>

<p>Got it. <a href="https://www.dese.gov.au/document/better-university-funding-arrangements-reducing-complexity-and-targeting-job-ready">Here</a>'s where you can get the document summarising the current and new funding levels.</p>

<p>Mostly STEM departments, with the notable exception of "IT". I don't think this is the final word on it, though. Usually, if people make enough of a fuss, the government tends to back off a little. The Coalition probably still remembers how they lost to Labor over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WorkChoices">WorkChoices</a>.</p>
