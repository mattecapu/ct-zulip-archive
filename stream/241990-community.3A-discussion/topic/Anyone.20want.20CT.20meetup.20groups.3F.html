<p>As some people might know, there are two applied category theory meetup groups, each approximately 1000 strong, one in <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Categorical-Databases/">Boston</a>, and one in <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Category-Theory/">SF</a>.  They've hosted talks from myself, topos folks, Microsoft folks, Apache folks, and many more.   I'm reaching out to ask if anyone wants to organize (meetup slang for 'own') these two groups; all that is required is a (paid) meetup subscription, as the community provides plenty of content.  We don't mind maintaining ownership as Conexus, but have long wanted to donate the groups to the community, so here I am!</p>

<p>Sounds like fun, but it seems most sensible to have someone in the US leading those groups.</p>

<p>Would it make sense to have some people in Boston lead the Boston one, and some people in the Bay Area lead the SF one?   Or are the economies of scale so great that it's better to have one person, or organization, do all the work?</p>

<p>There's already the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/category_theory/">NYC Category Theory and Algebra</a> meetup, with about 700 members (though I bet these numbers consist mainly of people who aren't very active).</p>
<p>it would be nice to have it connected somehow with the <a href="https://researchseminars.org/seminar/Category_Theory">New York Category Theory Seminar</a>.  Maybe just informally: like, they should both announce each other's events.</p>

<p>Yeah I’ve given a couple talks at the NYC category theory seminar and help Noson advertise it here. I’ve been thinking about if its worth it to try and do a NYC ACT group as well. The other group seems to be more of a reading group, they’ve been working through Hatcher for algebraic topology I think?</p>

<p>It isn't really a matter of leadership - anyone with a free meetup subscription can lead any group, and groups can be led by multiple people (meetup calls these people 'organizers').  It is a matter of who wants to pay meetup several hundred dollars a year to be the 'owner' of the group; basically, they just get the bill.  So independently of who owns the meetups, I would encourage people here to do as they suggest, and try to re-invigorate the groups, which should be doable in their current state (certainly I can make people organizers of the two CT groups, lmk).  Meetups can be online only, or in person; meetup is basically just providing the equivalent of a mailing list with a calendar to RSVP to.</p>

<p>So are you saying that Conexus would be willing to keep pay the Meetup fee, but then somebody else organizes the group? Say (theoretically) I want to organize a global categorical database theory group and I want Conexus to foot the bill. Would that cost extra? Or would I have to specifically lead one of those two groups (Boston and SF) that already exist</p>

<p>To clarify, right now the two CT meetups owned by Conexus have been dormant for a while, and anyone is welcome to lead them (requires free meetup subscription), or to take ownership of them (requires pro meetup subscription), or both.  that is all</p>

<p>On the other side of the Atlantic, if anyone wanted to organize something like that in London or Oxford, I'd be happy to help. (I can't be the main organizer though, I'm too busy already.)</p>

<p>The meetups found a new owner in Lynn Bender, who has some graph meetups. Given the ever increasing financial obligation to meetup itself, I'm not sure I'd recommend their platform over say, EventBrite</p>
