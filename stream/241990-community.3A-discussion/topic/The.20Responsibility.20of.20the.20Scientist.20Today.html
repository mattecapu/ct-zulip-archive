<p>I would like to share this article:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://matematicas.unex.es/~navarro/res/scientist.pdf">The Responsibility of the Scientist Today</a>, Alexandre Grothendieck, 1970</li>
</ul>
<p>Grothendieck posits that scientists have a responsibility to humanity as a whole,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The scientist, as the principal architect of technological progress, must assume a major part of the responsibility for the unprecedented dangers that modern technology has posed for mankind.  Better informed than the majority of the human population, the scientist has no excuse for closing his eyes to the imminence and the dimensions ofthe perils he has helped to create.  Because most countries (whether communist or capitalist) are anxious to preserve their precious "gray matter", the scientist is generally treated like a spoiled child in today's world, enjoying privileges which are denied to vast numbers of people: good working conditions, comfortable surroundings, financial security, more extended means of information, repeated contacts with colleagues from other countries, more leisure time, greater freedom to learn and to reflect . .. *  The scientist enjoys an undeniable prestige among the general public (reflecting the prestige attached to technological prowess) and an enviable material security.  No one could be less justified in claiming "helplessness" or "personal insecurity" as an excuse for doing nothing to combat the dangers already cited –if only to the extent of refusing to collaborate with the military and warning the public of the real gravity of the situation.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>and argues that even passive collaboration with the military is an abdication of this responsibility</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While only a small number of scientists work directly for the military. virtually all scientists collaborate "passively" by accepting army contracts, or by organizing seminars or colloquia financed partially or totally by military funds, without even giving it a second thought.  In doing so, scientists have willingly cooperated in establishing the powerful grip that the military now has on "pure" scientific research, to some extent throughout the western world, but particularly in the USA.  The domination of pure scientific research by military money has finally alarmed even the civil authorities, who have judged it necessary to limit the practice –much to the disappointment of the scientists, who would prefer to see the "military manna" continue unabated.  Practically all the scientists of the western world have accepted, or would accept if the opportunity presented itself, military subventions whether for private research, or for the organization of specific scientific activities, or in the form of salary from an institution regularly furnished with military funds.  The massive collaboration of the scientific community with the army  (often at the same time that the most savage wars are being prosecuted by that same army) is the greatest. It is also the most obvious sign of their abdication of responsibility toward human society.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These words reflect my personal values. I would like to discuss this with the category theory community in a non-judgemental way, so we can get a better idea of where everyone stands on this issue.</p>

<p>That would be nice, but in this article Grothendieck is also arguing against more passive collaboration with the military than what Bob and David do...e.g. collaborating with people who work with military. I am interested in perspectives from people who do that as well.</p>

<p>Is your point that category theory has benefited a lot from military money in the past, so it can't be that bad of a thing?</p>

<p>So from my perspective as a European, this mostly seems to be the question of "should you accept funding from the american army", because I haven't heard of any other army funding research (do the russian or chinese militaries offer research money?). So I think it should be more of a question of convincing the american public that they need to give less money to the military and more to the universities. Telling researchers to not accept available funding while competition is killing seems to me to put the burden of morality in the wrong place</p>

<p>So from my perspective as a European, this mostly seems to be the question of "should you accept funding from the american army", because I haven't heard of any other army funding research (do the russian or chinese militaries offer research money?). So I think it should be more of a question of convincing the american public that they need to give less money to the military and more to the universities. Telling researchers to not accept available funding while competition is killing seems to me to put the burden of morality in the wrong place</p>

<p>Even within the US military it's hard to put blame on particular people, it is a massive bureaucracy and there are some people whose work is a genuine positive in the world.  The thing with massive bureaucracies is everyone shares a small amount of the blame, so it is our personality responsibility to do what can to make things better.</p>

<p>As for me, I'm trying to use category theory (and lots of other math) to help understand some things about chemistry, biology, ecology and economics.  You could say I'm trying to understand open systems, how they process information, how they evolve, how they thrive or fail to thrive... but also that I constantly get side-tracked by the beautiful math that seems to be the prerequisite  for understanding these things.</p>
<p>In the process I became a subcontractor for the DARPA program called CASCADE, for <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/10/02/complex-adaptive-system-design-part-1/">Complex Adaptive System Composition and Design Environment</a>.  I had some misgivings about this... decided to give it a try... came up with some cool stuff, helped fund <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275953">@Blake Pollard</span> and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275914">@Joe Moeller</span>, who both went on to get jobs at NIST based in part on this work... and eventually got frustrated and quit, mainly because the program was not set up to give us time to explore the ideas I thought were interesting, but also because the intended military applications became more clear, and I didn't want to pursue those goals.</p>
<p>More recently I've been talking to James Fairbanks and Evan Patterson about biochemistry: using math to infer Petri nets with rates from data.  This is actually a big topic in biochemistry, though of course not many people are trying to use category theory.   James has gotten grant money from the Defense Department for this project, but I'm not letting that deter me, because the benefits of what we're doing outweigh any harm it might do.</p>

<p>As for me, I'm trying to use category theory (and lots of other math) to help understand some things about chemistry, biology, ecology and economics.  You could say I'm trying to understand open systems, how they process information, how they evolve, how they thrive or fail to thrive... but also that I constantly get side-tracked by the beautiful math that seems to be the prerequisite  for understanding these things.</p>
<p>In the process I became a subcontractor for the DARPA program called CASCADE, for <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2016/10/02/complex-adaptive-system-design-part-1/">Complex Adaptive System Composition and Design Environment</a>.  I had some misgivings about this... decided to give it a try... came up with some cool stuff, helped fund <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="275953">Blake Pollard</span> and <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="275914">Joe Moeller</span>, who both went on to get jobs at NIST based in part on this work... and eventually got frustrated and quit, mainly because the program was not set up to give us time to explore the ideas I thought were interesting, but also because the intended military applications became more clear, and I didn't want to pursue those goals.</p>
<p>More recently I've been talking to James Fairbanks and Evan Patterson about biochemistry: using math to infer Petri nets with rates from data.  This is actually a big topic in biochemistry, though of course not many people are trying to use category theory.   James has gotten grant money from the Defense Department for this project, but I'm not letting that deter me, because the benefits of what we're doing outweigh any harm it might do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not to interrogate you in particular, but why are you so sure the benefits outweigh the harm. Can you know for certain what sort of collaborations your work will lead to in the future?</p>

<p>So from my perspective as a European, this mostly seems to be the question of "should you accept funding from the american army", because I haven't heard of any other army funding research (do the russian or chinese militaries offer research money?). So I think it should be more of a question of convincing the american public that they need to give less money to the military and more to the universities. Telling researchers to not accept available funding while competition is killing seems to me to put the burden of morality in the wrong place</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not making a comment on whether or not one should take money from the US millitary, but I really dislike the fact that people very often automatically assume that decisions made in America's supposed best interest are in my nation's own best interest.  People would perhaps act less sanctimoniously if non-western militaries were offering money.</p>

<p>So I understand on a intuitive level that accepting military funding is icky, but I'm having a hard time accepting the argument of "you never know what they are going to use the research for". The cases I'm aware of, Bob Coecke working on CQM and natural language stuff, he had complete freedom in choosing his research. So the research would have been the same whether funded by regular grants, or by the military. So if the argument is that the military might use it for bad things, then why isn't this a problem if it is not funded by the military? Or is the argument more that you are normalising the presence of military things in academia?</p>

<p>There's a little more to it. On the one hand, it's putting a hand up to the fact that the whole of the origins of computing come from war effort. On the other hand, it's a desirable property of nukes that their navigation strategy is independent of their target.</p>

<p>Let me turn around the question: I haven't really heard any super convincing argument to not accept the funding other than "military bad" and  a vague notion of not wanting to normalise military in research. Now, while I agree with these things and they would be enough reason to stop me doing something less important, like say, skip going to some store, this is about my livelihood. So I would hope there were some more concrete arguments. Like, if someone could point me towards some researcher accepting funding and then later being screwed over by the military, or his research being used in a bad way. Or a branch of research where military funding is very normalised and this leading to bad outcomes for the research or society</p>

<p>My first thought is, the world of 2021 is (as far as I know) a much more <em>complicated</em> place to live than the world of 1970. Back then it was pretty straightforward: the world consisted of 2 superpowers vying for dominance, and there would either be a nuclear apocalypse or there wouldn't, no middle option was likely. Life in 2021 is much more subtle than that. There are still the big-E Evils, like the US military, BAE systems and whatever, the people who go out and shoot civilians. We also have to worry about the compound effect of a bunch of way more subtle evils</p>

<p>I'm not "so sure".     I just follow my instincts.    If I were trying to be certain about things I would never have worked on n-category theory, and I never would have gotten interested in applied category theory; a lot of people thought these ideas were crazy.

<p>It'd be interesting to see how strong is the correlation between research being funded by the military and technology being developed for the military. Unless they figured out a wonderful pipeline for turning science into technology, it seems unlikely they are extracting more technology than they would if they didn't fund researchers directly (and I think that's why they rain money on everyone: the only thing they can exploit is volume).<br>
This disqualifies the moral responsibility of scientists for military technology, imo, at least for those who work far enough from the actual development (of course von Braun is quite responsible for V2 missiles, but Newton?).<br>
So to me the big problem is to have the military controlling research-space, which is quite awful. Also I guess everybody would be enrolled in the next Manhattan project as soon as something bad happens.</p>

<p>Let me clarify a bit more about "military bad" not being intrinsically being enough. The US government is putting children in cages on the border, and depriving people of healthcare, which are grade A evil in my book. Does that mean accepting funding trough the US government is also a no-no?</p>

<p>I understand what John says... We don't want to slippery slope our way into not accepting funds from anyone. Fab, I'd say even crypto might be criticized as being highly unethical in some respects: it enables a lot of criminal activity, and BTC is now an additional nation our already overexploited planet has to support.<br>
I guess John is rightly asking how to we discriminate between 'bad' and 'good', because it's easy to find the bad in a lot of stuff.</p>

<p>Personally I'd prefer a military having a smaller budget and more research funded directly, but assuming we can't choose the size of the budget (I'm not a voter in US), it seems obvious to me that it's better spent on no-strings-attached grants on category theory than on whatever their alternative is (but I'm willing to be convinced otherwise). Kinda like I think it's good that CIA spent all that money on modern art back in the day than did more of whatever they were otherwise up to.</p>

<p>Let me clarify a bit more about "military bad" not being intrinsically being enough. The US government is putting children in cages on the border, and depriving people of healthcare, which are grade A evil in my book. Does that mean accepting funding trough the US government is also a no-no?</p>

<p>And yes, once you start questioning things, it's hard to find any unambiguously clean source of funding. So it becomes a question of where each individual will draw an arbitrary line in the middle of a spectrum of greys</p>

<p>Personally I'd prefer a military having a smaller budget and more research funded directly, but assuming we can't choose the size of the budget (I'm not a voter in US), it seems obvious to me that it's better spent on no-strings-attached grants on category theory than on whatever their alternative is (but I'm willing to be convinced otherwise). Kinda like I think it's good that CIA spent all that money on modern art back in the day than did more of whatever they were otherwise up to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first no is to the idea that that it's harmless to be funded for doing something useless. Apart from anything else, it makes the funder look benevolent, which they may not be.</p>
<p>The second no is to the assertion that the research is useless.</p>

<p>So from my perspective as a European, this mostly seems to be the question of "should you accept funding from the american army", because I haven't heard of any other army funding research (do the russian or chinese militaries offer research money?). So I think it should be more of a question of convincing the american public that they need to give less money to the military and more to the universities. Telling researchers to not accept available funding while competition is killing seems to me to put the burden of morality in the wrong place</p>

<p>That + they seem more benevolent when they do research as well + they might be able to direct research in directions they like. Given all this, I agree that it's preferrable if science was funded directly rather than via the military, but I'm not sure that's the choice we're making. On the margin, the military either gives the money for some particular research or it does something else. In the case of Mac Lane (or other projects mentioned in the comments), it's not obvious to me that this "something else" is a better use of that same money.</p>

<p>"The DoD wants to normalize themselves in your non-mathematical communities."<br>
So, I still don't buy this argument. To me it feels that the only thing we're normalising is the accepting of <em>funding</em> from the military. I mean, some of us here have directly benefited from military funding and yet we are still all in agreement that the military is evil and should be defunded.</p>
<p>As a side-note: if you are funded by military and have to include a "This research was funded by..." blurb in the Acknowledgements of your paper, could you then also add another line saying "I think the military is evil, I'm only accepting this money because I need funding", or would that be dissallowed by your grant?</p>

<p>Okay, I think we might have different ideas about what it entails to accept funding from the military. I'm coming from the viewpoint of Bob, where as far as I understand, he basically got money to do what he wants, without any further interaction with any researchers or employees of the military. If there were such interactions I think there is a much stronger case that this is a bad^{tm} thing to do.</p>

<p>That + they seem more benevolent when they do research as well + they might be able to direct research in directions they like. Given all this, I agree that it's preferrable if science was funded directly rather than via the military, but I'm not sure that's the choice we're making. On the margin, the military either gives the money for some particular research or it does something else. In the case of Mac Lane (or other projects mentioned in the comments), it's not obvious to me that this "something else" is a better use of that same money.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Grothendieck had a great response to this;</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>However,  by  accepting  their  funds  through  military  channels,  scientists  help  to augment  the  importance  of  themilitary  in  the  life  of  the  nation –to  the  extent  that  the army finances research, the part of the national revenue devoted to the military will be increased  accordingly.    Thus  even  if  scientists  accept  massive  amounts  from  the military, it will not diminish –even by one –the number of weapons the army has at its disposal, nor the number of victims massacred by this same army when it is engaged in a  war,  as  is  actually  the  case  in  the  USA <br>
[...]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The support of pure scientific research lends a degree of respectability and even an aura  of  innocence  to  the  army.    How  can  one  hope  that  the  man-in-the-street  or  the politician  will  wake  up  to  these  ignoble  escapades  that  might  prove  fatal  to  all  of  us, when he sees the entire scientific community collaborating with the very apparatus that poses these threats?<br>
[...]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Certainly  research  is  an  agreeable  activity  for  those  who  engage  in  it, sometimes   even   exalting.      That   doesn't   establish   its   utility,   or   that   its   positive consequences,  outweigh  the  negative  ones.    Too  often  it  has  served  the  vilification  of man,  from  the  beginning  of  the  industrial  revolution  until  today,  when  it  may  well prove  to  be  the  tool  of  its  own  final  destruction.    In  fact  the  men  whose  activities  have been  the  most  dangerous  and  deadly  for  humanity  over  the  past  thirty  years  are  not heads  of  state,  nor  generals,  but  scientists –for  without  them,  the  military  would  have remained  relatively  inoffensive. From  this  global  perspective,  I  am  convinced  that  no scientific  discovery,  however  useful  it  may  appear  to  be,  can  compensate  for  or  justify the collaboration of a scientist with the military.<br>

<p>I'm not being obtuse on purpose - I'm just trying to learn. But I guess the point is that army will point to funding research in general and to particular technological breaktroughs made with the money when puffing themselves, not to Mac Lanes and stuff that are harder to sell to whoever is the puffee.</p>

<p>Grothendieck said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus even if scientists accept massive amounts from the military, it will not diminish –even by one –the number of weapons the army has at its disposal, nor the number of victims massacred by this same army when it is engaged in a war, as is actually the case in the USA </p>

<p>This one I don't find obvious - I now think it's nontrivial to estimate whether funding taken by scientists decreases the remaining army budget, doesn't change it all or increases it (due to them looking better).</p>

<p>Couldn't you also put this the other way: the military is more likely to want to fund research that will have <em>some</em> impact on society, while most math research does not have any impact. As random research that has an affect on society is more likely to be positive than negative (debatable), it is positive utility to accept military funding as it forces you to think about research that has some impact on society.</p>

<p>Like I can really see it going either way - for some level of funding, giving more to science gives you even more back from the taxpayer, and at some point it'll give less. It's not at all clear to me where we are on that curve.</p>

<p>Oh dear, this conversation on this forum, including the very existence of this forum would not have happened if it wasn't for accepting money that was without constraints, the easiest money whatever, whether it came from military or religious fanatics.  Many people writing here wouldn't have been in academia at all.  Not gonna start naming people but from what I know that's surely 50+ and probably 100+ at least, several in this conversation.  You want them all to vanish like in the Avengers?  Just klick your fingers then, I'll provide you with their names.  The fact that there is now this flourishing ACT community, as well as QPL, quantum foundations etc.  wouldn't have happened without that. If you are not mainstream, you have to seek alternative resources.   The reality is that with the exception of some CS places in Europe, CT was dying 20 years ago, big centres were evaporating.   I was unemployed, since the CT community driven by utopian sofa ideology had not taken care at all of its offspring, being just busy with person cults. The end of the species was looming.  I spend a major chunk of the past 20 years, and continuing to do so now, to generate jobs for enabling people to do interesting things.   We build a group through which some 300 people came trough, now having their own groups elsewhere.  You want them all to vanish?  I can give the names.  Tell them.  "When we take money, we endorse the people from whom we take money", yeah right, and the military is going to get more money because of some category theoretician respecting them, right.  What I have seen instead  is that people who helped us are doing so because they believe in good science and have a hell of a job trying to justify that to their admirals.  I have seen some of those loose their jobs cause they gave money to people like me; I have a lot more respect for them than for sofa ideologists who don't bother to help with the procreation of their community.  (yes, I am an animal)  Cheers!</p>

<p>Right, there are different forms funding can take. Jade had a close second-hand view of John and I working on this DARPA project where they had a project, and we joined in on it, via the company Metron. This is very different than just getting handed a bunch of money to do what you like.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the way, you never get handed money to do <em>whatever</em> you like.  You have to write grant applications and at least <em>claim</em> you're going to work on some "hot topic".   People who repeatedly get grants tend to be ones that succeed in doing approximately what they claimed they'd do.  So the whole grantsmanship game - which dominates the sciences these days - really pushes people toward "hot topics".</p>
<p>But you're right about this: what you and I had was not a grant, it was a <em>subcontract</em> - so we were being bossed around more.</p>

<p>von Neumann was a complicated man. If I remember correctly from the biography I read he escaped Hungary when it come under soviet control, and he felt Stalin was the most dangerous man in the world, and really unpredictable. But I don't think he advocated a preemptive strike, just that the united states should be scary enough that Stalin wouldn't try anything</p>

<p>Yes it's used in lots of places, unfortunately I believe that capitalism incentivises the use of these technologies for things which exploit and kill...so that's what it gets used for more than the things that do good.</p>

<p>I saw earlier in a conversation that I am not very typical, and neither is our CEO, who is funding the Topos institute and is the reason for their stance against a bunch of modern bad stuff by big companies, so maybe we have a chance. :)  I always have been pretty extreme left-wing, so is he, so is Ross Duncan, the 2nd highest scientist in the company, so maybe we have a chance; if there is going to be a problem it's the Trotsky vs Bakounin vs Lenin thing.  (Bakounin (aka me) survived the longest btw).</p>

<p>In 1950 Life magazine quoted the great Hungarian-American physicist John Von Neumann, co-father of both the atom bomb and the digital computer, advocating immediate pre-emptive nuclear war against Russia: “If you say why not bomb them tomorrow, I say why not today? If you say today at 5 o’clock, I say why not one o’clock?” He was hardly alone. Generals and members of Congress were making the same arguments.</p>

<p>I got this, "big disjunction" from Borceux, or Benabou, or...from other old people.  The Manhatten project was not just an isolated nucleus I remember from their stories, but involved many other branches of US Science, and that's how the two of them got involved; they worked on he obligatory stuff during the day, and other stuff at night.  I am pretty sure of this story.  I'll check for details with people...</p>

<p>I think it will hopefully get us closer to understanding why we fuck up so much.  The world is too cartesian, as advocated by many of the fathers of category theory.  Cartesian means borders between nations, genders, ethnicities, etc.  (and punks vs normal people in my days)   I see the quantum paradigm as a  way to blur those borders, and understand the fluidity and potential of richness vs compartments.</p>

<p>I removed the message, as it was only a bad joke that didn't need to be made. I think one of the differences that people are not paying attention to is that in Europe there are, besides individual countries' NSF-like funders such as EPSRC, the EU, and their frameworks. While in the USA there's this pretense of commercial innovation, but actually the infrastructure work has always been paid by the military:  the silicon chips, the internet,  even the GPU revolution (that we tend to say came about because of the porn -- and the games) was originally supported by the military. I understand that when we accept their money, we give them some credibility that I wish I didn't have to give. But I also think that the money they spent on CT is a dent in the money they spent on killing robots and other technologies much more clearly lethal.

<p>FWIW I appreciate much more the detailed and honest anecdotes of actual funding examples (eg Bob, John), than people saying "No, and no" (for example) and then taking O(100) posts of discussion to then clarify they are <em>not actually against funding,</em> but against people telling themselves little stories to justify taking funding so they can sleep comfortably at night (and I mean that in both senses).</p>
<p>People bring up Grothendieck dropping out as a paragon.</p>
<p>I personally am willing, <em>and have,</em> taken a manual job when funding ran out, being paid ~$1.20 per package delivered, pre-tax. I now have a bigger family and also no second, part-time income coming in, so it will probably make things quite difficult if I have to resort to that again. There is no hypothetical for me about having to resort to leaving academica for lack of funding, since I will be gone by the end of the year, and I as yet have no plan, and I have commitments to my extended family here and so moving elsewhere for a university job is not an option. The only other major employer of mathematicians in my city is ... guess who. So I appreciate being told constructive stories by people who struggled through managing to build a career.</p>

<p>I would like to share this article:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://matematicas.unex.es/~navarro/res/scientist.pdf">The Responsibility of the Scientist Today</a>, Alexandre Grothendieck, 1970</li>
</ul>
<p>Grothendieck posits that scientists have a responsibility to humanity as a whole,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The scientist, as the principal architect of technological progress, must assume a major part of the responsibility for the unprecedented dangers that modern technology has posed for mankind.  Better informed than the majority of the human population, the scientist has no excuse for closing his eyes to the imminence and the dimensions ofthe perils he has helped to create.  Because most countries (whether communist or capitalist) are anxious to preserve their precious "gray matter", the scientist is generally treated like a spoiled child in today's world, enjoying privileges which are denied to vast numbers of people: good working conditions, comfortable surroundings, financial security, more extended means of information, repeated contacts with colleagues from other countries, more leisure time, greater freedom to learn and to reflect . .. *  The scientist enjoys an undeniable prestige among the general public (reflecting the prestige attached to technological prowess) and an enviable material security.  No one could be less justified in claiming "helplessness" or "personal insecurity" as an excuse for doing nothing to combat the dangers already cited –if only to the extent of refusing to collaborate with the military and warning the public of the real gravity of the situation.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>and argues that even passive collaboration with the military is an abdication of this responsibility</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While only a small number of scientists work directly for the military. virtually all scientists collaborate "passively" by accepting army contracts, or by organizing seminars or colloquia financed partially or totally by military funds, without even giving it a second thought.  In doing so, scientists have willingly cooperated in establishing the powerful grip that the military now has on "pure" scientific research, to some extent throughout the western world, but particularly in the USA.  The domination of pure scientific research by military money has finally alarmed even the civil authorities, who have judged it necessary to limit the practice –much to the disappointment of the scientists, who would prefer to see the "military manna" continue unabated.  Practically all the scientists of the western world have accepted, or would accept if the opportunity presented itself, military subventions whether for private research, or for the organization of specific scientific activities, or in the form of salary from an institution regularly furnished with military funds.  The massive collaboration of the scientific community with the army  (often at the same time that the most savage wars are being prosecuted by that same army) is the greatest. It is also the most obvious sign of their abdication of responsibility toward human society.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These words reflect my personal values. I would like to discuss this with the category theory community in a non-judgemental way, so we can get a better idea of where everyone stands on this issue.</p>
<p><div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>I respect this POV but strongly disagree with the idea that military R&amp;D is a bad thing in its own right, to say nothing of my belief that it is by far the greatest catalyst for technological development

<p>Einstein's willingness to collaborate with the US military led to the development and use of nuclear weapons. I hope we can learn from his mistakes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would like to make sure everyone what actually happened here.  As usual, I'm not secretly trying to make some point: when I want to make a point I try to make it directly.  I just think it's good to know the history.  "Willingness to collaborate with the military" is a somewhat odd way to describe what Einstein did.</p>
<p>Briefly: during WWII the physicist Leo Szilard spent a lot of time sitting in his bathtub pondering nuclear fission, which had been discovered by the German chemist Hahn and the German Jewish physicist Lise Meitner in 1938.</p>
<p>He realized that it could be used to make a bomb - which may sound obvious, but is not really: it's not trivial to build a nuclear weapon.   He realized that the Nazis would try to do this - which turned out to be true: the Nazi bomb project was led by Heisenberg.    And he decided that the US had to build its own bomb, or at least look into whether it was really possible.</p>
<p>So he decided to write a letter to president Roosevelt advocating this.  But he knew Roosevelt wouldn't listen to him, so he decide to enlist the help of the most famous physicist in the world, the only one whose letter Roosevelt might read: Einstein.</p>
<p>And so they wrote a letter to Roosevelt, and after a while Roosevelt started the Manhattan Project.</p>
<p>Einstein wasn't involved in the Manhattan Project at all... except for starting it, which of course is huge: I'm not trying to minimize that!</p>

<p>Here's the letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>August 2nd, 1939</p>
<p>F.D. Roosevelt,<br>
President of the United States,<br>
White House<br>
Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Sir:</p>
<p>Some recent work by E. Fermi and L. Szilard, which has been communicated to me in manuscript, leads me to expect that the element uranium may be turned into a new and important source of energy in the immediate future. Certain aspects of the situation which has arisen seem to call for watchfulness and, if necessary, quick action on the part of the Administration. I believe therefore that it is my duty to bring to your attention the following facts and recommendations:</p>
<p>In the course of the last four months it has been made probable—through the work of Joliot in France as well as Fermi and Szilard in America—that it may become possible to set up a nuclear chain reaction in a large mass of uranium by which vast amounts of power and large quantities of new radium-like elements would be generated. Now it appears almost certain that this could be achieved in the immediate future.</p>
<p>This phenomenon would also lead to the construction of bombs, and it is conceivable—though much less certain—that extremely powerful bombs of a new type may thus be constructed. A single bomb of this type, carried by boat and exploded in a port, might very well destroy the whole port together with some of the surrounding territory. However, such bombs might very well prove to be too heavy for transportation by air.</p>
<p>The United States has only very poor ores of uranium in moderate quantities. There is some good ore in Canada and the former Czechoslovakia, while the most important source of uranium is Belgian Congo.</p>
<p>In view of this situation you may think it desirable to have some permanent contact maintained between the Administration and the group of physicists working on chain reactions in America. One possible way of achieving this might be for you to entrust with this task a person who has your confidence and who could perhaps serve in an inofficial capacity. His task might comprise the following:</p>
<p>a)  to approach Government Departments, keep them informed of the further development, and put forward recommendations for Government action, giving particular attention to the problem of securing a supply of uranium ore for the United States.</p>
<p>b)  to speed up the experimental work, which is at present being carried on within the limits of the budgets of University laboratories, by providing funds, if such funds be required, through his contacts with private persons who are willing to make contributions for this cause, and perhaps also by obtaining the co-operation of industrial laboratories which have the necessary equipment.</p>
<p>I understand that Germany has actually stopped the sale of uranium from the Czechoslovakian mines which she has taken over. That she should have taken such early action might perhaps be understood on the ground that the son of the German Under-Secretary of State, von Weizsäcker, is attached to the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut in Berlin where some of the American work on uranium is now being repeated.</p>
<p>Yours very truly,</p>
<p>Albert Einstein</p>

<p>Einstein never worked on the Manhattan Project; indeed he was denied a security clearance in 1940 because of his pacifist beliefs. He later had misgivings about his role in creating the Manhattan Project, saying, “Had I known that the Germans would not succeed in develop­ing an atomic bomb, I would have done nothing for the bomb.”</p>

<p>I respect this POV but am on record as strongly disagreeing with the premise that military R&amp;D is a bad thing. I think it’s a huge boon to society on balance. You can have vicious conflicts without any particular technological sophistication but you can’t have mRNA vaccines or the internet or self-driving cars or interplanetary exploration without military R&amp;D.</p>

<p>Right, there are different forms funding can take. Jade had a close second-hand view of John and I working on this DARPA project where they had a project, and we joined in on it, via the company Metron. This is very different than just getting handed a bunch of money to do what you like.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the way, you never get handed money to do <em>whatever</em> you like.  You have to write grant applications and at least <em>claim</em> you're going to work on some "hot topic".   People who repeatedly get grants tend to be ones that succeed in doing approximately what they claimed they'd do.  So the whole grantsmanship game - which dominates the sciences these days - really pushes people toward "hot topics".</p>
<p>But you're right about this: what you and I had was not a grant, it was a <em>subcontract</em> - so we were being bossed around more.</p>

<p>The UK did a very smart bit of cold war strategy, which is that <em>all</em> of its launch-ready nukes are on submarines. (That system's called Trident, which is a really good name). That very strongly discourages being the target of a preemptive strike. The place that's up the road from Glasgow is where the nuclear-armed submarines come into dock</p>

<p>The very fact that military personnel are responsible for funding decisions, and that they have to justify these as strategic decisions to their superiors, possibly putting their jobs on the line as Bob mentioned earlier, is absurd.<br>

<p>What I have seen instead  is that people who helped us are doing so because they believe in good science and have a hell of a job trying to justify that to their admirals.  I have seen some of those loose their jobs cause they gave money to people like me; I have a lot more respect for them than for sofa ideologists who don't bother to help with the procreation of their community. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know that us discussing this here on Zulip isn't going to have a big impact on how government funding reaches researchers in the short term, but if boycotting military funding whenever possible represents an eventual positive move towards taking military structures out of the equation, that seems like a positive reason to do so.</p>

<p>So one thing I have been told by them, is that they want certain things out in the open rather than in secret in some Russian secret lab.  With our DisCoCat funding that must have been the case.  AFOSR recently also tweeted a big picture of me playing guitar stating that they were proud about once funding me and that this work has contributed to a thing in industry now.  Here's the tweet:<br>

How should one interpret that?  The work we did was all the work with Mehrnoosh, Martha Lewis, Dan Marsden and Dimitri Kartsaklis on DisCoCat, very well known to you,  and the 1st QNLP paper with Will Zeng, leading to my CQC team.  Thanks to the money this is now a big area in ACT as well.  </p>

<p>I know that us discussing this here on Zulip isn't going to have a big impact on how government funding reaches researchers in the short term, but if boycotting military funding whenever possible represents an eventual positive move towards taking military structures out of the equation, that seems like a positive reason to do so.</p>

<p>It's the simple cartesian vs non-cartesian point of view.  Lawvere developed much of his category theory from a Leninist point of view.  But that was a very Cartesian point of view.  Embracing the world to be truly monoidal, gives a different view on humanity, at least for me.  So what I was referring to was more the acceptance of nature being non-cartesian.  Technology can contribute to major changes in worldview.</p>

<p>Not all rich people are like that.  I know some were it is the other way around: being rich enables one to do good things.  We talk all the time how ultimately CQC can contribute to a better world, where the big tech companies now messed-up big time.</p>

The question is whether knowing this fact, was crucial for developing atomic bombs.  And I don't think so!   What was really crucial was research on radioactivity and later nuclear physics, and Einstein didn't do any of this, as far as I know.</p>
<p>If you want to blame someone, blame:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pierre Becquerel for discovering radioactivity: "By May 1896, after other experiments involving non-phosphorescent uranium salts, he arrived at the correct explanation, namely that the penetrating radiation came from the uranium itself, without any need for excitation by an external energy source".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Marie and Pierre Curie for discovering and studying new radioactive elements like radium and polonium ; they shared the 1903 Nobel with Becquerel for work on radioactivity.  Marie died of cancer from doing experiments with these materials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ernest Rutherford for inventing the concept of half-life, and discovering that in radioactive decay one element would turn into another by emitting alpha and beta particles.  In 1917 Rutherford carried out the first "nuclear reaction": bombarding nitrogen with alpha particles and turning it into oxygen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otto Hahn for discovering nuclear fission in 1938 and Lise Meitner for figuring out what was going on: a nucleus of uranium bombarded with neutrons could split into two smaller nuclei, releasing a lot of energy and also more neutrons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Frédéric Joliot-Curie, the husband of Marie and Pierre's daughter, for letting the world know that this could create a chain reaction.   Leo Szilard actually came up with the idea in 1933, and in 1934 he patented the idea of a nuclear reactor.  But he was smart enough to keep quiet about it.   When Enrico Fermi (in New York) and Frédéric Joliot-Curie (in Paris) started doing experiments on nuclear fission, he tried to persuade them to not publish anything about the idea of a chain reaction, lest the Nazis become aware of it.    Fermi agreed to self-censor.   Joliot-Curie did not: he published an article in <em>Nature</em> saying that when a uranium atom split, it released more neutrons that it took to split that uranium atom!   The idea of a nuclear bomb was then apparent to any intelligent physicist.  Leo Szilard became so scared of the Nazis developing a bomb that in 1938 he decided to contact Roosevelt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Werner Heisenberg for agreeing to lead the Nazi atomic bomb project.   He later argued that he deliberately <em>slowed down</em> this project, and there's even some evidence for this, but people will argue endlessly about it, and Bohr broke off his friendship with Heisenberg over this issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fermi, Bohr and all the other physicists who joined the Manhattan Project - this is a very long list.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Einstein was a bit player in all this <em>except</em> that he went along with Szilard and wrote the letter to Roosevelt.   </p>
<p>The myth that <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>E</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>m</mi><msup><mi>c</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">E = mc^2</annotation></semantics></math></span><span aria-hidden="true" class="katex-html"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.05764em;">E</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mrel">=</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8141079999999999em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">m</span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal">c</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.8141079999999999em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> was the key to the atomic bomb came later.  It certainly <em>helped</em> people figure out things about fission, but the things I just listed helped <em>much</em> more.   Einstein was off thinking about other things while these people were paving the way for nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>I'd extend this to say that neither Becquerel, Marie and Pierre Curie, Hahn, Szilard, Fermi should be held responsible for the bomb, since none of them explictly pushed for their science to be developed into a weapon. Even people closer to the Manhattan project could be excused: as John reported, many of them were very scared the Nazis could get there first (a very reasonable doubt) and at that point game theoretic incentives start to play a role, so that for the Allies developing the bomb <em>was the only option</em>. Using it, maybe not that much, that's another problem.<br>
But yeah, I think these are extremely complex problems and putting blame on people is wrong, since it oversimplifies.<br>
The good thing to do was non-proliferation treaties. But it takes a lot of work to arrive to a point where that's an option on the table. I don't think the 1930s were ready, and the bomb became inevitable.</p>

<p>I'll take the turn to place the obtuse part here. The US as a nation and especially the US military is left playing with its toys and pretending that it's important. There's still a real risk that it could throw a tantrum and hurt someone with its toys, but "US global power" isn't really a thing in this millennium.

<p>Yup, to me it's obviously the EU's <em>responsibility</em> to have troops on the ground in Latvia and Lithuania along the Russian borders. For deep political reasons that likely will never happen. (This is, by now, very far off topic from where this thread ought to get back to)</p>

<p>Consensus is becoming an increasingly difficult state to achieve with the changes to media.  There are many, powerful forces that are trying to achieve this disintegration of consensus.  American consensus is particularly under assault.</p>
<p>I know for sure, that there are many countries out there that would love for the broader global population to come to the consensus that there is no future in American global power.  I see this event as truly disastrous to a world that can be taken seriously or enjoyed thoroughly.</p>

<p>Also, the <em>really</em> bad thing that I would like to stop is abuse of military power, not the military funding ACT.  So the correct question is not "how can ACT people help keep the military out of ACT?"  It's "how can ACT people help stop abuse of military power?"  If you think that the latter question reduces to the former, that is something that can be argued, but it is not true <em>a priori</em>.  If you advocate rejecting military funding as a tactic, then I think the right question is "how effective is this tactic for stopping the abuse of military power?"</p>

<p>As far as I'm aware, military funding in Europe just isn't a thing. The UK is I think one of the more militaristic societies in Europe, and I've never heard of military research grants here. (What we do have here is huge industrial players like BAE and Lockheed, and they do fund research sometimes)</p>

<p>The idea that the concern is couched in terms of a universal removal of this support from all militaries is not a reasonable expectation.  That goes back to John's post about how Einstein sent the letter saying the Germans will get to the bomb first.  The other idea, that fundamental science goes straight and quick to the applications, is also untenable.</p>

<p>I understand American foreign policy and war/defense (whichever side you are on this argument) efforts is easy to criticize but that wasn't the point of the initial message. Would you say a European or Chinese researchers is okay to take military funding because that way they contrast the American global effort? This doesn't make sense morally</p>

<p>Okay, so you <em>are</em> thinking about these things!   Good!</p>
<p>I agree with you: European and especially Chinese researchers should think just as carefully about their involvement in the military as American ones.   I say "especially Chinese" because the possibility of a war between China and the US in the next few decades is a real one, whereas it seems less likely the EU will initiate a big war like that.  But it's probaby better for <em>everyone</em> to think about the consequences of taking military funding, not just cross their fingers and hope their country's military doesn't go to war.</p>

<p>In Engineering military funding is not going away – it's a lost cause there. But maybe math and CS are different. (Also my personal examinations of such things does not mean that I think it should be a prerequisite for being a researcher in any field, some people just don't care about politics AT ALL)</p>

<p>I'd extend this to say that neither Becquerel, Marie and Pierre Curie, Hahn, Szilard, Fermi should be held responsible for the bomb, since none of them explicitly pushed for their science to be developed into a weapon. </p>

<p>I agree about Becquerel and the Curies.  But Szilard was the one who came up with the idea of telling Roosevelt to start investigating the possibility of creating an atomic bomb: that was the start of the Manhattan Project.  And Fermi was one of the principal leaders of the Manhattan Project!  </p>
<p>So I think Szilard and Fermi very much have some responsibility for creating the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>This is not the same question as whether they did something evil.  That's a harder question.</p>
<p>To my mind the real evil in this vicinity was the US and British policy of winning the war by demolishing whole cities, killing vast numbers of innocent civilians.  </p>
<p>An early example was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Hamburg_in_World_War_II">bombing of Hamburg in July 1943</a> by US and British forces, which killed 37,000 civilians and wounded 180,000:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A thermal column of wind generated heat in excess of 1,400 degrees Fahrenheit, melting trolley windows and the asphalt in streets, the wind uprooting trees. When people crossed a street, their feet stuck in the melted asphalt; they tried to extricate themselves with their hands, only to find them stuck as well. They remained on all fours screaming. Small children lay like "fried eels" on the pavement. The firestorm sucked all the oxygen out of the city.</em> - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battle_of_Hamburg_(book)">Martin Middlebrook</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later came the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Dresden_in_World_War_II#On_the_ground">firebombing of Dresden in February 1945</a>, where they - or should I say "we"? - dropped 3,900 tons of bombs and incendiary devices on the city, leading to a firestorm that killed about 25,000 people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>We saw terrible things: cremated adults shrunk to the size of small children, pieces of arms and legs, dead people, whole families burnt to death, burning people ran to and fro, burnt coaches filled with civilian refugees, dead rescuers and soldiers, many were calling and looking for their children and families, and fire everywhere, everywhere fire, and all the time the hot wind of the firestorm threw people back into the burning houses they were trying to escape from.</em> — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Dresden_in_World_War_II#On_the_ground">Lothar Metzger, survivor</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then came the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Tokyo">bombing of Tokyo in March 1945</a>.   279 planes flew over the city and dropped 1,665 tons of bombs. Most were 500-pound cluster bombs, each one releasing 38 incendiary bomblets at an altitude of about 2000 feet. These bomblets punched through the roofs of people's houses or landed on the ground and ignited 3.5 seconds later, throwing out jets of flaming, sticky napalm.  Tokyo was a densely packed city, largely made of <em>paper</em>.</p>
<p>The planes also dropped 100-pound jelled-gasoline and white phosphorus bombs that ignited upon impact. The city's fire departments were overwhelmed, and the individual fires started by the bombs joined to create a huge conflagration that destroyed 16 square miles of the city. Over 100,000 people died — nobody knows how many, and both the Japanese and Americans had reasons to underestimate the casualties. </p>

Somewhere between 120,000 and 226,000 died.  Horrible!   But just the culmination of a horrible way of winning a war by treating civilians as worthless rats to be burnt.</p>

<p>The main reason I said all that stuff is that I've found a lot more people know about Hiroshima and Nagasaki than the bombings of  Hamburg, Dresden, and Tokyo.

<p>John has brought up the atrocities of the second world war with a bit of an emphasis on what terrible things the US and Britain did. Americans are the first to point out how American aggression and intervention is unjust. That very fact is why I believe that the ongoing soft and military powers of the US are welcome. Life has been very good for a lot of people for a long time, and where life is not good, the US and EU have been quick to condemn those countries.  There is no justification for scientists to pull out of the maintenance of this state of affairs.</p>

<p>Just to be clear, I was not bringing up those atrocities mainly to  say that the US and Britain are especially evil... I stay away from such broad judgements.  I was bringing up those atrocities to point out that the "atom bomb" was not a unique stand-alone sort of thing: it was part of a general strategy of bombing cities in such a way as to start massive fires.

<p>I've also just spent a lot of time reading about the history of 20th-century physics and the world wars, and how they interacted.   I consider myself mainly a mathematical physicist, so I've always been interested in this time period, where physicists made a big difference in world affairs, and Jewish scientists chased out of Germany helped build the bomb and jump-started physics in the US.    The glorious discoveries of quantum mechanics and relativity are mixed in quite inextricably with very dark, horrific events.</p>

<p>As for why the US military is a dominant channel for scientific funding, it's mainly because the US has a strategy of maintaining military dominance via technological superiority.  There are lots of documents about this; it's completely deliberate and explicit.   <a href="https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2020/05/the-united-states-spends-more-on-defense-than-the-next-10-countries-combined">The US spends more on the military than the next 10 countries combined</a>, and </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Annual spending on defense science and technology has “grown substantially” over the past four decades from $2.3 billion in FY1978 to $13.4 billion in FY2018 or by nearly 90% in constant dollars, according to a new report from the Congressional Research Service.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(from <a href="https://fas.org/blogs/secrecy/2018/02/defense-sci-tech/">here</a>).   For comparison, it looks like the National Science Foundation got <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/03/final-2018-budget-deal-should-help-national-science-foundation-2019-too">$7.767 billion</a> in 2018.</p>

<p>Something I'd like to see a bit more discussion on is the question about the difference between accepting funding from the US military and the US government. They have the same commander in chief, pretty much all the terrible things the US military does is because the government told them to do it, and as far as I understand it, the people in charge of giving funding can hop between doing this for the military and doing this for the government. Why then would it be morally acceptable to accept a government grant, but not a military grant?</p>
<p>I could see a difference when you would be actively cooperating with military personel, as then your knowledge is directly contributing to the military, but if the situation is like Bob's where it is basically a cash-only transfer, why would the difference matter?</p>

<p>The irony is that lobbying to divorce ostensibly non-military research from the military would improve the situation for both military and non-military research interests. At the risk of really kicking the heat in this discussion up a notch, I would compare this to the concept of defunding the police. The military is not a body fit for the responsibility of determining the entire scope of scientific research, and if it were relieved of that responsibility it could focus on funding the research that directly benefits the services it provides.</p>

<p>Sorry, I'm late to the conversation. A few considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fermi is absolutely responsible for the bomb. He was one of the leaders of the Manhattan project, he never regretted a thing about it, and he was actually also part of the team that evaluated which cities would make the best target for the bomb. He literally picked Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It's a slippery slope but it's difficult to make more mass murderer points than this if you are a scientist.</li>
<li>The US global power should really be curtailed (if only T_T). No offense but since 2001 US foreign policy didn't bring anything but problems, at least here in the EU.  I have been provocative about this many times, but I'll say it again: From an EU perspective, Trump was a blessing. Having the US without any real foreign policy for 4 years has been simply awesome for us. And I'm pretty sure that now that you have someone with a brain in power again, our relationships with Russia (that is our neighbour, btw) will just get much worse.</li>
<li>The US is still the global leader in the world. If you think nations like China are now in control you are being naive. There are many reasons for this, but the main ones are that the US have the biggest military in the world and much more importantly total control of the oceans, which are fundamental commercial routes.</li>
<li>I don't like rationalistic arguments like the ones <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="280784">@Joshua Meyers</span> was doing. I can understand that rationalism is very appealing for mathematicians, but it leads very easily to discard moral arguments, which in some cases are fundamental. The  result of applying a rationalist way of thinking in fields that should benefit also from a moral judgement can be seen in projects like effective altruism, which seem rationally sound but end up being just a discriminatory bollocks shitshow. With this I'm not saying that one shouldn't better motivate things, I'm just saying that analyzing moral-related issues like they were theorems can be dangerous.</li>

<p>Also, there are very rich people that want to do good, it's true. But I still think that the social cost of a billionaire defeats the possible benefits multiple times. Even people like Bill Gates, that donated a lot of their fortune to philantropic causes, have probably destroyed lives, careers, enterprises for a sum that was orders of magnitude higher than the one they donated. This is intrinsic to capitalism: To get that rich you have to engage in ruthless business practices, and more importantly actively fuel a system that is literally eating the planet away. And this is when you are a "good" billionaire. When you are a bad one you are just like Peter Thiel that has Moldbug and Land as his favourite ideologues, which says it all.</p>

<p>Sorry I don't really know what to do with this criticism.  Of course I agree that a purely rationalist way of thinking can be dangerous, but you haven't really shown me that that is happening here.

<p>I can give you a reason why this is so: The idea of thinking about solving issues in rational/game theoretic terms has been traditionally championed, for instance, by the realist school of international politics. Their idea was "The best way to decide how to act internationally is by interpreting the world like a sort of competitive game". This kind of school started with Bismarck, up until Kissinger, and there are still many people that think that way</p>

<p>The reason is that being "realist" gives you a very convenient argument for suspending moral judgement in service of some "greater good". The (obviously extreme) example of this may be the usual "If we kill all of our enemies, and show absolutely no mercy to anyone, then we will have peace."</p>

<p>Let me stress another important thing: No one, aside some truly mentally deranged people, does bad stuff while knowing that the stuff they are doing is bad. What I mean is that, more often than not, even the people doing the worst things one can imagine will think they were acting in good faith. <br>
For instance, and this is quite well documented, in a case of aggression between people you will see how both parties will say that they were acting defensively. "I stabbed him because he was punching me", "I punched him because he insulted me", "I insulted him because he was looking at me in a bad way", and so on. If you unpack any kind of violent behavior, you'll find out how most of the time both parties involved are convinced that they were acting in good faith, and were somehow justified</p>

<p>This is precisely why I do believe that moral reasoning must be central in discussing these issues. It really is something one has to constantly keep in check. "Am I acting morally here?" is the first question one should always ask himself, way before "Am I acting rationally?"

<p>Like it or not, if you want to be effective at doing <em>anything</em> you need to think about your strategy for doing it.  <em>A fortiori</em> if you want to be effective about doing something <em>good</em>.  I'm not claiming that this is sufficient, merely necessary.  You also have to think about what is good to do in the first place, as well as whether your strategy has harmful effects which outweigh the good of what it is a strategy for.</p>

<li>The US global power should really be curtailed (if only T_T). No offense but since 2001 US foreign policy didn't bring anything but problems, at least here in the EU.  I have been provocative about this many times, but I'll say it again: From an EU perspective, Trump was a blessing. Having the US without any real foreign policy for 4 years has been simply awesome for us. And I'm pretty sure that now that you have someone with a brain in power again, our relationships with Russia (that is our neighbour, btw) will just get much worse.</li>

<p>I tried looking up this idea that Eu-russia relations improved during Trump.  I only found an Economist article that suggested a thaw around 2019 but it was paywalled.</p>
<p>I don't believed the receding of US foreign policy improved EU-russia relations.  The reason is that I believe, instead, that they focused their attention on the personal manipulation they could achieve through social media.  This eventually led to the UK leaving the European Union.  That is an incredible win for Russia.  They dismantled the EU.</p>
<p>If American power were to recede, don't you feel that this would inevitably lead to the rise in China's power.  My country has just labeled them as effecting a genocide right now.  I am not sure you understand what that means to most people.</p>

<p>I have been trying to consider this idea that all scientists, globally, could just somehow agree to act highly ethically, say, for the next hundred years.  It is impossible.....but, let's just approach it from an idealized point of view.  How could it be achieved?  What would it mean on a personal level for Scientists?  How would they incorporate it into their work?  I mean, in just the simplest sense, there is already a whole branch of science which deals with ethical questions.  Take life science.  Is it really just a matter of not taking grants from the military?  That doesn't make sense, since once their work is published, technologists working for the military would find applications.  So that puts the burden on the scientist to mentally strangle themselves.</p>

<p>Personally, I think if scientists want to be "highly ethical for the next hundred years", they need to focus a lot of attention on the Anthropocene.   Global warming is the most obvious part of this, but it's really a <a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/balsillie/balsillie_what.pdf">much bigger thing</a>, and only with a lot of help from scientists will we get through this without a seriously damaged biosphere.   Of course politicians, and people in industry, and <em>everyone</em> has a crucial part to play, but at present only scientists can actually understand the many ways in which we are pushing up against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_boundaries">planetary boundaries</a> and <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-nine-tipping-points-that-could-be-triggered-by-climate-change">tipping points</a>, and only scientists have a chance of understanding the advantages and disadvantages of proposed solutions like geoengineering, carbon sequestration, fission and fusion power, solar and wind power, etc.</p>
<p>By the way, I'm not saying scientists should make the decisions: they should learn about the situation, evaluate solutions, and explain all this to everyone else!</p>

<p>It's much easier for scientists and mathematicians than ordinary folks to understand all the issues I just listed: we can read graphs (believe it or not, most people can't), we can read journal articles (most people don't even have access to them, much less know how to read them), we can sense what counts as crackpot science (well, many of us can), and so on.  So we all really have a duty to learn about these issues and educate our friends, neighbors, students and everyone about them.</p>

<p>It now takes 12M $ to train GPT-3 in electricity alone (!) so AI is heading for an ecological disaster.  We hope that our brand of AI which needs exponentially less resources can do something about that.  People in quantum computing are also working on carbon capture.</p>

<p>I do agree with John. And fields like data science and AI are really sensitive at the moment. For instance, a friend of mine working in AI told me in some AI-related fields it is becoming customary to make datasets and code available only to the reviewers, in fear that new advancements may be used by rogue actors (states or whatnot) to automate discrimination, persecution of political opponents and so on. So I'd definitely say that scientists have some very peculiar responsibilities, especially the ones working in some ethically sensitive fields.</p>

<p>No, not at this stage. But one day it may well be. We are still building the ACT fundamentals, but it's not unreasonable to think that one day the categorical approach will result in breakthroughs in various fields. This is already the case for quantum protocols, for instance. In such cases, some of the things we do may become problematic. It's good that we talk about these issues now that the community is still reasonably small, there aren't huge ethical implications in what we do (yet) and things are more or less under control. Hopefully, we will be able to understand and sort ethical issues now, so that when they will come we will be prepared (in truth I think you can never be prepared for this stuff, but giving it some thought helps anyway).</p>

<p>This looks like a really special feature of machine learning that it's possible to do this. It's quite a lot like showing someone your car but not giving them the key so they can't take it for a joyride (and technically they also can't know for certain that it's not broken down). Our field is way more conceptual, I can't imagine having an equivalent of "not giving them the key"</p>

<p>It's pretty hard for one's condemnation of military applications of one's research to have any impact if one is being directly paid by the military. Just like in any other mode of employment, if you are knowingly being paid to contribute to a problematic thing, you are directly complicit in the problematic thing. If your attitude is that the problematic thing will happen anyway so you might as well be complicit, that's a choice you can't possibly expect everyone to be on board with.</p>
<p>I tend to agree that only systematic changes will reduce the militaristic abuses of research, but that's no excuse for wilful participation in that abuse on an individual level (I guess this remark also applies to the other recent topic in this stream).</p>

<p>I take the position that doing research is not an endorsement of violent applications of said research unless one is personally profiting from those applications.

<p>The military pays a lot of people to do research that leads directly to new weapons and new software to organize the business of war.  And there are a fair number of applied category theorists doing just this.   I know them - and I was one myself, for a while.   (I was naive because they said the project would be about organizing search and rescue missions, which seemed harmless, but then the focus of the project shifted, and in retrospect I should have known from the start that this was a convenient cover story.)</p>

<p>In general, the military is not mainly paying people to do pure math that's useless to the military.   There are exceptions.  But they aren't a charity.</p>
<p>By the way, nothing in what I'm saying here presumes an answer to the question "should I be helping the military?"  People can make up their own minds about that.  And my point also applies to working for companies.   My point is that if someone is paying you to work for them, your work is probably helping them accomplish their goals, and you should think about that.</p>

<p>I have no direct knowledge of this particular instance but I am pretty sure that DARPA doesn't do "cover stories" for "6.1" (i.e., basic) research. They aren't liars. It was almost surely a bona fide application that was mindful of the sensitivities of those likely to contribute, but also very likely not the only one that DARPA had/have in mind.</p>

<p>Yeah, I didn't mean they "lied".    Maybe "cover story" has some very precise technical meaning that I didn't intend.  What I mean is that their original project, the one that I agreed to work on, which modeled saving sailors in a yacht competition in the Caribbean, segued smoothly into a second project that involved combat search and rescue.  This second project was sprung on me midstream.  And I quit.</p>

<p>Warfare is gonna be a thing as long as we're barely more than chimps. Mosaic warfare is gonna be a thing, and a thing that exploits compositionality one way or another, whether the engineers (or mathematicians) use category theory per se, knowingly, etc or not. It is also gonna be a thing that makes war less harmful to noncombatants--platforms and weapons will be smaller and individually less lethal, but more precise. Compare that with Grozny/Aleppo/Mariupol (or Tigray or Yemen etc.). Anyone who works in applying category theory (and Grothendieck's ghost) should come to terms with this stuff.</p>

<p>(He phrased it differently, as "whether you accept funding or not, and how you feel about that, is irrelevant".  But really, when you accept funding from X to do Y, you have to think about why X is willing to pay you to do Y.  Usually they have a reason.)</p>

<p>The idea that I'm a hypocrite for doing academic research is preposterous. I live in Europe. The funding for my work is not predicated on its potential usefulness to any military organisation, and I can be pretty confident that my career will not depend on the possibility eventual military applications.

<p>Communication is a necessary first step in any collective action, although I share your doubts that such will be the result of this discussion. On the other hand, you've already said that military applications are not worth worrying about, which I take to indicate that you wouldn't take an opportunity to obstruct such applications if you had it. If talk is cheap, a promise of inaction must be free.</p>

<p>Understanding how others might weigh up the consequences of that theft against the value stolen well enough to recognize that theft would be a likely outcome doesn't make me responsible for the theft. A prerequisite for any premeditated crime is the criminal's knowledge of the crime's possibility and a positive evaluation of the crime's value. I stand by standard legal practice in believing that it is the criminal that holds full responsibility for the crime, and not the victim.</p>

<p>This discussion is reminding me a bit of a thought I had recently, which is that we put way too high a value on being a hypocrite or not. If someone says "you are being a hypocrite!", then that is something you must immediately defend against, because that sure is a serious accusation. It almost feels like we would much rather have someone be a serial killer who is pure evil, rather than someone who is trying to do good, but sometimes doesn't, because that last person is a hypocrite.<br>
See for instance all those claims being made against Greta Thunberg, where if she does the merest thing that might be outputting CO2, people immediately try to discredit her using that. Or people trying to talk down vegans, because don't you know that soy is being farmed under unfair labour practices?</p>

<p>I guess what I'm trying to say is, there is no ethical consumption under capitalism. So everyone who doesn't go to live as a hermit in the woods is a hypocrite. So being a hypocrite is fine, as long as you try to live up to your principles.</p>

<p>The same applies to being "foolish", I think. Steve said earlier that "If you are foolish you are responsible for being foolish", but that strikes me as too simplistic.<br>
Behaviour judged to be foolish can be a result of a (perceived) failure of knowledge (ignorance) or a failure of reasoning. In either case, the accusation of foolishness contains the implication that the person <em>should</em> have known or reasoned better, and that obligation is the basis for assigning them responsibility for the consequences of their actions. But it's rarely possible to make such a judgement objectively, and it certainly isn't true that a person is always responsible for their own ignorance or inability to reason correctly. A bad teacher might hold their student responsible for failing to answer a question in class, but ultimately it is that teacher's responsibility to ensure that their student is equipped to answer those questions.</p>
<p>I maintain that being "foolish" doesn't make you responsible for the actions of others; at worst, it makes you vulnerable to them. If doing academic research while denouncing those who would apply my work to violent ends makes me a hypocrite or a fool to your eyes, so be it.</p>

<p>Sorry guys but I want to make a comment. Most of you seem to agree that :</p>
<p>(*) being funded by the military is bad. Because military are mean and want to kill people and they can use your research to develop themselves and kill more people. </p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>1) We don't know if the world would be less or more stable without the military, especially the military from the US. I agree with the fact that it's bad that people are killed by organized group of people with weapon, like national armies or terrorist organizations. I want to minimize the number of people who are killed by these organized group of people with weapon. I'm not convinced of what is the most efficient strategy for this but I'm ready to hear rigorous explanations.</p>
<p>2) It is much more scientifically established that the world will be less stable with a few more degrees in the average temperatures. By less stable, I mean in particular a world where there is more people who die by "unnatural causes" or suffer of various issues. It thus comes more easily to my mind to prioritize this point. I will not give you your best way of acting as it has been previously discussed in another thread.</p>
<p>3) I think that Grothendieck explained rightly how the world of math scholars suffer of some issues like people being more concerned by social recognition than acting rightly, in Récoltes et Semailles. I think that here, people are happy to agree on the proposition (*) because it is more or less widely accepted by their friends and it is always nice to feel part of a community who agree on similar things. It is not about social recognition but also more a social behavior than really something about morality even if I'm sure that you all want to act morally at the end.

<p>In my opinion, these three propositions are more or less true. I admit that I have not carefully read every message and that I'm not extremely subtle, but I can't not saying what I think. I'm ready to hear every constructive criticism but I don't think that we are going to make more progress than in the thread about conferences.

<p>Sorry guys but I want to make a comment. Most of you seem to agree that :</p>
<p>(*) being funded by the military is bad. Because military are mean and want to kill people and they can use your research to develop themselves and kill more people. </p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>1) We don't know if the world would be less or more stable without the military, especially the military from the US. I agree with the fact that it's bad that people are killed by organized group of people with weapon, like national armies or terrorist organizations. I want to minimize the number of people who are killed by these organized group of people with weapon. I'm not convinced of what is the most efficient strategy for this but I'm ready to hear rigorous explanations.</p>
<p>2) It is much more scientifically established that the world will be less stable with a few more degrees in the average temperatures. By less stable, I mean in particular a world where there is more people who die by "unnatural causes" or suffer of various issues. It thus comes more easily to my mind to prioritize this point. I will not give you your best way of acting as it has been previously discussed in another thread.</p>
<p>3) I think that Grothendieck explained rightly how the world of math scholars suffer of some issues like people being more concerned by social recognition than acting rightly, in Récoltes et Semailles. I think that here, people are happy to agree on the proposition (*) because it is more or less widely accepted by their friends and it is always nice to feel part of a community who agree on similar things. It is not about social recognition but also more a social behavior than really something about morality even if I'm sure that you all want to act morally at the end. Grothendieck didn't agree with this because he was strongly against funding by military but he got the point of (social aspects) &gt; (real morality) for mathematicians I think. </p>
<p>In my opinion, these three propositions are more or less true. I admit that I have not carefully read every message and that I'm not extremely subtle, but I can't not saying what I think.

Thus, I'm not sure that I really want to discuss more this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I think to me, and to many other people, it doesn't matter if the military is good, actually. You still don't want to work with them. Let me try to explain with an analogy: a doctor might be able to save 10 people, by killing one and harvesting their organs. In a utlitarian sense this might be a good thing to do. But I think it is very reasonable if the doctor doesn't want to do this. Someone could ask, but why, don't you want to save all those other people? And I don't think the doctor has to give any other explanation than "I don't want to, it feels icky".<br>
That to me is how working for the military would feel.<br>
Now, maybe it is good that there are other people that don't have this feeling of ickyness, and they can explain why it is perfectly fine. But to me that still probably wouldn't convince me.</p>

<p>No one in this discussion has advocated for the dissolution of the military, at least not openly, so I don't think this line of reasoning is relevant. On the other hand, if it comes to a simple choice between working with the military or not, it's pretty clear that 'not' would have a lower expected contribution to military output.</p>

<p>It was discussed in another thread because it is again not relevant to the present discussion. There are many ethical issues that one must confront in the world, but arguing against the discussion of one because there are other issues to discuss is rarely constructive, unless the discussion itself is causing a significant reduction in action on other issues.</p>

<p>Is your point that having this discussion is just our way of social signalling, that it's unlikely to actually impact anyone's behaviour, and that as a result the discussion is a waste of time? Or is it something else?</p>

<p>Hmmm... I'm not sure that this argument promoting individuals carries the weight you think it does. The military and the individuals comprising it do great things on a regular basis. John mentioned participating in a project aimed at search and rescue missions, for instance. The problem lies in the fact that the military doesn't share a moral baseline with me. Violence in its various forms is an acceptable means to an end for the military, whereas it is not for myself and several other participants in this discussion. For me, being a decent person in my day-to-day life wouldn't excuse voluntary participation in military violence.</p>

<p>My point is that this discussion is very one-sided. It woud be more interesting if there were military explaining more what their job consist in. I see this is as people who discuss but already agree together on an assumption which is maybe false: military have a bad effect on the world. I know you discuss precisely the point of accepting or not to be funded by military but it is pretty much equivalent to the question of what is really the effect of military on the world. Because you just want to defend or not an organization if it is a bad one or a good one basically. And I think, it is not so simple. Military are simply not that bad I think. At least it would be interesting to try to understand this question better.</p>

If you think for example that a large majority of military officers and noncommissioned officers in the US (and especially senior ones) are not animated by a deep and abiding sense of honor then you should get to know some of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmmm... I'm not sure that this argument promoting individuals carries the weight you think it does. The military and the individuals comprising it do great things on a regular basis. John mentioned participating in a project aimed at search and rescue missions, for instance. The problem lies in the fact that the military doesn't share a moral baseline with me. Violence in its various forms is an acceptable means to an end for the military, whereas it is not for myself and several other participants in this discussion. For me, being a decent person in my day-to-day life wouldn't excuse voluntary participation in military violence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But military are way more reasonable about violence that what you think. It is only the ultimate solution. If there is a terrorist organization who has no problem about being extremely violent, you can't respond with just words. It is necessary to be able to act on the physical level and simply kill people if it's the only solution to defend yourself. But this is just the last option, when all the other failed, and military think like this in fact.</p>

<p>The first question is a practical one, the second is a philosophical one. There's nothing wrong with a one-sided practical conversation, it just means that people are broadly in agreement about what course of action to take and are hashing out the details. Of course that would make for a very un-interesting philosophical debate, if that's what your after. </p>
<p>Maybe the crux of your disagreement with a few people here boils down to the fact that you're trying to play a devil's advocate in a philosophical discussion, while they're engaged in a practical one?</p>

<p>Yes, you're right. I find the philisophical question more interesting that the practical one. For me, it's the most important one. It's not very interesting to discuss if we must accept or not being funded by military before knowing if we want to be with or against them.</p>

<p>Where do folks draw the line between getting (US) funding from DoD and NSF? Do y'all think they don't cross-pollinate with money and jobs? I personally was acquainted with a NSA mathematician who went on to NSF, and in government funding discussions where DoD vs NSF buckets of money were a prominent topic. From my experience drawing any line would be a pretty arbitrary exercise.</p>

<p>Read the back end of this discussion and in my opinion this discussion boils down to the moral of a situation where someone shows the peace sign or tries to appeal to emotions to someone with a gun pointing at him.My interpretation - If the person with the gun has empathy (or empathy greater than their want of their set goals) you <em>might</em> win,if s/he doesn't you won't.</p>
<p>We all want to live in peaceful times where quality of life is distributed along a distribution with the maximum possible variance so violence seems to reduce that variance (just a metaphor,not doing the math of the impact of a changing number of people if that occurs),but not wanting to defend yourself or be defended out of platonic morals (which I sincerely hope will be concrete some day)  is bad according to camp <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="277578">@Steve Huntsman</span>  and good according to everyone else.</p>

<p>Again, the argument here has seldom been for the complete dissolution of any given military organisation (although there may well be people who would argue for that).

<p>Where do folks draw the line between getting (US) funding from DoD and NSF? Do y'all think they don't cross-pollinate with money and jobs? I personally was acquainted with a NSA mathematician who went on to NSF, and in government funding discussions where DoD vs NSF buckets of money were a prominent topic. From my experience drawing any line would be a pretty arbitrary exercise.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This question turned out to be a lot more interesting than I expected. I'm quoting from <a href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title42/chapter16&amp;edition=prelim">here</a>. When the NSF was founded in 1950, its directives were as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>§1862. Functions<br>
(a) Initiation and support of studies and programs; scholarships; current register of scientific and engineering personnel<br>
The Foundation is authorized and directed—<br>
(1) to initiate and support basic scientific research and programs to strengthen scientific research potential and science education programs at all levels in the mathematical, physical, medical, biological, social, and other sciences, and to initiate and support research fundamental to the engineering process and programs to strengthen engineering research potential and engineering education programs at all levels in the various fields of engineering, by making contracts or other arrangements (including grants, loans, and other forms of assistance) to support such scientific, engineering, and educational activities and to appraise the impact of research upon industrial development and upon the general welfare;<br>
(2) to award, as provided in section 1869 of this title, scholarships and graduate fellowships for study and research in the sciences or in engineering;<br>
(3) to foster the interchange of scientific and engineering information among scientists and engineers in the United States and foreign countries;<br>
(4) to foster and support the development and use of computer and other scientific and engineering methods and technologies, primarily for research and education in the sciences and engineering;<br>
(5) to evaluate the status and needs of the various sciences and fields of engineering as evidenced by programs, projects, and studies undertaken by agencies of the Federal Government, by individuals, and by public and private research groups, employing by grant or contract such consulting services as it may deem necessary for the purpose of such evaluations; and to take into consideration the results of such evaluations in correlating the research and educational programs undertaken or supported by the Foundation with programs, projects, and studies undertaken by agencies of the Federal Government, by individuals, and by public and private research groups;<br>
(6) to provide a central clearinghouse for the collection, interpretation, and analysis of data on scientific and engineering resources and to provide a source of information for policy formulation by other agencies of the Federal Government;<br>
(7) to initiate and maintain a program for the determination of the total amount of money for scientific and engineering research, including money allocated for the construction of the facilities wherein such research is conducted, received by each educational institution and appropriate nonprofit organization in the United States, by grant, contract, or other arrangement from agencies of the Federal Government, and to report annually thereon to the President and the Congress; and<br>
(8) to take a leading role in fostering and supporting research and education activities to improve the security of networked information systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, while interacting with other organisations, this was designed to be a foundation for direct support of science research, without particular prejudice regarding its applications.</p>
<p>However, in the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 2010, quoted on the NSF website, a "broader impacts review criterion" has been added to projects supported by the foundation which evaluates the following points:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>§1862p–14. Broader Impacts Review Criterion<br>
(a) Goals<br>
The Foundation shall apply a broader impacts review criterion to identify and demonstrate project support of the following goals:<br>
(1) Increasing the economic competitiveness of the United States.<br>
(2) Advancing of the health and welfare of the American public.<br>
(3) Supporting the national defense of the United States.<br>
(4) Enhancing partnerships between academia and industry in the United States.<br>
(5) Developing an American STEM workforce that is globally competitive through improved pre-kindergarten through grade 12 STEM education and teacher development, and improved undergraduate STEM education and instruction.<br>
(6) Improving public scientific literacy and engagement with science and technology in the United States.<br>
(7) Expanding participation of women and individuals from underrepresented groups in STEM.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In particular, point (3) makes it somewhat easier (hard for me to judge how much) for projects related to national defense to get funding.</p>
<p>Ultimately, any national funding has a budget and some of its priorities determined by the government and lawmakers of that country. If I were in the US and faced with the choice between DoD funding and NSF funding, it's still pretty clear to me that the latter would be preferable, since I can aim to get my research funded in support of points (2), (6) and (7) of the criteria above (for example), while avoiding reliance on my work's value with respect to the other criteria.</p>
<p>The fact that people pass between these sources of funding is irrelevant. The line exists to the extent that funding decisions are taken independently by the two organisations.</p>

<p>You and your grant application are not the sole or even primary determinant of your work's value with respect to the other criteria. But again I understand (correct me if I'm mistaken) that you disclaim any responsibility for how your work is used by others.</p>
<p>Re: funding, the personal experience I keep coming back to was one where DoD effectively exercised a right of first refusal on 6.1/basic research--the folks they'd been funding were top-notch (among that small set was a future Nobelist and a future MacArthur winner) and were going to continue to get funded be someone either way. So DoD said "let NSF start planting seeds from their bucket instead of us" with the intent of seeing what worked and what didn't. That NSF money was still advancing DoD's goals in accordance with DoD's plans.</p>

<p>I can't think of a more polite way to phrase it: this statement of yours is ignorant and betrays your moral bankruptcy. The report enables Russian war crimes by, <em>inter alia,</em> discouraging the provision of weapons by the West, which in turn costs innocent lives at the hands of criminals masquerading as an army that deliberately target civilians at the highest levels.</p>

<p>Tell me again where the double standard is. The US military mostly owns up to its institutional mistakes (and eventually all of them once they come to light) and always owns up to the crimes of its soldiers: I dare you to name one instance where it hasn't, or one organization that does better in this regard. Amnesty dodges its responsibility and pretends to be virtuous while blaming victims that it professes to help.</p>

They have good people working for them, and some bad actors, who should be forced out in shame, or if necessary court-martialed. Members of the US military have done evil: they should be prosecuted.

<p>I will double down on my statement: this position is morally bankrupt because it is simply false, and everyone participating in this discussion has the critical faculties and access to information to understand world events, the nature of large groups of humans, and the actual necessity for defense.

<p>I do think that some of the sweeping criticism made here of the “US military” looks more like generic criticism of the “US foreign policy complex” which is a strict superset of the military. My outsider impression is that the DoD component of this tends to be both more cautious and more accountable than most (probably because of “skin in the game”). If there is an organisation that should be called “evil” and has been overall pernicious on a global level, that should rather be the CIA, which is autonomous.</p>
<p>(I got the impression that there are hints of a similar pattern on the Russian side too, where the military was privately concerned about the invasion, but Putin surrounded himself with boasting and sycophantic intelligence officers instead).</p>

<p>First of all because many of us get into mathematics precisely because we value creativity and the exploration of the full space of possibilities, and find it ludicrous to suggest that a certain global state of affairs that has developed in the last few decades is somehow the “only realistic one” and some kind of inevitable consequence of “human nature”.</p>

<p>Many of us idolise Grothendieck in particular who was a “naive idealist” if there ever was one. His “naive” approach to mathematics certainly got impressive results. Of course success in politics and society follows different routes but it's not like “naive” questions about the social order -- e.g. “do we really need to have a hierarchy of kings, queens, and aristocrats?” -- have not ever led to global movements.</p>

<p>That's interesting because I would consider von Neumann much more of the same sort as Grothendieck, even though their approaches put them on opposite sides of the spectrum: he was also a very proactive idealist advocating for “creative” solutions, just one who considered the Soviet Union a unique threat to world freedom that warranted “dirty” methods.</p>

<p>Well I named my oldest kid after Kolmogorov but not sure I view his sort of Taoist approach there as relevant here, or that characterization of von Neumann above as fully representative. I view (and I think von Neumann also viewed, but correct me please) the US as a uniquely benevolent (yes there are counterexamples, but consider any possible comparisons) great power in the context of history, and the best hope for ushering in a just and peaceful global society. Sort of an "arc of history bends toward justice" thing.</p>

<p><em>Von Neumann entered government service primarily because he felt that, if freedom and civilization were to survive, it would have to be because the United States would triumph over totalitarianism from Nazism, Fascism and Soviet Communism.

<p>Yes, but my point is that there is no “Grothendieck vs von Neumann argument”, in the sense that I don't think that anybody in the history of people has been torn between “going Grothendieck” or “going von Neumann”. They are both idealists who believed in radical freedom but fundamentally disagreed about the best route to that freedom. </p>
<p>Relatedly, while you may feel ideologically closer to von Neumann, I don't think you are trying to convince people here who are more “Grothendieckian” to switch to a “von Neumannian” worldview. Instead, you are talking to people who probably view the US military (or rather US foreign policy) negatively overall, and you are trying to argue that they should nevertheless work with it (and be tolerant towards those who are), because that's better than the alternatives (ranging from “helping worse actors” to “having no impact whatsoever”) and because you can work with good people and make a positive difference within the system. That looks to me like proposing a “Kolmogorovian” bargain.</p>

<p>this thread is by now way to long to be carefully read, so i apologize that i only skimmed it yet rush to comment. but i have been thinking about this all of my life.</p>
<p>we are looking for a general principle of responsibility of a scientist. we are scientists and we tacitly assume that the world is driven by general principles. while most physicists agree that the same laws are valid in all corners of the universe, fewer people believe that the same moral laws are valid in all corners of life. such people used to be called puritans.</p>
<p>when we blindly follow our cognitive drift to seek the causes of things, and reality does not comply, we end up with superstitions and obsessions. grothendieck stated a general principle, and followed it into silence. von neumann saw nazis in action early on, stated a general principle, and followed it into his honest devotion to war and to the arms race. he was so honest that he insisted on being among the soldiers close to the triton test. the most general general principle left to him in the end was pascal's wager on his deathbed.</p>
<p>the very concept of responsibility is based on the general principle that we can predict the consequences of our actions. jainism suggests that we are responsible for the deaths that we cause. to avoid stepping on any insects, jainists used to have their servants walk in front of them and clear the path with large brooms. how much death has been caused by having too many servants?</p>
<p>i grew up when the future was bright and lit by science. i hated doing math, but ended up doing it because my head sought general principles, and every single human relationship that i had collapsed because of that. which taught me to keep things apart. "we should be silent of what we cannot speak."</p>
<p>every organization is a group of people. there are bad people at your department, and there are good people at your department. there are good people at a religious university, and there are bad people. there are good people at NSA and there are bad people. </p>
<p>the greatest responsibility of a scientist, and the only one that we stand a chance to implement, is to keep an open mind and try to avoid prejudices.</p>

<p><em>[T]here are no men more ignoble or more foolish, no men whose actions are fraught with greater possibility of mischief to their country and to mankind, than those who exalt unrighteous peace as better than righteous war...</em></p>
<p><em>All this is so obvious that it ought not to be necessary to repeat it. Yet every man in active affairs, who also reads about the past, grows by bitter experience to realize that there are plenty of men, not only among those who mean ill, but among those who mean well, who are ready enough to praise what was done in the past, and yet are incapable of profiting by it when faced by the needs of the present. During our generation this seems to have been peculiarly the case among the men who have become obsessed with the idea of obtaining universal peace by some cheap patent panacea...</em></p>
<p><em>There are big and powerful nations which habitually commit, either upon other nations or upon sections of their own people, wrongs so outrageous as to justify even the most peaceful persons in going to war...Be it remembered that the peoples who suffered by these hideous massacres, who saw their women violated and their children tortured, were actually enjoying all the benefits of "disarmament." ...</em></p>
<p><em>Yet amiable but fatuous persons, with all these facts before their eyes, pass resolutions demanding universal arbitration for everything, and the disarmament of the free civilized powers and their abandonment of their armed forces; or else they write well-meaning, solemn little books, or pamphlets or editorials, and articles in magazines or newspapers...It is almost useless to attempt to argue with these well-intentioned persons, because they are suffering under an obsession and are not open to reason. They go wrong at the outset, for they lay all the emphasis on peace and none at all on righteousness. They are not all of them physically timid men; but they are usually men of soft life; and they rarely possess a high sense of honor...if the principles they now uphold are right, it means that it would have been better that Americans should never have achieved their independence, and better that, in 1861, they should have peacefully submitted to seeing their country split into half a dozen jangling confederacies and slavery made perpetual...</em></p>
<p><em>The chief trouble comes from the entire inability of these worthy people to understand that they are demanding things that are mutually incompatible when they demand peace at any price, and also justice and righteousness...</em></p>
<p><em>These persons would do no harm if they affected only themselves. Many of them are, in the ordinary relations of life, good citizens. They are exactly like the other good citizens who believe that enforced universal vegetarianism or anti-vaccination is the panacea for all ills. But in their particular case they are able to do harm because they affect our relations with foreign powers, so that other men pay the debt which they themselves have really incurred. It is the foolish, peace-at-any-price persons who try to persuade our people to make unwise and improper treaties, or to stop building up the navy. But if trouble comes and the treaties are repudiated, or there is a demand for armed intervention, it is not these people who will pay anything; they will stay at home in safety, and leave brave men to pay in blood, and honest men to pay in shame, for their folly.</em></p>

<p>Perhaps there are hard-line pacifists here but I'm not sure the main line of debate is that one. I could agree with the core message of this except but reject that righteousness is about the “righteous nations” prevailing over the “unrighteous nations”, and indeed an “orthogonal” view of what is a righteous war is a basic left-wing tenet: embrace peace between the oppressed of all nations and war against the oppressors of all nations.</p>
<p>To keep it more concrete, I don't think that the “righteous” way to stick it to Putin is to make sure that as many 18-year-olds from Siberian villages as possible are blown to pieces, any more than I think that Steve deserves to die on the way to punishing George W. Bush for his war crimes.</p>

<p>Perhaps I am projecting my own views on other people. For me the issue of developing weapons <em>for a particular state actor, which will keep the results to itself, in order to improve their standing over other state actors</em> is fundamental, more than the one of “helping develop weapons” in general (which is somewhat outside one's control).</p>

<p>I just looked back at my contributions to this conversation, and I was surprised at how consistent my position has been. If I have or were to "rake you over coals", it would be for continually failing to explain why anyone here who doesn't share your pride in a military organisation should voluntarily contribute to one? You've adequately argued that the military is a 'necessary evil' (just coining a phrase, please don't read too much into it) and that any research we produce that is deemed potentially useful by the military will be exploited. Fine. But you haven't justified why a mathematician who is not interested in (or may even be resentful of) military applications should <em>have to</em> get their funding through a military funnel.<br>
It's my position that fundamental/basic research should be funded independently of military decision-making and interests. As an early career mathematician, the only agency I have over that situation, besides making somewhat public statements such as this, is to refuse or avoid military funding wherever possible, and I think the same goes for anyone else in my position. That's why I believe this is The Responsibility of the Scientist Today, not because I'm actively opposing the military, but because military interests are not the same as the interests of science.</p>

<p>Ok, I’ll take this one head on and without reference to the surrounding context. The answer is utility. There are reasons why DARPA makes breakthroughs that NSF doesn’t—often breakthroughs that help the whole world. They take risks that NSF never will. They focus on real problems that NSF never will. They deploy money more coherently in focused period than NSF ever will. Their measure of success is utility, not publications. If you want your research to mean anything in the greater scheme, you should take military money. If you want to just be an artist and avoid work that would suggest a measure of responsibility, then remember that almost nobody on the planet will appreciate or understand what you do, and your life’s work will probably be trivial.</p>

<p>I have the impression that y’all take it as axiomatic that Afghanistan and Iraq were unmitigated calamities instead of calamities with silver linings, even big silver linings. I do not take it as axiomatic. I am not that well informed about them because I’ve spent my whole career being more preoccupied with China and Russia and the spheres they are trying to dominate.

<p>I live in Estonia, I have lived in Japan and I've travelled a bit, e.g. to Iran. I think the common factor is that... people have complex thoughts? They certainly don't see the US or any other actor as a monolith. </p>
<p>In any case I don't think that Estonia/Ukraine or Japan are very representative examples, considering they are neighbours in a tense relation with US rivals, so of course they'll accept the patronage of whoever can help. Most Estonians hailed the Nazi as liberators from Russians when they occupied the country in World War II.

<p>I should add that the sentiment that I've mostly heard expressed in private from Estonians is strongly positive towards the "concept" of NATO mutual defense, and at the same time strongly distrusting of the US's commitment (essentially people are convinced that if it comes to that, Americans will never actually want to sacrifice their own soldiers to protect the Baltics). Which is why a lot of Estonia's diplomatic moves are about pushing the US to make stronger and more concrete commitments so that they hopefully can't walk back without losing face.</p>

<p>you haven't justified why a mathematician who is not interested in (or may even be resentful of) military applications should <em>have to</em> get their funding through a military funnel.<br>
It's my position that fundamental/basic research should be funded independently of military decision-making and interests. As an early career mathematician, the only agency I have over that situation, besides making somewhat public statements such as this, is to refuse or avoid military funding wherever possible, and I think the same goes for anyone else in my position. That's why I believe this is The Responsibility of the Scientist Today, not because I'm actively opposing the military, but because military interests are not the same as the interests of science.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok, I’ll take this one head on and without reference to the surrounding context. The answer is utility. There are reasons why DARPA makes breakthroughs that NSF doesn’t—often breakthroughs that help the whole world. They take risks that NSF never will. They focus on real problems that NSF never will. They deploy money more coherently in focused period than NSF ever will. Their measure of success is utility, not publications. If you want your research to mean anything in the greater scheme, you should take military money. If you want to just be an artist and avoid work that would suggest a measure of responsibility, then remember that almost nobody on the planet will appreciate or understand what you do, and your life’s work will probably be trivial.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I personally judge the value of science on how much it advances understanding, be it at the cutting edge of research or in a classroom (it's "knowledge utility", if you like), rather than in its exploitability. I don't know how you could justify the risk-taking claims; surely funding fundamental research which lacks a direct pathway to practical payoff is a bigger financial "risk" than entrepreneurial funding of technological development.</p>
<p>But if I were to value practical utility/impact more highly, it still wouldn't justify taking military money. There are a vast number of applications of maths, and most of them have no obvious dependency on the military. Most notably for public benefit, one could seek applications to medicine, energy, transportation and logistics, communications... So I ask you again, why should I take money from the military? If your answer is that the US military funds projects in those domains too, then my question will instead be: why should that be the case?</p>

<p>I disagree totally in the real world. The military goals provided focus and will. NSF doesn't take big risks. And there are reasons why everyone keeps trying to duplicate DARPA (e.g., ARIA in the UK most recently) without the same level of success: e.g., lack of focus and will.</p>

<p>If DARPA is so great, why do basically all the professors I know avoid it like the plague? The story is that it is a high-overhead (e.g. lots of dog-and-pony show) source of money, and the funding is so unselective that it doesn't really count for your tenure case.</p>

<p>This sounds laughable. If you get enough money you get tenure. And you have no idea what you're talking about.

<p>Regarding the relationship between scientific goals and military goals, I too find it to be a bit idealistic/utopian to speak of the former as if they can be independent of the latter in imperialist society. (Of course, I agree that it is good to 'want' what you advocating!)</p>
<p>Ultimately everything boils down to the class struggle; if you are getting paid a lot of money to do something fun within an imperialist country (e.g. US, UK, EU, Russia, China, etc.), chances are that you won't like the ultimate reasons you are being paid to do this... Sometimes it is to literally make a weapon, but other times it is about developing and projecting 'soft power' that is not directly applied to weapons, but more has to do with the continued cutting-edge mathematical supremacy of (e.g.) the United States, etc.</p>

<p>I think its almost surely about expectations. If you show up as a fresh assistant prof to work on one thing and end up doing another the department will not view it favorably and the money had better not come with controversy or reputational risk unless it pays for a building. If you show up and work on what they hired you for and bring in money the world's your oyster.</p>

<p>I don't feel great about what's happened in SV in the last 15 years for sure. The third time Facebook tried to recruit me, I told them to never contact me again--they weren't looking for me to do purely basic research, and I didn't want to undermine democracy by doing anything else there for that creep Zuck. So no I won't claim that FAANG or MMAAA or whatever it is now are mostly driven by DoD priorities--clearly it's advertising and retail stuff along with a lot of cloud/services. But I also think the idea that they are making transformative technologies to the same degree as 25 years ago is a bit strained unless there's DoD money driving it. The iPhone is 15 years old (and Siri was literally a spinoff from a DARPA program). VR research on the other hand is still pushed by DoD (esp. the USAF) as much as anyone--like the $22B dumpster fire with Hololens. Self driving cars are a DARPA thing. </p>
<p>Impractical breakthroughs are easy. The Soviets had them in spades in places like Novosibirsk. But they never did much with any of the math they made.</p>

<p>Have you heard of the idea of the 'urn of inventions' from Nick Bostrom? He makes the point that the agenda of science, to blindly extract balls from this urn as rapidly as possible, is actually kind of insane.<br>
There doesn't seem to be any good reason to assume there are not 'black balls' in this urn that e.g. greatly empower individuals to cause massive ammounts of harm, and once extracted they cannot be put back.</p>

<p>I've been talking to the other moderators on this group, and we agree that this sort of threat - "Be careful that you don't approach me in real life either" - is completely unacceptable in this forum.

</blockquote>
<p>Let me elaborate. A bunch of people doing their own research individually without a common goal and competition among various teams to best achieve it leads to bad overall results even if there are islands of excellence. That is, the researchers are individually focused but collectively unfocused. They are not organized. They lack the will to subordinate themselves to a specific, measurable goal without (their lab supervisor's) money on the line. </p>
<p>Examples <em>par excellence</em> here are the various grand challenges that demonstrated autonomous driving (first wilderness, then urban) and hacking/patching; or the AlphaDogfight competition that had AI systems flying fighter jets literally fight to the (simulated) death. These are not basic research, but even in the programs I've PI'd or worked on there have been challenges and competition. Folks learn much more quickly what works and what doesn't because they have skin in the game.</p>
<p>The example I have cited was not DARPA, and it was not competitive--DoD had concluded that research was still too immature to be applied, and even too early to have different approaches compete. This is in fact why it was farmed out to NSF. The <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/heilmeier-catechism">Heilmeier catechism</a> is important to bear in mind here. </p>
<p>Your perspective on risk also I think misses the point. Say you want to make fusion work. Do you do inertial confinement, a tokamak, or something "crazy"? DARPA will try the crazy things if they appear to pass muster. Sometimes this results in bad science because a small group can made bad calls: e.g., <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Imaginary_Weapons/zZucnXnI0-QC?hl=en">a project to get energy from hafnium isomers</a> that some of my mentors at the Institute for Defense Analyses were bashing incessantly when I was there. Mostly it results in things that kind of work but don't get "transitioned." But DARPA measures the risk as: are we missing out on the ability to make something that isn't incremental? They specifically require that any research has the plausible prospect of revolutionary advances to the state of the art (whether or not that sparks a revolution beyond the art). NSF very much embraces the incremental.</p>

<p>If I became a DARPA PM (not outlandish, two folks I mentored are there currently and one of my best friends is former, besides probably a dozen others I am acquainted with) I would for instance explore "doing SysML with category theory," basically to accelerate and amplify the sort of stuff NIST has been poking around. So yeah this or something similar could actually happen, and even if I personally didn't become a PM. It is a small community and I have at times ranted to folks (including Paschkewitz) about various things. Many people have similar ideas and there is no monopoly on them.</p>

<p>I'll also mention that the PMs I've worked with have often provided invaluable technical guidance as well as sanity checks, exposure to applications and interested parties, and cross-pollination among teams.

<p>The "dog and pony" element that Jon Sterling referred to is necessary for the PM to provide that sort of value versus the much more passive ONR/AFOSR or still more passive NSF model. Academics probably hate it unless they are trying to spin off a company from their work, which I tried and which I've seen other folks I've worked with do more successfully. Those folks love it because they get use cases and actual results that they can show potential clients/investors/etc.</p>

<p>I think it depends a lot on the subject.  In math this individualistic approach seems to work quite well.   One could argue that math research would work better if it were more organized - but for a lot of topics, where brilliant weird new ideas are what we need most, I think the resulting increase in conformity would be bad.<br>
In any event, most mathematicians are used to working in teams of at most about 5: coauthorships.</p>
<p>For subjects that need big teams, like serious engineering projects, it's bound to be different.</p>
<p>Computerized theorem-proving like Lean is an interesting case.  HoTT also has some "big team" aspects.  The AlgebraicJulia project, which I'm somewhat involved with, also involves a lot more teamwork than anything I've done.</p>

<p>Absolutely. My own work is far less collaborative than any of my colleagues' is. But once you want to turn math into code things can get intricate quickly, as you remark in re: AlgebraicJulia. TDA had much the same feature.</p>

<p>Also I'll mention that formal methods of various sorts (theorem proving, model checking, SMT solving) have long been a DARPA I2O (information innovation office) mainstay and will continue to be. Lean and HoTT are both adjacent to this. This is in part why I'm surprised and even incredulous about Jon's remarks re: the attractiveness of DARPA funding. I've seen more than a few academics with very strong Coq (or occasionally something like ACL2) chops on proposals, including my own, and some but not all winning.</p>

<p>It might not be failing - but you can be damn sure anyone interested in it won't dare speak up in <em>this</em> conversation.  <span aria-label="upside down" class="emoji emoji-1f643" role="img" title="upside down">:upside_down:</span> </p>
<p>I sometimes wonder what people hope to achieve by "demonizing" military-funded work.   Personally I'm less interested in demonizing it than avoiding it, and developing new sources of funding.  For example, I'm hoping that work on compositional epidemiology helps get some applied category theory funded by the medical establishment.   I don't want this funding myself, but I want it to exist, and I wish the Topos Institute could get some.  I also want to get serious about applications connected to climate change.</p>
<p>It's possible the people who "demonize" military-funded work aren't really thinking strategically.  If you think something is terrible you just yell about it.    So far this isn't stopping the HoTT project, or David Spivak, or Bob Coecke, from getting lots of military funding - much of which gets disbursed to postdocs.    But the demonization certainly means that they won't talk about it here!   </p>
<p>So in a way, it tends to create a bubble, where people inside the bubble all agree military funding is evil, and are shocked to hear from anyone who disagrees... yet outside the bubble, military funding continues apace.</p>

<p>Let me elaborate. A bunch of people doing their own research individually without a common goal and competition among various teams to best achieve it leads to bad overall results even if there are islands of excellence. That is, the researchers are individually focused but collectively unfocused. They are not organized. They lack the will to subordinate themselves to a specific, measurable goal without (their lab supervisor's) money on the line. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your argument here is that bigger projects require greater organising structure? Fine. Nothing in the model you're talking about requires anything to do with the military, it just happens that this is a model that the US military is employing. You've taken every opportunity to advertise your employer's successes in funding research, but this doesn't address the issue of why the military should be involved. If the model is so successful, what's keeping it tied to the military?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DARPA will try the crazy things if they appear to pass muster. DARPA measures the risk as: are we missing out on the ability to make something that isn't incremental? They specifically require that any research has the plausible prospect of revolutionary advances to the state of the art (whether or not that sparks a revolution beyond the art). NSF very much embraces the incremental.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some progress is made incrementally, some is made through creative leaps. All this shows is what the NSF should be doing with its funding. It does not demonstrate that military ties are essential in any way to scientific funding.</p>

<p>My impression is that it's a combination of military necessity that the polity mostly buys into and the American talent for applied research/entrepreneurship. In large part the latter is due to the former. Just a guess.</p>
<p>If this stuff was easy, Alphabet's non-Google stuff would be raking in cash. DeepMind is crushing it but the ROI seems indirect to me (or channeled back into Google per se quietly). Bell Labs and Xerox PARC famously failed to exploit their innovations (the latter leaving the field to Apple on many occasions, where SRI has also notably intersected). But this stuff is harder than being a VC because you have to start sooner in the technology readiness level and still get a "product" to be successful.</p>

<p>You know, I'm reminded of an episode where I had an idea for a pure science ("6.1") DARPA BAA and had someone at a very fancy university interested before they claimed it wasn't possible for an administrative reason. I read between the lines and I am 95% sure a PhD student/postdoc objected to doing that sort of thing, whereupon the professor offered a polite excuse. So this can be a lesson to the youngsters: talk with prospective advisors about your red lines early--they and you will be better off for it.</p>

<p>of course. even if it could not be muted, noone is forcing me to read anything. a newspaper cannot be muted, but no one is forcing anyone to read it sequantially, and they don't.</p>
<p>the thread is not boring to me. on the contrary. </p>
<p>but the problem with a discussion that generates a flood of words is not personal, but social. one side is objecting against one kind of harmful reasoning, the other side against another kind of harmful reasoning. there is no reason why of two people who disagree either one has to be wrong, and either one has to be right. the reasoning are often in different subspaces, often perpendicular. there may be two parallel universes, where one side's view is pursued, and where the other side's view is pursued, and in both universes everyone is dead. or in both everyone is having fun. there is no reason why either side has to be right. in most wars, both adversaries commit some terrible things. (it is easier to see that on older wars than on newer.)</p>
<p>there are many families and friendships with deep disagreements. bob thinks in pictures and alice thinks in words, and alice is obviously blind to many things that bob sees, and bob is deaf to many things that alice says. but empirically, most families do not spend time arguing such issues. we don't push our children to our standpoints, or to re-educate our parents, because we know that some conversations are impossible. words don't work for everything.</p>
<p>but when it comes to discussing really BIG complicated things, then we feel the need to convert the other side, because they are so deeply wrong. and we will do it by producing lots of words. we didn't try convince our parents that bacon is disgusting, or that parking close to the garage door will not cause fire, but we feel a need to convince a network community that funding by Google causes less harm than funding by AFRL, or vv.</p>
<p>a history of trying and failing to communicate made people produce many different languages. body language expresses some things words don't. math expresses some things words don't. no one could play a basketball match if they had to make plans in words. they coordinate in body language. here there are lots of people who are good at things expressed in math. it is useful to think a bit about what kind of messages stand a chance of being transferred in which narratives.</p>

<p>Following your advice I did read up on it. DARPA tested and evaluated Agent Orange. But, contrary to your claim, DARPA research did not create it: the agent was used by the British in Malaya in the fifties for the same purpose (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_AGILE#Subproject_VI">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_AGILE#Subproject_VI</a>). </p>
<p>DARPA's T&amp;E work was conducted in the early-to-mid sixties, during a time when the component (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic_acid">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic_acid</a>) that was contaminated with dioxin was allowed for use even in American agriculture until 1970. This suggests to me an instance of Hanlon's razor, viz. "never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity." I can only speak for myself here: had I been involved in this test/eval work and known of the dangers (and I assume I would not be so incompetent not to have been, as the dioxin contamination issue was apparently known before the sixties), I would have urged that the chemical not be used. I suggest that having competent people involved in DARPA research is important precisely because of its gravity, and that discouraging folks from participating is perhaps counterproductive to your stated goals in an instance such as this.</p>
<p>As far as Predator drones are concerned, we are all aware of tragic mistakes in targeting, and we all deplore them (I view them as necessary evils; you and others merely as evils). </p>
<p>But I submit to you that a recent example of drones in this regard is a model of how technological development keeps people safer. Ayman al-Zawahiri was killed by a drone strike using a Hellfire R9X missile, which has no warhead: instead, it "just" deploys blades and cuts through a single target. (<a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2022/08/03/ayman-al-zawahiri-s-death-what-is-the-hellfire-r9x-missile-that-the-americans-purportedly-used_5992310_4.html">https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2022/08/03/ayman-al-zawahiri-s-death-what-is-the-hellfire-r9x-missile-that-the-americans-purportedly-used_5992310_4.html</a>) Though al-Zawahiri's family was in the same house as him, there appear to have been no collateral victims. As technology improves <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_and_control#Derivative_terms">C4ISR</a> and other warfighting elements, the harm to noncombatants decreases. This is a trend throughout history, and is something to be welcomed: if wars must be fought (and we will disagree on this), then civilian harm should be minimized (<a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3140007/civilian-harm-mitigation-and-response-action-plan-fact-sheet/">DoD is making admirable efforts in this regard</a>).</p>
<p>If you will argue that the US targeting the leader of al-Qaeda in a drone strike that killed him alone is in any way wrong, then I have nothing further to say to you on the topic.</p>

<p>Reading a bit more, it turns out that the US Department of Agriculture was tasked to perform secondary evaluations of herbicide candidates after the US Army chem/bio folks performed initial evaluations: see p. 144 of <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/AD0338491">https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/AD0338491</a>. ARPA's principal role appears to have been to be "on the loop" here while focusing on developing spraying systems (see p. 143). So perhaps you should take issue with the USDA, not least since DARPA's direct involvement with bioscience only began in 2001 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_Technologies_Office_(DARPA)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_Technologies_Office_(DARPA)</a>) and helped with mRNA vaccines, prostheses, and trauma care among other things.</p>

<p>I think there's a big difference in who these events should be considered to represent. From an outsider's perspective the ACT conference was set up by the ACT research community, so is probably a good indicator of the values of a majority of people in that community. </p>
<p>On the other hand I would expect a workshop run by a US govt organisation to be representative merely of the US government's values.</p>

<p>Yes.  In particular, Spencer Breiner and Eswaran Subrahmian at NIST are trying to set up a consortium of companies that support research in applied category theory, including Chevron and others, and this meeting at NIST is part of that effort.</p>

<p>I kind of danced around my point above. But what I meant was that as someone doing research in ACT I would feel much more responsibility for the image of the ACT conference, than for a NIST workshop, because it directly reflects on a community which I choose to be part of.</p>

<p>Wow a lot to address...I'll go in order. Please provide some data to support your assertions instead of an opinion piece. I get that you loathe the Pax Americana, and that it is easy to find sympathizers in your milieu and among media that you consume. But I prefer quantitative data and facts to ideology. If you can provide either of the former (I have challenge you on this point before, you may recall) I'll accept them seriously and with intellectual honesty/humility.</p>
<p>The US bombed Europe quite a bit not that much longer ago than 1954, which is the most salient date in your recent comments (I'll get to that). The US also bombed the former Yugoslavia quite a bit in the nineties--but I get that Serbia doesn't like the US. Anyway having spent three weeks in Montenegro about a decade ago I can personally attest that their neighbors like the US quite a bit, and I think even you would have a hard time arguing with a straight face against that whole episode.</p>

<p>Now I actually do subscribe to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32iCWzpDpKs">the Team America speech</a> [warning: not in good taste, and not for the faint of heart]. To the extent the Pax Americana supports the free movement of ideas, people, and goods, I think it is a good thing. To the extent that it does not, it is dubious at best and misguided. The example of Guatemala in 1954 that you cite (or others wherein the US made Latin America safe for the United Fruit Company and its ilk, or Iran safe for oil interests) placed goods above people, which is and was a mistake. I also won't act like the Monroe Doctrine is something that should apply in the 20th or 21st centuries. So score that one for you, I guess, if you think that my position is blind support of whatever the US does. But this is not my position and trying to characterize it that way is easily refuted by statements that I've previously made here.</p>

<p>But yes I understand that Guatemala has had a rough go of it. I don't know much about it either. But (since you seem fond of opinions, assertions, and anecdotes in lieu of broader facts) the only person of Guatemalan descent that I've ever known reasonably well is a first-generation American who--wait for it--I recruited to work on a DARPA effort in 2008 (as she was spending a year in Guatemala) and continues in the defense R&amp;D arena to this day.

<p>I am not proud of many of the US's actions. I protest against my government fairly regularly in fact, and quite a bit during calendar years 2017-2020.

<p>The word "bully" is just wrong here: "publicly browbeating" would be correct though. Bullying implies a power dynamic that plainly isn't in evidence. If anything, I've been at a power disadvantage relative to Jules on at least two occasions: first, in 2020, when I was unable to directly respond because I could not speak on behalf of my employer, and this was inextricably bound up with the discussion; and second, as I submitted something to ACT 2022. (In fact I submitted there versus a venue I've had three papers at largely <em>because</em> I had reason to think my paper would get rejected for reasons other than the merits, and I must say I was impressed that it wasn't. So kudos to the PC, FWIW.) I have no power over Jules and very little (less than most if not all of my interlocutors) in the part of this community that doesn't work with the US military.</p>
<p>That said, I admit that I could have simply showed the existence of a green dot or merely asserted its appearance, and what I did was less graceful than that. So I apologize for this minor variation in form--but not for any substance.</p>

<p>This isn't childish at all. It is about violence and our role in it. There could hardly be anything more adult. Unseemly, sure. But as far as politeness has gone I place my actions far higher up the Emily Post scale than trying to cancel someone for an implicit mainstream political opinion.

<p>My day job as a retiree is preparing for a <a href="https://www.proutinstitute.org/">post-capitalistic</a> world and connects with having spent years as a yogic monk. Many people know me as Prashanta which means dynamic peace - a deep part of my identity is to protect people and the Earth as a whole. I have worked with violent developmentally disabled people where I constantly had to intercede to protect people including using my body as a shield for others. The most important part of the job was being able to turn the other cheek and not retaliate when hit. And I have also had very close ties to the military and government.   </p>
<p>As someone who had been a yogic monk for years, I entered the US Air Force in 1978. A major part of this message is the importance of diverse people connecting up. In basic training  I meditated at the end of the day. At the end of basic there where half a dozen of up meditating at night.</p>
<p>I ended up with AFTAC which monitors the nuclear test ban treaty - it also has deep ties to DARPA. At least in the eighties AFTAC was a world class scientific institution. Our geophysical division was decades ahead of the rest of the scientific establishment. As a young man it transformed my life working with so many elite people and projects. Not just intellectually, many people had great honor and civic commitment. I have many good memories of AFTAC.</p>
<p>As a computer developer I have worked for the State Department on multiple projects. Very politically and intellectually sophisticated people. Some institutes are together, some are a mess. All inside beltway reality.</p>
<p>I don't accept Grothendieck's answer to the existence of the military. Even out bodies had immune systems. Things get better when people come together. I've become good friends with surprising people - as should be. The Air Force and the government accepted me for who I was and even gave me a Top Secret clearance. Just like the rest of reality, there are exceptional parts and those which are not. Just be resolute in your beliefs and you will change your surroundings for the better wherever you are.</p>

<p>It's the simple cartesian vs non-cartesian point of view.  Lawvere developed much of his category theory from a Leninist point of view.  But that was a very Cartesian point of view.

<p>Maybe he is talking about cartesian categories vs monoidal  categories. Cartesian categories are classical physics, related to calculus (eg. differential lambda calculus), a notion of truth (intuitionnist logic) and infinity (because you can copy indefinitely data from one object). Monoidal categories are quantum mechanics, they are more about processes and discreetness. The two can be reconciled by the exponential modality of linear logic which gives a Cartesian (closed) category as the coKleisli category of a comonad on a Monoidal (closed) category. As such one can even view linear logic as an adjunction between a linear (the second one) and a non-linear (the first one) category. But the most important one is really the linear one ie. the monoidal category. Cartesian categories and intuitionnistic logic have a more “theological” flavour than Monoidal categories and the linear part of linear logic because it comes from ideas about eternal truth and infinity which can cause damage into our finite world eg. think to global warming.</p>

<p>Yes, I think this is a very nice explanation about the dangers of "cartesian thinking", meaning "thinking the universe is like a cartesian category".   I like to say that a cartesian category is like an office where all you deal with is documents and you have a perfect copying machine and a perfect waste basket, so you can duplicate and throw out documents to your heart's content and never run out of money, or ink, or space in your waste basket.</p>

<p>Sure, we now live in a world where people freely pollute and create trash, and governments freely create money to keep an "ideal" amount of inflation, to encourage consumer spending. In a sense, the rejection of linearity (in the sense of linear logic) by the powers and forces that be in a modern society? </p>
<p>What does this have to do with a "Leninist perspective" of Lawvere? Is Leninism inherently Cartesian?  </p>
<p>Also, I suspect Lawvere might have countered that the human mind and the thoughts that inhabit it are a part of nature just as much as flowers, rocks, and stars. Just that we have to keep in mind (heh) the separation between concrete and abstract categories.</p>

<p>It's not even fake, just bloody boring.  :)  And indeed, most stuff in the world is simply not Cartesian, from a process-theoretic point of view.  The reason the old generation went full-on Cartesian was because of the universal property obsession.  But for me, compact closure is actually also like a property.  The maths isn't entirely in place yet for this, but here are the intuitions:  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00708">https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00708</a></p>

<p>[SPOILER?]<br>
I saw it and without exaggerating it is one of the worst and most boring movies I've ever seen. And I do actually like some other films from Nolan (Inception, Interstellar). I am totally confused why it is getting good reviews. Beyond being boring as shit, the most egregious point is it barely acknowledges the horrific violence against Japanese civilians- the main moral dilemma is about Oppenheimer having his security clearance revoked or something? 0/5 <span aria-label="star" class="emoji emoji-2b50" role="img" title="star">:star:</span></p>
