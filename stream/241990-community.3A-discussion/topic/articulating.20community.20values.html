<p>Some of you might have noticed there's a scheduled section on Community Values at ACT 2020: <a href="http://act2020.mit.edu">http://act2020.mit.edu</a>. (It's the first hour of Session 2: 1600 UTC on Thursday July 9th.) This was catalysed by recent events, and a realisation that as this community grows, we necessarily make shared decisions that relate to our values, such as around inclusivity efforts, invited speakers, and conference fees and funding. </p>
<p>As organisers of this year's ACT, we thought it'd be a useful community exercise to begin a dialogue to articulate these values, and perhaps ultimately produce a living, evolving, statement of values. This can help guide decision-making, and ensure we are intentional about aligning our actions with broadly supported community values (while also being aware and respectful of the diversity of values we represent).  </p>
<p>So we'd love to hear some thoughts from you all here about the values you feel this community embodies, and the values you'd like to see embodied. </p>
<p>(We also discussed this a bit in Nina Otter's ACT@UCR discussion, which led to the creation of this Zulip stream. I spoke a bit more about why I feel this is important in this part: <a href="https://youtu.be/dn_whW1DIws?t=1573">https://youtu.be/dn_whW1DIws?t=1573</a>)</p>
<p>To kick off discussion, I've been discussing, reading, and reflecting over the past couple of weeks, and here's a partial list of things I found that were important to various people:</p>
<ul>
<li>The search for truth and knowledge</li>
<li>Academic freedom</li>
<li>Inclusivity</li>
<li>Pro-active support for careers of young researchers</li>
<li>Intellectual openness and respect</li>
<li>Moving towards a greener world, a more equal world, and a more peaceful world</li>
<li>A positive impact</li>
<li>Collaboration</li>
<li>Community</li>
<li>Not doing harm through our research</li>
<li>Full-on war against crooked publishers</li>
</ul>
<p>Which ones resonate with you, or not? What values would you add? And since phrases are themselves open to interpretation, is there a way you would elaborate on them?</p>

<p>Some thoughts with reference to the only controversial/vague value ("not doing harm to others through our research"), which I would favor expunging from the list.</p>
<p>For context, I understand this value was discussed in relation to the concrete decision of not publicizing the funding from private companies with some links to military applications.</p>
<p>The value as stated feels very naive. For example, what do you mean by harm, and how can applied category theory do harm?</p>
<p>I would like to propose a couple of points for considerations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Mathematical theories cannot be harmful by themselves. It is the applications that can be harmful. And in "applied category theory", "applied" doesn't really mean "applications", as in something that directly touches the world (and therefore can be judged ethically). Applications are done by engineers, not mathematicians. For reference, I work in a field (embodied autonomy) where the good/bad applications are almost isomorphic. It's almost as simple as changing the sign in a cost function - with a minus, the robot saving as many lives as possible; with a plus, it is killing as many as possible. In my field we have ethical quandaries. In my view, the ACT community hovers so far from the applications that it can just relax about this whole issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let's call "useful math" the math that in addition to be beautiful, directly enabled some useful application. Most of the useful math was used for both "good" and "bad" applications (put the definition of "good" and "bad" that you like). Knives do not kill people, people do; and knives are necessary to make good food. Should we not do any math that could be useful for a "bad" application?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For me these considerations settle the issue. Basic research like math and ACT are so far removed from applications that it does not make sense to judge the ethical impact. And yes, any basic theory will be useful for good and bad anyway.</p>
<p>I was not part of the discussion, but my feeling is that putting that value there was just a way to justify, a posteriori, the decision "we do not want to publicize our association with companies with links to the military". The real discussion should be about it, and I have several arguments about that as well, if we want to go there.</p>

<p>Also, the goal of ACT for what I care _is_ to become really applied and useful in the future. I've been very vocal about how keeping ACT on the very pure side of things is actually going to backfire at us and harm the whole community eventually. If you embrace the idea that what we do should indeed become applied at some point, then the question becomes super relevant.</p>

<p>Just to give some context, categorical quantum mechanics is now reaching the stage of becoming actually useful. So, the question of accepting or not military funding is actually super relevant</p>

<p>My opinions on this topic aren't fully-formed or confident, but I'd like to point out that the question of whose funding to accept is somewhat separate than the question of ethics of applications. As far as funding goes, note that Saunders Mac Lane did some algebraic topology and CT on a US air force grant, and the same air force has funded some more recent research into quantum programming languages/categorical semantics thereof. While USAF itself is not the nicest of institutions, it also seems to me that them spending money on CT (that get's published) is preferrable to many other uses they might have for money. I'd be interested in counterarguments to this view.  </p>
<p>As far as judging the applications goes, I'd like to hear how one would actually go about doing it. The usual opinions I hear ("as the technology can be used both good for bad, the responsibilty is fully on the end-user"/"if there is an evil application, then the research shouldn't be done") seem a bit too simplistic to me - what other options are there?</p>

<p>There is a huge discussion about this in the blockchain community. Programmers are literally shaping the financial systems of the future and the problem of governance is very much actual. Saying "we are just devs" doesn't cut it anymore. Essentially, many people involved in the field would like to avoid what happened with AI. People doing AI were thinking pretty much the same (it's just research) and now we have facebook and social media. Also, we have examples of AI being used to persecute minorities and political dissidents in authoritarian regimes. All in all, "it's only science" my ass, one has to evaluate the impact of the research being produced and take responsibility for it.<br>
Alternatives abound. There's a lot of discussion about a sort of "Hippocratic oath for computer scientists" for instance. At Statebox, we are experimenting with the <a href="https://firstdonoharm.dev/">Hippocratic license</a> for our code.</p>

<p>Also, I get the whole argument of "by accepting military funding we are diverting it from the really deadly applications", but imho this is just a delusion people tell themselves to sleep at night. In the end, you are taking money from people whose goal is to optimize how to kill other people, and that's enough for me.</p>

<p>I think this represents a very problematic way of thinking. No idea exists in a vacuum; every discipline has abstract theory attached that can be artificially divorced from the community that practices it and the things it is used for, but that doesn't make those that advance that theory exempt of responsibility for the ways in which it is ultimately applied, <em>especially</em> if they benefit directly or indirectly from the pipeline from theory to applications, as is the case in the "accepting military funding" discussion.</p>

<p>I agree that one should go further than "we're just devs/mathematicians", but given a technology that might get used for both good and bad, how does one actually do research concerning it responsibly? By trying to do some cost/benefit-analysis as far as the use-cases go? Refusing anything with some potential for harmful use?  Insisting on publishing it (so that it's not a secret)? The Hippocratic licence above seems like a cool start, but what exactly prevents countries/private actors operating illegally from disregarding it?  A lot of the technologies we're using every day have their origins in research funded by and for military.</p>

<p>One important thing to keep in mind is that whenever new technology or knowledge is produced in this way, the military get access to it first. And they clearly have the budget to be a lot more... imaginative... about potential applications than we are as researchers. Just because you don't see how the research you're doing could be useful to those funding you doesn't mean that it isn't.</p>

<p>Well, if all of the relevant research outputs get published, then military doesn't know anything that other's don't as well. Otherwise I do agree - just because you don't see how it might get applied doesn't guarantee much. However, I'm still not sure what one should do _concretely_ other than being mindful about this possibility.</p>

<p>One of the difficulties of policy-making is that you can't act against a problem in a systematic way (with regulation or enforcement) unless that problem breaks a law in the region where it occurs. And you can't make something illegal if you don't know about it. This is why we as researchers need to put in the extra effort to think about the consequences of our research, to make those potential consequences clear to those with the power and resources to act against them.</p>

<p>While there's clear examples of some papers e.g in ML that are ethically questionable, as far as I can see no one is recommending a blanket ban on ML research.

<p>Quite the opposite: if there are potential ethical problems in a discipline, it should be studied all the more intensely to resolve those ambiguities and/or take precautions as a community against concrete problems as they are identified.</p>

<p>I disagree; <em>some</em> applied category theory may be far removed from applications, but a lot of the work is not.   You will see a number of business presentations on Wednesday that are <em>extremely</em> applied:</p>

<p>Just to give some context, categorical quantum mechanics is now reaching the stage of becoming actually useful. So, the question of accepting or not military funding is actually super relevant</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the question of whether you should accept military funding is always relevant, even if your research has no applications at all. Accepting funding from a military organization will improve the reputation of that organization, which can lead to them receiving more funding. Or it can lead to more mathematicians being willing to work for that organization. Accepting funding is always seen as an endorsement by the outside world.</p>

<p>I agree that one should go further than "we're just devs/mathematicians", but given a technology that might get used for both good and bad, how does one actually do research concerning it responsibly? By trying to do some cost/benefit-analysis as far as the use-cases go? Refusing anything with some potential for harmful use?  Insisting on publishing it (so that it's not a secret)? The Hippocratic licence above seems like a cool start, but what exactly prevents countries/private actors operating illegally from disregarding it?  A lot of the technologies we're using every day have their origins in research funded by and for military.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, if some nation violates the law you can't do much about it aside of suing them. E.g China often breaks patent laws and well, there's nothing we can do. But at least, using that licence we make a statement. Se say that we don't agree with something and we put some legal framework in place to be able to drag someone to court if they break some requirements.</p>

<p>I have not made a normative claim about accepting military funding. I am merely noting that if you knew the funding trajectory from the OsD to researchers and what the responsibilities of the researchers actually are twoards the military you might not have such a black and white view of it.

<p>We can say that the ACT community doesn't like the idea of getting funding from the military or other ethically dubious venues (e.g. fossil fuel companies), that it condemns it, but that it also understands that this is a forced choice for some research groups. As such, it leaves the choice to the single scientist/research group, but strongly suggests to consider these forms of funding as the very last option available.</p>

<p>How is making a statement on behalf of many people not the same thing? It either singles out people who don't agree with the statement, if you ask for endorsement, or it silently alienates people who disagree. It seems to me that making group statements is generally something you only want to do when you are happy to alienate people who disagree on a particular issue. That's a legitimate choice that communities have to make, but you've got to pick your battles.</p>

<p>This is what I used to think. Maybe it's true in his case, but I'm coming from the perspective of someone who has witnessed a lot of thought policing happening at American universities in particular. In the past these fluff ball statements about this cause or that cause would get filtered out of my mind like spam. If I thought anything at all, I would think "administrators and editors, etc., need something to do when things are running smoothly." But it's pretty clear that these sorts of wide-net group statements and community guidelines do alienate people. The practice has synergised with other political forces so potently that it has cleaved a huge chunk of the population away from academia, and as a consequence, universities recruit far less talent than they could.</p>
<p>I'm not suggesting that <em>all</em> group statements or moral policing is problematic either. I'm just saying that it makes sense to recognize when you are alienating people, even a little, and decide deliberately when you want to alienate people and only do it then.</p>

<p>Maybe, although I took this moment to speak up because this is a much less charged issue than anything else I can think of. It's not a big deal, to be honest. I just wanted to raise a little bit of awareness about how these small acts of divisive rhetoric accumulate. I don't personally feel particularly strongly about the issue. If the ACT people want to make a statement like this, I doubt it would make many waves. But the overall trend of mixing detachable politics with objective research is concerning to me.</p>

For instance, it seems to me that "politics through dialogue" is a long gone practice. People just keep insulting each other on twitter like they were football supporters</p>

<p>That's the sort of thing that a lot of people could easily support.   Some might consider it "toothless", but if you try to get a really effective policy against military funding for ACT, the community could split into a community that doesn't take funding and a community that does.</p>

<p>Thanks, this was helpful. So, given research where either the applications are unclear or they're clearly both good and bad, you should do your best (or at least something/enough) to avoid the bad outcomes. There's still some cases where the meaning of this is a bit unclear to me - let's say your research improves GPUs and thus most of ML becomes slightly more efficient. Does your responsibility roughly amount to trying to get the more applied ML researchers care more about their research ethics?</p>

<p>As for the idea that such a statement would be "toothless." Since when are we trying to bite people we disagree with? Especially on issues that rational people can genuinely disagree on? (Not that you, personally are saying this. But since when is this level of animosity normal communal behavior?)</p>
<p>I don't think it's a cop-out to ask people to take their own choices seriously. When dealing with cognitive dissonance, there are three main strategies: (1) Ignore the feeling until it goes away. (2) change your beliefs to match your behavior. (3) Change your behavior to match your beliefs. Strategy (1) is by far the most common strategy for all of us. Strongly encouraging people to do (2) or (3) in stead of (1) is a serious, difficult thing to ask of people. When it actually happens, its harder and much more benneficial to a community than getting that dopamine hit from regulating things just the way you want them, or making (unenforced) statements that aim at a particular outcome. Your whole career in mathematics is built on faith in rationality as a means of discovery. Why should it end there?</p>

<p>What's "obvious" depends a lot on the community, but yes - Americans have divided into two warring camps, we may even be approaching something like a civil war, so there's a lot of energy being put into making people prove their commitment to one of these camps or another.</p>

<p>"Non-obvious" is a hard thing to pin down, but I don't mean whether an issue is culturally controversial (or how many people feel different ways). I mean more that if you follow best practices in being rational (these standards are generally less controversial than any given issue), is it possible for two people, in good-faith, to disagree on an issue?</p>
<p>This standard changes over time, but only because of advances in critical thinking. Not because of other reasons. That is, if you look at how a person came to his or her conclusion, can you find major fault in the method, rather than just the conclusion?</p>

<p>Okay - I agree with there's a concept of "non-obvious" there.   Alas, most people who support the purity tests you call "non-obvious" consider them to be "obvious" according to their own definition of that term.  Rational decision-making of the sort you advocate plays a rather minor role in US politics today.  I wish ACT could change <em>that</em>.</p>

<p>I like this statement, but for it to be effective it should come with some policies that we explictly sustain. Hippocratic licenses for software could be one of these. Also, it would be very useful if we could share resources among us to set up a network for "clean funding", that is, some kind of repository where we list all the institutions/companies willing to fund ACT projects that aren't ethically desplicable.</p>

<p>The word "toothless" doesn't imply that someone is trying and failing to bite someone they disagree with.  One says e.g. that a law against pollution is "toothless" if it doesn't come with any penalty for breaking it.   So I'm saying: some people might want some sort of code of conduct among ACT people that would involve some penalty - e.g. disapproval by their peers - if they violate it.  </p>

<p>This "founding sources" discussion actually gets even broader: For example, I've spoken with quite a few people in different unis and we are all converging towards a common research theme, albeit from different perspectives. At this point, it would be very nice to submit a coordinated grant application to start a common research project, but I've never written such a grant and I really don't know where to start. I think some form of mentorship for this sort of menial, beaurocratic work would be invaluable, especially for young people like me. In this sense, people in the ACT community could literally teach to other people how to get funding, and in this respect ethics makes a difference: I could be taught that the military is the first institution I have to write to for funding, or I could be taught that I could start somewhere else. Having such a network in place could really influence things positively.</p>

<p>This "founding sources" discussion actually gets even broader: For example, I've spoken with quite a few people in different unis and we are all converging towards a common research theme, albeit from different perspectives. At this point, it would be very nice to submit a coordinated grant application to start a common research project, but I've never written such a grant and I really don't know where to start. I think some form of mentorship for this sort of menial, beaurocratic work would be invaluable, especially for young people like me. In this sense, people in the ACT community could literally teach to other people how to get funding, and in this respect ethics makes a difference: I could be taught that the military is the first institution I have to write to for funding, or I could be taught that I could start somewhere else. Having such a network in place could really influence things positively.</p>

<p>Maybe an ACT "field trip" to one of those Profellow workshops on grant applications next time they do one?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276438">@Fabrizio Genovese</span> It's  a website / company that helps people find funding and offers various services and advice around that theme. Just google Profellow.</p>
<p>Also, take a gander at The Professor Is In by Karen Kelsky. It's a book on how to take control of your academic career for students in the humanities, but the advice is almost exactly valid for pure math students and still usefil for applied people.</p>
<p>Maybe also take a look at Marketing for Scientists Mark Kuchner.</p>

<p>Science (including math) is essentially a whole.  It will inevitably be appropriated by the powers that be.   I only have a quantum of life energy for trying to make things better.   My orientation is not towards trying to anticipate all possible outcomes and resist them, but rather to do what I can to help science along its way, whether through research or other means of support, especially in the hope that it will develop in directions that will help us to figure out better ways to do things than the status quo.   Because it is a whole, a contribution to sector A today may lead to a breakthrough in sector Z tomorrow.</p>

<p>It's all rather nuanced.  US military research, for example, has promoted a sane assessment of the reality of climate change, and so is a progressive force, in this respect, compared to the civilian government.</p>

<p>I could probably help with this, I think I have more experience with grant writing than most people my age. I was planning to submit an EU-wide travel network grant for ACT this year (a thing called a COST grant, administered separately to the ERC), but then the virus got in the way, my plan was to spend 3 weeks in Tallinn a few months ago picking Pawel's brain for that</p>

<p>"We recognise that certain circumstances can make it more difficult for some people to join our community than others, and we seek to provide ways to overcome these difficulties. Thus we are committed to outreach efforts, support open access publishing, reduce costs of participation, work hard to change our culture to be ever more inclusive, and take a broad perspective on ‘merit’." (Inclusion and Equality section)</p>
<p>Point of clarification:</p>
<p>Does this mean the ACT community is opposed to exploitative practices by universities such as the over use of adjuncts who have no prospect of tenure? Or the use of opaque department ranking systems for PhD candidates and tenure candidates? (i.e. is the ACT community pro-union, pro-transparency, etc.)</p>
<p>Or does this mean more that the ACT community is favor of subsidizing the costs caused by these practices? (i.e. diversity-oriented grants, mentorship, etc. that offsets the anti-diversity structural biases in universities)</p>
<p>The way my question is phrased might sound like a loaded question, but it's not. Taking the first route can be very costly to the community. The second route has defensible tradeoffs. I'm just trying to operationalize the statement since it's not clear which approach is being favored.</p>

<p>It's not a dichotomy. There are a lot of valid combinations of values and concessions.</p>
