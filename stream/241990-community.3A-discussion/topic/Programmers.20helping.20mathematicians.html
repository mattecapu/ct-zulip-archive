<p>I just recieved a question from a programmer who loves mathematics and was interested in a quote I made on Hacker News.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A large portion of mathematicians have little coding ability, so I help some amazing people out, learn lots of mathematics and have lots of fun.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find learning mathematical etiquette to be both important and difficult. I believe this is something typically learned in the process of gaining a Ph.D. in mathematics.  I'd love to read anything already written about mathematical etiquette.  I'm still giving the question thought and would like to see if others here could contribute their own advice or even direct me to an article covering the subject.</p>

<p>I don't think I've ever seen anything about "mathematical etiquette".   I can certainly spot violations of it.   I imagine a lot of it applies to academia in general, while some is particular to math.  But I'd like to read anything anybody has written about it.</p>
<p>I have a page called <a href="https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/advice.html">Advice</a>, which is advice mainly for young mathematicians and physicists - and people who don't know whether they want to go into math or physics.   I wrote it a long time ago, and in several different stages where I had different things on my mind.   I don't have the energy to improve it now.  But anyway, it's not mainly about "etiquette", but it may have some overlap.</p>

<p>I think there is something really interesting here. I don't know if I would call this mathematical etiquette, but I've had many attempted mathematical conversations with people who were not trained as PhD mathematicians that left me annoyed or frustrated. Now I've certainly done the same to others countless times, but upon reflection, I think there are a couple of really key points that can make mathematical conversations go better. Here are some of my thoughts, I'm curious what other people think.</p>
<p>Tips for talking with a mathematician:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Be as rigorous as possible. Know what mathematical objects you are talking about. Give them letters. My advisor used to drill this into me as a student, we used to go for walks and I would have to explain to him what I had learned just using my voice. This was an incredibly helpful practice for me. I would actually practice saying out loud "Let M be a finite dimensional smooth manifold such that ..." In other words, know how to make a mathematical statement.<br>
Example: "I learned that if you've got a space, then at every point there's an R^n attached to it" versus "I learned that if M is an n-dimensional smooth manifold, then at every point x in M you can define a vector space T_x, called the tangent space at x, defined as ..."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't bullshit. If you don't know something, or don't understand it well enough to talk about at a level of rigor, just say that and figure out what common ground of understanding you can find.</p>
</li>
<li>Keep it short and focused. In my experience, mathematicians sometimes tend to be rather terse, especially when talking about mathematics. If a rigorous discussion is flooded with extra irrelevant remarks or the topic keeps switching, then it may be hard to follow.</li>
<li>Hedge, but don't unnecessarily hedge. Instead of saying "it may possibly be the fact, even though I'm really not sure, and you probably have a much better understanding than me but..." just say "i'm not sure if this is true, but ..." This helps out a lot with point 3.</li>
<li>If you make a mathematical claim, be prepared to sketch a proof of it, or provide a reference. It can be annoying for somebody to make a bunch of claims but not remember where they had heard it from or have any idea why its true.</li>
<li>Don't interrupt if the other person is speaking. Even if you are excited, let them finish their thought before interjecting.</li>
<li>Make sure you are all on the same page. Take breaks to ask if the other person understands what you are saying or if they have any questions. If you get lost at some point, say so.</li>
</ol>

<p>I hope it's the latter.  On MathOverflow they want questions that are crisp, parse correctly, are phrased in terms of known mathematical concepts, and are not questions whose answers you could easily look up in a textbook.  Also, they don't like drama.</p>

<p>My experience and hopes on mathoverflow are like yours, John, and while I may be relatively well-known now, I was just a barely minted PhD when it started out.  It's possible that different subcommunities of mathematicians behave differently on mathoverflow.  I do think there's probably a something else, whether we call it etiquette, culture, or what, that you and I do without thinking about it but that's hard for others to break into.  I have had quite negative experiences on other stackexchange sites; perhaps the people there are nastier, but perhaps I just don't know their shibboleths.</p>

<p>In my understanding, Mathoverflow is more for professionals, which would explain the level of scrutiny (and perhaps the flames), whereas <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/">Math stack exchange</a> aims at a broader audience.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span> What you are talking about is exactly what I mean by mathematical etiquette. Not being able to be a part of mathematics academia, I had fundamental issues with communicating mathematics.  That can be very frustrating for a number of mathematicians, but even more importantly it indicates a major avenue of possible growth which I have embraced. Instead of being upset with getting flamed, I should have focused more on understanding what was frustrating the people I was communicating with. I have felt lost in the woods for decades due to my lack of understanding the needs of the people I was dealing with. Having been a moderator of a mathematics forum I would like to provide people with the roadmap that I never had.</p>

<p>I think it would be fun to hear about it.   Having been talking to mathematicians all my life (or so it feels), there's probably a lot that I take for granted and don't notice anymore.</p>

You now seem very good at what we might call the "game" of talking about math, which is a very efficient way to uncover a lot of facts through conversation, where two or more people ask each other questions, work on these questions together, keep track of what's being assumed and what's been shown at any stage of the conversation, point out each other's mistakes and clearly admit when they've made mistakes, decide jointly to temporarily give up on some questions because they're too hard, etc.</p>

<p>I do recall a huge transformation in how you talk here, <span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="277503">David Egolf</span>.  You now seem very good at what we might call the "game" of talking about math, which is a very efficient way to uncover a lot of facts through conversation, where two or more people ask each other questions, work on these questions together, keep track of what's being assumed and what's been shown at any stage of the conversation, point out each other's mistakes and clearly admit when they've made mistakes, decide jointly to temporarily give up on some questions because they're too hard, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The way you're describing a mathematical conversation makes me think to the way Socrates wants to discuss with Gorgias in the dialogue <em>Gorgias</em> by Plato. So it must be a good time for me to throw out my favorite extract from this book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SOCRATES: You, Gorgias, like myself, have had great experience of disputations, and you must have observed, I think, that they do not always terminate in mutual edification, or in the definition by either party of the subjects which they are discussing; but disagreements are apt to arise – somebody says that another has not spoken truly or clearly; and then they get into a passion and begin to quarrel, both parties conceiving that their opponents are arguing from personal feeling only and jealousy of themselves, not from any interest in the question at issue. And sometimes they will go on abusing one another until the company at last are quite vexed at themselves for ever listening to such fellows. Why do I say this? Why, because I cannot help feeling that you are now saying what is not quite consistent or accordant with what you were saying at first about rhetoric. And I am afraid to point this out to you, lest you should think that I have some animosity against you, and that I speak, not for the sake of discovering the truth, but from jealousy of you. Now if you are one of my sort, I should like to cross-examine you, but if not I will let you alone. And what is my sort? you will ask. I am one of those who are very willing to be refuted if I say anything which is not true, and very willing to refute any one else who says what is not true, and quite as ready to be refuted as to refute; for I hold that this is the greater gain of the two, just as the gain is greater of being cured of a very great evil than of curing another. For I imagine that there is no evil which a man can endure so great as an erroneous opinion about the matters of which we are speaking; and if you claim to be one of my sort, let us have the discussion out, but if you would rather have done, no matter;–let us make an end of it.</p>

<p>I'll list below some things I've found helpful in communicating with mathematicians in text format, coming from an engineering background. I've formatted the list as if I was giving advice to my younger self:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try to make it easy for mathematicians to engage with what you say! If you want to talk about a possible application to engineering things, resist the temptation to describe your application in technical detail. At least, don't do this right away!</li>
<li>Again, make it easy for mathematicians to engage with what you say. One way to do this is to ask a broad/intuitive/conceptual question, ideally paired with a short example that illustrates a possible specific context for discussion. Providing an example you understand will make it more likely that you will understand the resulting discussion.</li>
<li>Don't mix vague intuition and precise examples in a confusing way. Make it clear that you understand (or don't understand!) a mathematical argument, while keeping this separate from concerns or questions you have at a more vague conceptual level.</li>
<li>People - mathematicians included - like to explain things they understand and think are interesting and helpful. So if a mathematician takes your topic of interest on what looks like a tangent, try to view this as an opportunity to learn and not an inconvenient distraction. The "tangent" may have more relevance than you suspect! But be willing to re-centre a discussion, too.</li>
<li>Try to copy standard notation and conventions. Continually consider if there are any small ways in which you can communicate more clearly.</li>
<li>If you get lost when trying to communicate to a mathematician, don't despair. Instead try to explain to yourself exactly how you are lost, ideally with an example. Often this will help you get un-lost. And if you are still lost, you will be in a better place to ask the mathematician clarifying questions.</li>
<li>You want to make it interesting and rewarding for mathematicians to engage with what you say to them. Thank them for their time and effort, even if you can't provide a response that engages more directly with the technical aspects of what they just said. Try to show mathematicians who talk to you that you spend time and energy thinking about what they said. This can double as a great way to further an interesting conversation.</li>
<li>Do not overstate how much you understand something. Don't do this when talking to others, and don't do it when talking to yourself. Recognize that learning math is a long road, and that often you won't be as far along as you could wish you were.</li>
<li>Recognize that you will make mistakes, and make it clear that you are grateful to have them pointed out. That being said, try to make clear and correct comments. Proofread what you say.</li>
<li>Recognize that you will not only make minor mistakes: you will make major conceptual mistakes. These will likely call into question your entire approach to some application or area of interest. Don't panic or despair when this happens, and instead be happy that you've made such a big step forward in your understanding.</li>
<li>Try to create conversational settings (either through your own initiative, or through your cooperation with the initiative of someone else) where there is a specific goal. This helps mathematicians have a clearer idea of what to say to you, which makes it more likely they will engage with what you are saying. Solving exercises or "puzzles" can be an excellent way to do this. Sometimes a mathematician will state a precise puzzle on their own, but don't feel afraid  to state a precise puzzle yourself and ask for help with it. Recognize that your efforts to create conversational will not always succeed, and that is okay.</li>
<li>Recognize that a mathematical proof in practice is just something that convinces mathematicians. Try to not worry about making things "rigorous" unless a mathematician tells you that you need to worry about this more than you are. At the same time, try to ensure that any proof you write is clear and compelling to you.</li>
<li>Overall, try to view conversation with mathematicians as a wonderful and exciting thing! Approach conversations with enthusiasm, and be willing to put a lot of work in - it's worth the effort.</li>
</ul>

<p>Oh - one last thing comes to mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recognize that examples and concepts are often more "primitive" than definitions or theorems. They are what lead to definitions/theorems, and what illustrate definitions/theorems. So it's often a good idea to move a discussion to a specific example of interest.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm taking notes from Egolf's list <span aria-label="sweat smile" class="emoji emoji-1f605" role="img" title="sweat smile">:sweat_smile:</span>. </p>
<p>Regarding mathoverflow vs this Zulip. I want to add the pros here seem to have a very strong grasp on when and why conventions get broken, and often patiently guide an asker "back on track".</p>
<p>If an asker breaks conventions on mathoverflow, something about the structure or culture makes it hard to help the asker communicate better. This seems to be an issue across all the exchanges in my experience.</p>

<p>MathOverflow is different because it's not for conversations - it's pretty close to a strict one-question, many-answer format.  People can and do leave "comments" to help questioners fix their question, but the whole setup is not aimed at dialogue: free-ranging conversation is discouraged.</p>

<p>I've just noticed that the word "etiquette" could be more revealing than I thought. The word reminds me the rules that governed people's behavior at Versailles, rules that were strongly informed (I guess) by the nobles' ranks and titles.</p>
<p>I don't know about other countries, but in France, mathematics, as it is taught to children from a very young age up to, at least high school, is mostly used to <em>select</em> people. This creates strong feelings of "being too dumb for maths", of not "being worth it", and "being excluded". I find this very sad.</p>
<p>It is true that the craft requires a certain way of talking about it, as very well illustrated by the various lists above. It might be interesting to also present a <em>counter-etiquette</em>, for how members of the math community should behave w.r.t. "outsiders".</p>

<p>Reviewing my earlier writings I see a transformation from self promotion to a neutral point of view that promotes mathematics itself. With this in mind I have rewritten my mathematics website to represent the mathematics community. Even though I am the sole author of the website, I can no longer tell that. I have removed myself from the "equation."</p>
<p>Over time my interest has shifted from developing mathematics to developing mathematicians. I see much of etiquette as not just the intelligence to  do mathematics but also the wisdom to interact with people while not expressing any ego. I spent a decade as a monk where I learned about serving others. </p>

<p>I don't think I've ever seen anything about "mathematical etiquette". I can certainly spot violations of it.</p>

<p>Self knowledge and self mastery can elevate etiquette to the level of art.</p>
<p>Maybe the highest form of etiquette is to demonstrate growth from others effort to advance their understanding.</p>

<p>I think that mathematicians slowly grow to think far more literally and precisely than most people do, which is why the uninitiated can be caught off guard by a feeling of difficulty in communicating with them.</p>
<p>Timothy Gowers once tweeted about how mathematicians gain “sensitivity to types”, giving an example of a question he asked his son about calculus, and how his son combined the idea of the derivative of a function with the tangent line of its graph, or something.</p>
