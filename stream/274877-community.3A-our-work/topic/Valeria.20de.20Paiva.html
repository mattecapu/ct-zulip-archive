<p>I think the idea of this channel is very nice, but find kind of difficult to write my own version. Here's an attempt.</p>
<ol>
<li>I intend to continue thinking and writing about  "Dialectica constructions and Polynomials" -- the "and" is distributive, only dialectica and only polynomials are included. There's the work with Davide Trotta and Matteo Spadetto on the Godel Fibration (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14021">https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14021</a>), which has just appeared in MFCS and its sequel, which we're working on now.</li>
<li>There is the work on networked mathematics with Brendan and others that need to be written about. But at least there is the blog post (<a href="https://topos.site/blog/2021/07/introducing-the-mathfoldr-project/">https://topos.site/blog/2021/07/introducing-the-mathfoldr-project/</a>)</li>
<li>There is the work with Katerina Kalouli on semantics of natural languages, available from her resources page (<a href="https://cis.lmu.de/~kalouli/resources.html">https://cis.lmu.de/~kalouli/resources.html</a>) that needs to be explored. The beautiful GKR framework (for graphical knowledge representation) has been put in place (go and play with it, if interested), now is time to use it!</li>
<li>There is the work with Luiz Carlos and Elaine in ecumenical systems (these have in the same framework both constructive and classical logic), after "A proof theoretical view of ecumenical systems"  and "An Ecumenical Notion of Entailment" (<a href="https://vcvpaiva.github.io/includes/pubs/2019-ecumenical.pdf">https://vcvpaiva.github.io/includes/pubs/2019-ecumenical.pdf</a>). We're working on the role of negation in this framework.</li>
<li>There are several  semi-written papers about lexical resources and semantics for Portuguese with Alexandre Rademaker that need to be finished. The Portuguese wordnet project is up at <a href="http://openwordnet-pt.org">http://openwordnet-pt.org</a>, but I need to think about next steps.</li>
</ol>
<p>So there are too many  loose ends and what I call facetiously "ValeriaReprints" that need to be finished. Collaboration in all  these projects is very welcome!</p>

<p>small update:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>sequel of previous item #1 is "Dialectica Logical Principles" (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08064">https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08064</a>), accepted for LFCS2022.  Davide and Matteo working very fast.<br>
work with Elena di Lavore and Wilmer Leal in "Dialectica Petri Nets" is in the arXiv <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12801">https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12801</a>, has been submitted to SYCO.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some work on NLI/ECD is still been written, but a paper was accepted and will be presented at STIL (Nov 29th to Dec 3rd, 2021) <a href="http://comissoes.sbc.org.br/ce-pln/stil2021/index.html">http://comissoes.sbc.org.br/ce-pln/stil2021/index.html</a></p>
</li>
<li>Work on Ecumenical systems still not written, but talk submitted to  1st Meeting Brazil-Colombia in Logic<br>
<a href="https://sites.google.com/unal.edu.co/i-enclogbracol/">https://sites.google.com/unal.edu.co/i-enclogbracol/</a><br>
#2 and #5 are letting the side down, but happy to report that the work on IMLA (Intuitionistic Modal Logic and Applications 2017) with Artemov has just appeared  (<a href="https://collegepublications.co.uk/ifcolog/?00050">https://collegepublications.co.uk/ifcolog/?00050</a>) and I got to know about it because a friend in Australia  Shawn tweeted about it!<br>
Hugo's undergrad thesis submitted as conference paper, Roberta master thesis on CodeNames examined are the extras, so far.</li>
</ol>

<p>I had almost given up on writing here on things that will happen, but now I have an important announcement.<br>
Next year there will be a Hausdorff Institute of Mathematics (Bonn, DE) Trimester on <a href="https://www.him.uni-bonn.de/programs/future-programs/future-trimester-programs/prospects-of-formal-mathematics/description/">"Prospects on Formalized Mathematics"</a> and people can apply to it, especially junior people. So if you're interested in Formalization of Mathematics, read about the trimester, May-August 2024 (organized together with Kevin Buzzard, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="296322">@Jacques Carette</span> , Michael Kohlhase, and Josef Urban) and apply!</p>

<p>Two years later (oh dear, where did the time go?)<br>
The  trimester program on <a href="https://www.him.uni-bonn.de/programs/future-programs/future-trimester-programs/prospects-of-formal-mathematics/description/">"Prospects on Formalized Mathematics"</a> was great! We also had a meeting <a href="https://www.mathematics.uni-bonn.de/him/programs/special-events/women-in-formal-math">Women in Formal Mathematics</a> that was pretty cool! a very late blog post can be found <a href="https://logic-forall.blogspot.com/2025/09/women-in-formal-mathematics-2024.html">here</a>. There was also MFPS together with ACT in Oxford, a blog post should be in the works.</p>
<p>Earlier in 2025,  we had  a <a href="https://sigma.mathsworlds.org/activities/brics-icms/discussion/">BRICS Mathematics: online discussion series</a> and a great time in Edinburgh visiting Michael Barany and collaborators. Then in July there was <a href="https://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/summerschool/summer25/topics.php">OPLSS</a> in Oregon. </p>
<p>In October  2025(6-10) there will be <a href="https://cicm-conference.org/2025/cicm.php">CICM 2025</a>, yay!!</p>
<p>But as far as work -- real work -- is concerned, the new material on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15765">Skolem, Gödel, and Hilbert fibrations</a> with Davide Trotta and Jon Weinberger is submitted. The work  on <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.12801">Petri nets</a> with Elena and Wilmer is accepted, but has not appeared. The work on the <a href="http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/volumes/40/fwd/40-fwd.pdf">special issue</a> of TAC  for Marta Bunge has appeared, but the link doesn't show up in Google Scholar. The work on ecumenical logic and <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11225-024-10105-5.pdf">translations</a> with Elaine and Luiz Carlos has appeared. As has the preprint on Natural Language Inference for mathematical text that <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.23063">should be easy</a>. Loads of project proposals have been rejected, as expected. I just need to get the disposition to try again.</p>
