<p>It won't be very long because I am a very young researcher but here's what I am working on.</p>
<ol>
<li>I am working with monads and distributive laws to model the combination of non-determinism, probability and termination as quantitative algebraic effects (in the sense of Mardare, Panangaden and Plotkin - LICS2016) --- in an internship with Daniela Petrişan.</li>
<li>I am in the middle of my PhD applications.</li>
<li>I take part in a reading group on topos theory, we are reading <em>Generic Figures and Their Glueings</em>. This is a lot of fun, so I might want to start another group soon.</li>

<p>One thing I like a lot about that book is that it works many concrete examples of topos-theoretic constructions, in the setting of presheaf categories where you can really calculate things. The running examples include sets, graphs, reflexive graphs, and discrete dynamic systems (or "evolutive sets," as the authors call them).</p>

<p>I don't think I am being very productive on all fronts. I like to have many different projects so that whenever I lose focus on one, I can try to think about the others. Only 4 and 5 have real timing requirements so I can work on the first three at my own pace.</p>

<p>Hi Ralph, your work seems intriguing to me. I wonder whether you took into consideration <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14641">Rosicky's work on metric monads</a> and what would be the link between the two.</p>

<p>I have read this paper and this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03880v1">other related paper</a>, but I am not comfortable with enriched categories, locally presentable categories and accessible categories, so I don't understand every detail. From my understanding, the solution we crafted to talk about operations which are not nonexpansive (see Second extension axis in the introduction) is not something either paper can deal with. That was my main motivation for writing this paper, every thing I read on (categorical) universal algebras deals with operations of type <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>X</mi><mi>n</mi></msup><mo>→</mo><mi>X</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">X^n \to X</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07847em;">X</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.6644em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mathnormal mtight">n</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">→</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07847em;">X</span></span></span></span> or <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><mi>n</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>X</mi><mo stretchy="false">]</mo><mo>→</mo><mi>X</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">[n,X] \to X</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">[</span><span class="mord mathnormal">n</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07847em;">X</span><span class="mclose">]</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">→</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07847em;">X</span></span></span></span>, where the product or function space is constructed <strong>categorically</strong>, i.e.: with the categorical product or its adjoint.</p>
<p>Now, our solution is to almost take a product (we take a lifting of the product) as the domain of the operation. It turns out, as our paper shows, this still leads to a nice theory (very close to Mardare et al.'s approach).</p>
<p>In order to really understand the link between our paper and Rosicky's, I would like to extend our solution to lift the function space too (i.e. have more general arities as in Ford et al.'s paper), and translate our work to the categorical language used in Rosicky's paper (the Lawvere-Linton way of doing universal algebra). I don't see how to do this right now, but I am looking for solutions, and I wanted to ask here at some point for some help.</p>

That was my main motivation for writing this paper, every thing I read on (categorical) universal algebras deals with operations of type <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>X</mi><mi>n</mi></msup><mo>→</mo><mi>X</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">X^n \to X</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07847em;">X</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.6644em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mathnormal mtight">n</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">→</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07847em;">X</span></span></span></span> or <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><mi>n</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>X</mi><mo stretchy="false">]</mo><mo>→</mo><mi>X</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">[n,X] \to X</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mopen">[</span><span class="mord mathnormal">n</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07847em;">X</span><span class="mclose">]</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">→</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6833em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.07847em;">X</span></span></span></span>, where the product or function space is constructed <strong>categorically</strong>, i.e.: with the categorical product or its adjoint.</p>
<p>Now, our solution is to almost take a product (we take a lifting of the product) as the domain of the operation. It turns out, as our paper shows, this still leads to a nice theory (very close to Mardare et al.'s approach).</p>
<p>In order to really understand the link between our paper and Rosicky's, I would like to extend our solution to lift the function space too (i.e. have more general arities as in Ford et al.'s paper), and translate our work to the categorical language used in Rosicky's paper (the Lawvere-Linton way of doing universal algebra). I don't see how to do this right now, but I am looking for solutions, and I wanted to ask here at some point for some help.</p>

<p>Thanks Ralph. I also told Jiri about your work, I think that's a quite cool development.</p>

<li>My <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09087">paper</a> with Matteo Mio and Valeria Vignudelli was accepted at LICS 2022, I am implementing the reviewers' suggestions.</li>
<li>I was accepted at the adjoint school, so I have been working on this (on Fillipo Bonchi's project), and I am excited to go to Glasgow in July.</li>
<li>Next week, I am supervising an internship with a high school student.

<p>I am getting back to you (especially <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275899">@Christian Williams</span>  and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span>) on my internship.</p>
<p>I spent 4 days with a high school student (16 years old) trying to show him what research in maths/cs is. Out of those 4 days, around 1.5 days was spent on discovering the 2-dimensional syntax for relations described in <a href="https://richardblute.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/williams-novfest.mp4">Christian's talk</a>. Every time I introduced a new piece of syntax, we spent a lot of time finding examples and asking simple questions before moving on, and by the end of the week, we were able to cover relations, composition of relations, implications, vertical and horizontal composition of implications. I am not sure what to think of the end result. On the one hand, he and I had fun exploring these ideas and I believe the graphical syntax definitely helped him throughout our work. On the other hand, on the last day, he was supposed to prepare a quick explanation of what he did during the week to share with other students who did a similar internship, but he told me he was not confident enough in his understanding of relations, so we switched to a more <strong>concrete</strong> subject.</p>
<p>Let me give a bit more details. It was really hard for him to find examples and questions by himself. I think the main problem is that he is not used to abstract reasoning, and I think I was bad at pointing out the relevant patterns. For instance, whenever we dealt with composition of two relations, he had to draw the points in the colors and links between them before understanding (that's I think the main good point about the syntax: the points and links picture for a relation embeds well in the syntax). This was easier when dealing with relations between a set and itself, in particular, familial relationships (dad, cousin, grandparent, etc.) between humans and the usual orders on integers. I found he was not very enthusiastic about our findings, so I'd like to look for better examples of things to prove (for me, the best thing we have proved is that if a relation is reflexive, then it is dense, we had lots of examples of dense and non-dense relations and we figured out all dense ones were reflexive, so we showed the implication (very easily) graphically).</p>
<p>TLDR: Teaching relations to a high school student is very hard, but I believe it is less hard when using a graphical syntax.</p>

<li>father of father is paternal grandfather,  father of parent is grandfather.</li>
<li>father implies parent and father implies father so we get paternal grandfather implies grandfather.</li>

<p>Update.</p>
<ol>
<li>I am in Montréal right now visiting Prakash Panangaden. It's fun being back here, and Prakash has so much to teach me. We are not making as much progress as I expected, but I am in no rush.</li>
<li>In meetings with Prakash, he told me that McGill has historically been very hostile to category theory (even if they had several stars who held lots of seminars in Montréal), and that is probably why the team didn't get renewed. As revenge, I have been introducing diagrammatic reasoning to anyone that would listen. I had good discussions when giving <a href="https://ralphs16.github.io/src/MMSGSTalk.pdf">this talk</a> a couple of times.</li>
<li>I participate in biweekly discussions on pedagogy in mathematics organized by Rosalie Bélanger-Rioux. It's quite informative and it confirms my slight preference of teaching over research.</li>
<li>I am trying to accelerate my progress on my <a href="https://ralphs16.github.io/src/CatLectures/DraftBook.pdf">category theory notes/book</a>, because I am thinking of putting a first finished version in the appendix of my thesis, so I can link to definitions/results/notation from it using the <a href="https://www.irif.fr/~colcombe/knowledge_en.html">knowledge package</a>.</li>
<li>I miss the dynamics of my lab, my office mate, and especially my supervisors in Lyon (we still meet and talk online), but I am trying to make the most of my time alone to figure out what I want to do with my thesis (this is hard!).</li>

<p>Update.</p>
<ol>
<li>I got back in Lyon in January, and started working more intensely with my supervisors, which resulted in a paper I am writing right now.</li>
<li>I am still meeting with Prakash, but I haven't been able to do what we want to do. In short, we are looking at another distance between probability distributions, and we want to show it leads to a monad lifting of the distribution monad on <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="bold">S</mi><mi mathvariant="bold">e</mi><mi mathvariant="bold">t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{Set}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6861em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathbf">Set</span></span></span></span></span> to a category of metric spaces.</li>
<li>I was TAing for two classes this semester <em>Semantics and Verification</em> and <em>Proofs and Programs</em>. The latter included an intro to CT up to cartesian closed categories (and the Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence) but without doing a lot with functors and naturality (a bit like Steve Awodey's book). It is always nice to see students improving in categorical thinking throughout the semester.</li>
<li>I am going to Prakash's workshop in Barbados in a month. Many people have told me great things about it, and I am especially glad to go since the subject is exactly what my thesis should be about.</li>
<li>I am giving my diagrammatic reasoning <a href="https://ralphs16.github.io/src/MMSGSTalk.pdf">talk</a> once again, and this will be a warm-up for another research internship with high school student(s) I am doing next week. I plan to try teaching a diagrammatic language of relations again, but I am still not sure if I want to do Christian's version like last time or Bonchi et al's <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08699">version</a> (similar to graphical linear algebra). I want to keep better notes on what I do this time to better answer your questions.</li>

<p>Update for the start of term.</p>
<ol>
<li>I am working on making our latest paper on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14361">Universal Quantitative Algebra</a> fit the LMCS page limit to submit there.</li>
<li>I am preparing a presentation on this (focusing on section 7) for a seminar in Paris that Marie Kerjean kindly invited me to.</li>
<li>I have been working more intensely on the quotient stuff started <a href="#narrow/stream/229136-theory.3A-category-theory/topic/Splitting.20an.20idempotent.20to.20quotient.20a.20monad">here</a> with Jean-Baptiste Vienney, but I think we will slow down now and postpone writing the paper for later.</li>
<li>I have to start structuring my thesis more carefully. I think I know the big picture of what I want to sell, but the details and some results are still missing from my game plan. My defense is planned for next September, so I believe my manuscript must be done by June.</li>
<li>I am organizing the introduction to category theory class this semester. I won't get to teach much (well I teach younger students how to teach the class), but I think I will have at least as much fun as last time (Fall 2021). </li>
<li>I did not take the time to write my experience report on the string diagrams internship. For some reasons, it does not feel good to think about writing it, so I haven't. I will probably do one again this year (in winter), but I am also trying to do other mediation activities (in particular, there is an exposition on maths and cooking in the maths/cs museum next to my school which I will get to animate).</li>

<p>Very briefly, instead of deriving equalities between terms we want to derive distances between terms. It has some interesting subtleties like the fact that the context (variables) may contain quantitative information as well, so the distance between terms depends on the distance between inputs.</p>

<p>In the process of reading your paper and it seems very exciting so far.I'm interested in more specific things related to combining fuzziness and logic/algebra/"Theory B".For example,i'm interested in a structure similar to a generic category with product of homsets equipped with some partial fuzzy relation (a metric or mutual information of ouput for example) so instead of strict morphism equality we have a metric that we can optimize.I'm also interested in theretically analyzing (and then using those results in practice) the case of adding a unary fuzzy relation (idk what to call it,too many terms.a statistic?a real-valued function?) to homsets inspired by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0803.3608">The Category Theoretic arithmetic of information</a> where generalized axioms are derived from information theory for a function I:Hom(C)-&gt;R so that it would be a 'measure of information' and then some really interesting examples are given.I wonder if there would be any interesting relationship between the unary I operator and the binary 'distance' of morphisms if for example both are some information theretic functions,like the connection between kolmogorov and statistical complexity. Basically i'm intrested in quantitative generalized algebraic theories with a special case being categories,mostly the use case being using  those structures as a way of knowledge representation and an architectural principle for AI.If there's any papers like that I would love to hear about them.</p>
<p>Also,it feels validating that this whole combination of fuzziness and Theory B stuff is coming back into vogue when I was thinking about it for years :)</p>

<p>I haven't thought too much about the multisorted case yet. I am guessing if if you want all the morphisms to form a metric space, it will not be too hard to adapt our results, but making every hom-set  a metric space on its own will be more difficult with something like algebraic theories (the hom-sets are dependent types).</p>
<p>Your description made me think of normed or weighted categories which I learned about <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06591">here</a>.</p>
<p>I believe we are probably rediscovering some things known to the fuzzy logic community, but also probably providing new insights. I witnessed an inspiring discussion about this at a talk given by Radu Mardare on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01224">this paper</a>.</p>

<p>Generalized algebraic theories are basically dependent types as far as i understand and im interested in exploring fuzzifying commutativity and see what would happen to universal constructions in that case.i have a few intuitions specific to (co)limits but in general i think a strict definition of a universal construction could be seen as a target of optimization for a fuzzy predicate of commutativity. the limit of zero entropy (perfect commutativity/match) would coincide with equality.thanks for the references!</p>

<p>Update (to motivate myself).</p>
<ol>
<li>We submitted <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14361">that paper</a> to LMCS. I was able to remove enough stuff without hurting the paper (even improving it in some places).</li>
<li>I gave my talk last month in Paris, and I gave the same talk last week in Chambéry where Tom Hirschowitz kindly invited me. Here are the <a href="https://ralphs16.github.io/src/TalkLIMD.pdf">slides</a>.</li>
<li>I have started to write my thesis <span aria-label="partying face" class="emoji emoji-1f973" role="img" title="partying face">:partying_face:</span>. In the last month, I have mostly been procrastinating on starting to write, but it was kind of a productive procrastination. Since I have already written 80% of a book on category theory, I want to make it so that whenever I use basic CT notions in my thesis there is a link to the appropriate part of my book. It would be just like the <a href="https://www.irif.fr/~colcombe/knowledge_en.html">knowledge package</a> except between two pdf files (I will also use knowledge inside my thesis). I only needed to fix the chapter on adjunctions which was not satisfactory to me for a first draft, but I got carried away when writing and added more and more stuff. I didn't start working on making this knowledge links between files work.</li>
<li>We have already got a few people confirmed for my defense in September (the most important ones), so I am starting to feel the pressure.</li>
<li>The CT class I am teaching to teach is going great. I am very happy with my students, but I don't get to interact too much with my grand-students which is a bit sad.</li>
<li>I have been trained for the various mediation activities I will do this semester. They start in November and I am very excited (also scared I won't like working with a class of younger (high school) students).</li>

<p>Very cool that you want to link every basic notion to the definition in your book. Looks like a quite futuristic way to present math.

<p>Ralph I mentioned this recently on another thread but I have recently discovered and started using a LaTeX package called "Semantic Tex" or sTeX which I use to add nice markup to mathematical documents (hyperlinks between definitions)<br>
It facilitates breaking up a long document like a book into many small pieces which can be assembled together, in a more sophisticated way than just using \input or \include, in the sense that cross-references still work right between different files.<br>
You can also reuse pieces more easily (a long definition you want to include somewhere else with the same notation)<br>
And it exports to html in a fairly readable way, they have a simple webserver app that they supply with the semantic tex package that basically turns your paper or book into an interlinked wiki with things split up / arranged the same way you arrange your tex files.</p>

<li>Last week, I finished the <a href="/user_uploads/21317/k4BuQfCq5mRvNIzvDqg4opM-/main.pdf">main body</a> of the thesis which now consists of only 3 chapters (because I will not have time to write chapters 4 and 5...). I will now start to write the introduction, conclusion and abstract. In parallel, my supervisors are reading the main body and they will give me feedback when they are done.</li>
<li>Last Friday, I saw my supervisor Matteo do what is essentially a grown-up version of my thesis defense in September (it is a French thing called HDR which allows him to officially supervise PhD students). I had a good time talking with the members of the jury, especially Ana Sokolova, about maths and not maths.</li>
<li>My courses are done! Research is at a halt probably until I am done writing my thesis.</li>
<li>This week, I took a "break" from writing the thesis as I had two high school (16yo) interns with me. We studied the string diagrammatic syntax for relations (Figure 2 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07055">here</a>) and proofs by induction. I will not promise to write-up a report this time, but I can answer any question you may have, the soonest the better (so I remember stuff more vividly). A brief summary: it was very fun again, we did relations, then compositions, then identities, then implications, then parallel compositions (monoidal products), we explained some of the axioms of Figure 2  in loc. cit. and discussed lots of examples. Then, we did some proofs by induction for the standard series, 1+...+ n, 1² + ...+ n², and so on to explain induction, and we combined it with diagrammatic reasoning to do all the proofs in <a href="https://graphicallinearalgebra.net/2015/05/16/natural-numbers-diagrammatically/">this post of GLA</a>.</li>
<li>Oh, and I decided to use the following title for my thesis: <em>Lifting Algebraic Reasoning to Generalized Metric Spaces</em>. Hopefully it follows John Baez's <a href="#narrow/stream/274877-community.3A-our-work/topic/John.20Baez/near/426206979">advice</a>. (I had another shorter/punchier but overzealous title.)</li>

<p>The paper that you link in 4. looks so cool! I remember that Nathan Haydon made a talk about the calculus of relations of Peirce (from 1897!) at FMCS 2022 which was more like a philosophy talk (he talked about the history of this calculus in the work of Peirce if I remember correctly) and Paweł Sobociński seemed not very convinced about this stuff because the talk wasn't like an usual math talk. This is so cool that they ended writing a paper together (and with the two other authors) improving this mysterious calculus of Peirce into a graphical language for first-order logic!

<p>Thanks! I was scared I could not attend the talk because I'll be travelling from Ottawa to my parents near Bayonne in France tomorrow, but it looks like the talk will start just one hour after I'll arrive at their home. I hope they will not be angry at me if I go away some time to listen to the talk :)</p>

<p>Update 2 months after graduating.</p>
<ol>
<li>I successfully defended in September. The reviews on my thesis stressed me out a bit because they asked difficult questions I could not answer. I worked on it for all of summer, and I felt ready for my defense. (In France, you get reviews a couple of months before your defense.) Unfortunately, none of the questions I found satisfactory answers to were asked (I had even prepared slides for them...). Still, the jury seemed to like my work and my talk, and they awarded me with my PhD degree. <span aria-label="tada" class="emoji emoji-1f389" role="img" title="tada">:tada:</span> </li>
<li>After a few weeks of holidays, I quickly got back to work on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09229">this paper</a> with new collaborators. We had been working (somewhat independently) on these ideas for a while, so we were able to spew out a paper in a month (research + writing). The story is not complete in my opinion, but it is now polished enough to share with the community.</li>
<li>I moved to London in October to work with Fabio Zanasi at UCL. I am enjoying it, the research group and the city.</li>
<li>I am now focusing on diagrammatic reasoning for probabilistic programming, combined with nondeterministic choice and quantitative reasoning.</li>
<li>A couple of very appealing lecturer positions opened, so I am applying to them. I am not expecting anything because I am a very young researcher, but I have to start building my application for later, so I might as well start now.</li>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="351836">@Fabio Zanasi</span> and I have shared a work in progress on arXiv.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18404">String Diagrams for Graded Monoidal Theories with an Application to Imprecise Probability</a></p>
<p>Fabio and I (and the rest of Fabio's group) are interested in studying probabilistic processes using categorical methods and string diagrams in particular. When I arrived in London, we started to look at Jack Liell-Cock and Sam Staton's recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09391">ImP paper</a> with the goal to devise some graphical method of reasoning about imprecise probability, and we partially achieved this.</p>
<p>First, we used the existing axiomatization of finite stochastic matrices (with the Kronecker product) on powers of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">2</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6444em;"></span><span class="mord">2</span></span></span></span> from his previous <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14701">paper</a> with Robin, Mateo,  and Alexandra. The diagrams in that paper are understood as probabilistic circuits (carrying probabilistic bits). Then, we added vertical wires that would carry nondeterministic bits, we postulated axioms that would describe the interaction, and we showed how the diagrams we obtained precisely correspond to morphisms in the category <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="bold">B</mi><mi mathvariant="bold">I</mi><mi mathvariant="bold">m</mi><mi mathvariant="bold">P</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{BImP}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6861em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathbf">BImP</span></span></span></span></span>, a variant of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="bold">I</mi><mi mathvariant="bold">m</mi><mi mathvariant="bold">P</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathbf{ImP}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6861em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathbf">ImP</span></span></span></span></span>, again restricting to powers of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">2</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6444em;"></span><span class="mord">2</span></span></span></span>. Finally, we cleaned up our result and figured that it was an instance of a more abstract result: Theorem 3.4 in the current version.</p>
<p>This is a young paper, and we are still investigating many possible directions, so comments are welcome.</p>

<p>Looks interesting! I want to learn more about how situations involving probability can be studied using categorical methods. I'm specifically interested from the perspective of better understanding probabilistic methods for medical imaging. So I've made a note to take a look at the above paper at some point!</p>

<p>Update before some holidays.</p>
<ol>
<li>I am still really happy with my work at UCL. I am particularly enjoying the vibes in the office because my colleagues work in areas very close to mine, and we get along. I also liked to do more research with string diagrams and combining them with my previous research. Living in London is fun. I will continue to work here for the near future.</li>
<li>Two papers I wrote this year were accepted at MFCS and CALCO. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09229">One</a> on quantitative reasoning with string diagrams (I am currently doing research on a follow-up), and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18404">another one</a> on graded string diagrams. I presented the second one at CALCO in Glasgow in June---this reinforced my belief that CALCO/MFPS are the best conferences in this field, a sentiment echoed by my colleagues---and I will probably present the first at MFCS in Warsaw in August.</li>
<li>On the job applications side, I only got rejections but the way I got these rejections was encouraging for the future. For example, I had very little time to prepare an application to an MCF position in Paris, I got interviewed, and I got ranked (7/~10). People told me this is good outcome for a first go. I will do more applications next year <span aria-label="fingers crossed" class="emoji emoji-1f91e" role="img" title="fingers crossed">:fingers_crossed:</span> </li>
<li>Last week, I taught ZX-calculus to high schoolers (around 15yo) over two days and it was super fun. I did not get to do a lot of outreach or teaching this year. I will try to do more next year because I miss it.</li>
