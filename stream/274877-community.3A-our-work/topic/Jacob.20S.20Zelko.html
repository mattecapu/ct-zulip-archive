<p>It'll take me a little bit to respond to this Jade (holiday season here where I am at -- family craziness ensuing accordingly). Would you mind sharing a bit more about your surprise and thoughts in the interim? To give a first pass at an answer, this is more an attempt at exploring how this could be useful in the context of my work and research. It's an open question that I am pursuing at the moment.</p>

<p>Hey <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="276037">@Jade Master</span> ! I was thinking some more on your question:</p>
<p>So for my research, I have been working in the domain of observational health research which uses as a data source, retrospective data like patient medical claims, electronic health records, etc. A couple significant components to this research has been 1) Structuring this data in a meaningful and standardized way 2) Developing definitions of disease using a variety of medical ontologies  and 3) Extracting patient cohorts from this data based on 1 and 2 to draw potential conclusions in the context of retrospective studies. 1 has been somewhat solved in my space thanks to a format known as the OMOP Common Data Model which has been adopted internationally for working with this sort of data. 2 and 3 are very much an open questions that I am exploring and working on.</p>

<p>In truth, I am still very nascent in my understandings of category theory and am openly exploring how category theory could be used in work such as this. Some things that I have been openly exploring within intersecting observational health research and category theory are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Describing disease definitions using pullbacks into different medical ontologies to reconstruct disease definitions across different studies</li>
<li>Exploring the use of ontology logs to describe patients matching to a specific disease definition (began to more rigorously explore this thought here: <a href="#narrow/stream/229199-learning.3A-questions/topic/on.20the.20concept.20of.20ologs/near/287968145">https://categorytheory.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/229199-learning.3A-questions/topic/on.20the.20concept.20of.20ologs/near/287968145</a>) </li>
<li>Thinking around CatLab with how I could use a combination of ACSets and Directed Wiring Diagrams to represent my study and chain my work together with other collaborators I work with</li>
</ol>
<p>I apologize if the above sounds entirely inane or puerile but I can't help but feel there is something here when approached from a category theory sense. For me, disease definitions boil down in some cases to sets and family of sets that work very well within the category of <strong>Set</strong>, there feels to be a relationship I can develop between disease definitions and the medical ontologies that were used, and I would love to someday have the ability to treat a given observational study as almost "filters" (in a signal processing sense) to create novel studies on patients (e.g. say a study A exists that characterizes depression across age group and race and a study B that characterizes sexual minorities, it would be so cool to compose A and B together to create a study C that characterizes depression across sexual minorities' age group and race).</p>

<p>Good luck!   I don't know where you're planning to go to grad school.  If you get a math PhD in the US, you'll typically take 2 years of courses and going to seminars, learning lots of math and pondering which advisor to work with, before starting your thesis.  If you get a math PhD in the UK you'll typically start writing your PhD right away.</p>

<p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>I have a big personal announcement that has been in the works for quite a while: I just got accepted into the Applied Mathematics Master's Program at Northeastern University and I will be starting this Fall 2023 in Boston. Additionally, I will be joining Northeastern's Roux Institute as a trainee and affiliate for their first ever student cohort. I'll be leaving Georgia Tech Research Institute and the Centers for Disease Control soon and relocate to Boston sometime this summer to begin my studies later this Fall. I am extremely excited about this opportunity to intersect my work in health informatics with various fields of applied mathematics!</p>
<p>I am working on transitioning from my background as a biomedical engineer and research engineer into an applied mathematics student role. I've been trying to prepare my brain to think more like a mathematician and gain fundamental skills mathematicians should have. I've had some background in maths due to my engineering training (partial and ordinary differential equations, linear algebra, SIR modeling, calculus, etc.) but not from the unique mathematician point of view. Are there any books or resources you all would suggest I look into or read? Another way of phrasing that question is if you had to start your mathematics journey over again, what resources or tools would you recommend to your past self?</p>
<p>Thanks folks! </p>
<p>P.S. I have been working through some resources/skills for the past couple months and am happy to share if that would help with providing thoughts.</p>

<p>When I came into mathematics from a computer science background, I started in abstract algebra. It's a different way of thinking than either discrete math or "engineering math" (i.e. diff eqs) and thus is good for expanding your mind. I recommend <a href="https://bookstore.ams.org/view?ProductCode=GSM/104">https://bookstore.ams.org/view?ProductCode=GSM/104</a> for a good intro/reference that is category theoretic, but I would also encourage you to go and take advantage of the time you have to learn things slowly in your master's, and take either an undergrad or graduate course in algebra.</p>
<p>It's probably not something that you would naturally come across in an applied math master's, but it will give you a leg up to have a solid understanding of algebra; you'll come out with a different perspective on things than you would otherwise.</p>

<p>Hey <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="275920">@John Baez</span> -- thanks for all the thoughts here and kind words! Reading your blog post makes me giddy as this is a tool that I was thinking about making myself but you already have it laid out so nicely; a kind of fundamental math learner's road map! I am beyond excited to be starting in this journey in a more formal way. The CT community really played a role in the decision as well as I kept thinking, "If only I had more time to study X" or "If only I knew more about Y" as I read through all the amazing conversations here. It dawned on me that, "wait, why don't I just go to grad school to study these things?" and the rest has been history!</p>

<p>Hey folks! I am excited to share a paper pre-print that I wrote for IEEE Computer Based Medical Systems was just released on arXiv here: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06504">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06504</a> If I were to explain the niche of the paper and how it helps in "the literature", it provides a series of suggestions on interdisciplinary teams to effectively develop phenotype definitions thoughtfully and equitably across the greater health informatics community (not just for OHDSI) regardless of whether they are an engineer, clinician, software developer, or public health policy expert.</p>
<p>A dream that I have further down the road is to more represent such definitions of disease using things like Directed Wiring Diagrams and Petri Nets in the exciting ways that folks at Topos and University of Florida have been doing (like Drs. Sophie Libkind, James Fairbanks, Evan Patterson, and David Spivak). I've been playing a lot with Ontology Logs as communication tool as well in my free time to see how effective it could be as an explanation tool or visual for interdiscplinary teams. My thoughts on its use in my world of health informatics are still pending! </p>
<p>Either way, I am intending to write a blog post that goes along with this paper to make it more broadly accessible. Let me know if you have any thoughts or questions on that paper; happy to chat! Especially on what could be possible with intersecting health informatics with ACT!</p>

<p>Lately, with very warm thanks to John Baez, Owen Lynch and Robin Piedeleu, I have embarked some on studying petri net theory via John's and Jacob Biamonte's book, <em>Quantum Techniques for Stochastic Mechanics</em>. I have found it extremely fascinating -- especially seeing the analogies between what might be considered "traditional system dynamics" modeling and quantum field theoretic approaches. What has been the most shocking to me is seeing just how much analogy there is from quantum field theory to perhaps  "mundane problems": who knew that you could use creation and annihilation operators to model catching fish or bunny growth population? <span aria-label="fishing" class="emoji emoji-1f3a3" role="img" title="fishing">:fishing:</span> <span aria-label="rabbit" class="emoji emoji-1f407" role="img" title="rabbit">:rabbit:</span></p>

<p>Over the past 3 years, I have been thinking hard about how to bring ACT perspectives into public health. This week, I gave an invited talk in NYC at the City University of New York Graduate Center on the culmination of my recent maths research endeavors on the emerging applied research field of compositional public health. This field is extremely early and I am actively involved with defining the vision of this space as well as developing it. Here is the talk abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Compositional public health is an emerging research field that exists to address the complexity in public health responses. The field lies at the intersection of category theory, epidemiology, and engineering and utilizes tools from applied category theory for public health applications. This talk will present the motivation of this field, an overview of the mathematics involved in its approaches, current state of the art, live demonstrations, and future research directions within this developing field.</em></p>

<p>Finally, let me know what you all think! Very much open to feedback and thoughts on how to improve, ways to collaborate or get involved, or questions you all have! I must explore further on sheaf &amp; topos theory in compositional public health; too much to read and too little time! <span aria-label="sob" class="emoji emoji-1f62d" role="img" title="sob">:sob:</span></p>

<p>I have some fun news! I was accepted to the <a href="https://aimath.org">American Institute of Mathematics</a> workshop on <strong><a href="https://aimath.org/workshops/upcoming/formalmodel/">Formal scientific modeling: a case study in global health</a> </strong>this January! I'll be there with other participants under Nina Fefferman, Tim Hosgood's, and Mary Lou Zeeman's leadership! Super excited as I am eager to gain additional perspectives and continue threads of work <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="318832">@Nathaniel Osgood</span> and I have been exploring over the past year.</p>

<p>Additionally, joint work I did with Nate on sketching compositional public health applications was accepted to the 2025 OHDSI Global Symposium. This is a health informatics and clinical informatics venue first and foremost. I am excited to be presenting there on ideas to see what resonates, what is confusing, and what is exciting to a general audience who do not have a category theoretic background. No doubt a lot of insights to be had!</p>

<p>If you're feeling too busy, it can be useful to ask "which important things will happen regardless of whether I get involved, and which are likely to happen only if I do them?"   Anything that will happen even if you don't do it, you don't need to do.</p>
<p>Of course if there's a race you want to win, you need to hurry up to win it.  But many of the best things to do are not at all like races with lots of contestants.</p>
