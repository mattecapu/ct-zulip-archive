<p>Today <a href="https://epochai.org/">Epoch AI</a> has <a href="https://x.com/EpochAIResearch/status/1854996368814936250">announced</a> a math benchmark to test AI systems comprised of extremely hard problems in research math.</p>
<p>You can check <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04872">the paper</a>, the <a href="https://x.com/EpochAIResearch/status/1854996368814936250">announcement video</a>, or <a href="https://epochai.org/frontiermath">their website</a> for more details, including interviews with Borcherds, Tao, Chen, and Gowers (!!)</p>
<p>Something I thought the people here on Zulip would appreciate to know is that some of the problems in the benchmark were specifically on category theory :)</p>

<p>I wish I could, but since data contamination¹ is an issue, I unfortunately can't go into more details than saying category theory was one of the areas which the benchmark aimed to cover (as mentioned in the paper)</p>
<p>¹i.e. when problems and solutions of a benchmark get leaked and models end up being trained on those, so they end up being able to solve them by merely reproducing what they have seem</p>

<p>I think (judging from the paper) that the allowed kinds of solutions were single numbers, finite sets of numbers, or <code>SymPy</code> objects (so e.g. things like <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>e</mi><mrow><mi>ln</mi><mo>⁡</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>2</mn><mi>π</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">e^{\ln(2\pi)}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.888em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal">e</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.888em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mop mtight"><span class="mtight">l</span><span class="mtight">n</span></span><span class="mopen mtight">(</span><span class="mord mtight">2</span><span class="mord mathnormal mtight" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">π</span><span class="mclose mtight">)</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>, matrices, etc.).

<p>At least, it seems hard to quantify how strongly you believe that the model is generating the correct infinite stream, unless it gives you a program that produces that stream that you can put in bisimulation with a known-correct one. But that would add a whole lot of trouble!</p>

<p>I saw the paper linked on Mathstodon, and was having a hard time imagining what on earth the CT problems could be. That the answers are so highly constrained makes the whole exercise somehow differently interesting for me. Now I'm even more mystified as to the kinds of problems they could be.</p>
<p>I have been contacted more than once through various channels by various companies wanting me to use my expertise in mathematics to come up with problems for the purposes of AI research — but the kinds of problems they are after are not ones I really consider (IMO-style, mostly).</p>

<p>Obviously we can't know what the specific problems are, but how about giving a general hint of the type of problem? Something like "enumerate the number of non-isomorphic/equivalent groupoids with n morphisms" seems like a problem that falls in the realm of "having a numeric answer", but also feels less like category theory.</p>

<p>Let me see if I can make up a semi-compelling example since Emily can't share much here. Aiming for a lower level than this dataset, more like a problem you could give in a graduate-level course, how about "How many functors between the following two very small categories are such that left Kan extension along them is full?"</p>

<p>Now, depending on which categories you chose in my problem the ratio of category theory to combinatorics could be arbitrary. It'd be interesting to try to get more CT and less combinatorics.</p>

<p>This is just on my mind because I recently had to characterize which functors have full left Kan extensions, and it was quite doable but didn't seem to be findable in the literature.</p>

<p>This sounds quite interesting! Were you after general conditions for the left Kan extensions to be full, or was the setup somewhat specific?</p>

<p>Oh, that sounds really interesting! Did you end up writing this down? I've been gathering similar such conditions on Clowder¹, and would love to have a look at it!</p>
<p>(¹More specifically, Item (f) of Item 4 of Proposition 8.5.1.1.2 (as of writing), <a href="https://www.clowderproject.com/tag/0116.html">here</a>)</p>

<p>I've found AI tools have been surprisingly useful lately (at least compared to GPT4, which was pretty much unusable for math when it first came out). A while ago they actually helped me compute a coend which I otherwise would be struggling with for a long time.</p>

<p>I've also found them to be pretty useful for stuff like generating programs to explicitly compute traces of categories, like <a href="https://github.com/topological-modular-forms/divisibility-posets-trace/tree/main">here</a> (context: <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/482041/what-is-the-trace-of-the-category-of-divisibility-posets">MO 482041</a>)</p>
