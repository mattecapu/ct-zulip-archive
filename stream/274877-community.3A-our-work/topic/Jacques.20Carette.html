<p>This has been out for a month and half, but I was just catching up to stuff on here, so figured I would post: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01885">The Quantum Effect: A Recipe for QuantumPi</a> with abstract:</p>
<p>Free categorical constructions characterise quantum computing as the combination of two copies of a reversible classical model, glued by the complementarity equations of classical structures. This recipe effectively constructs a computationally universal quantum programming language from two copies of Pi, the internal language of rig groupoids. The construction consists of Hughes' arrows. Thus answer positively the question whether a computational effect exists that turns reversible classical computation into quantum computation: the quantum effect. Measurements can be added by layering a further effect on top. Our construction also enables some reasoning about quantum programs (with or without measurement) through a combination of classical reasoning and reasoning about complementarity. </p>
<p>with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="301248">@Chris Heunen</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="452564">@Robin Kaarsgaard</span> and Amr Sabry. Quite a lot of the paper is <a href="https://github.com/JacquesCarette/QuantumPi">implemented in Agda</a> - it is possible to run small QuantumPi programs as well as do reasoning on them.</p>
<p>Rig categories seems to be popular right now, so here's one more item that uses them, along with a bunch of other categorical constructions.</p>
