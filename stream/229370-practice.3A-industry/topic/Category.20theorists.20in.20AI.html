<p>Here's a draft of a blog article I want to write.   What are the main other organizations using category theory for AI?</p>
<h2>Category Theorists in AI</h2>
<p>I avoid working on AI and machine learning, both because it's a hot topic, with all the usual problems that brings, and because these tools are mainly being used to make rich and powerful people richer and more powerful---with all the usual problems <em>that</em> brings.</p>
<p>However, I like to pay attention to how category theorists are getting jobs in the AI industry, and what they're doing---in part because I know and like many of these people, and in part because I wonder what they will do for AI, and what work on AI will do to them.</p>
<p>Here are some stories I've been following intermittently:</p>
<h3>Symbolica</h3>
<p>When Musk and his AI head <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrej_Karpathy">Andrej Karpathy</a> didn't listen to their engineer <a href="https://blog.infinity.ai/ep-3-our-approach-to-ai-is-broken-george-morgan-3053cb18c7f7">George Morgan's</a> worry that current techniques in deep learning couldn't "scale to infinity and solve all problems," Morgan left Tesla and started a company called <a href="https://www.symbolica.ai/">Symbolica</a> to work on symbolic reasoning.   The billionaire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinod_Khosla">Vinod Khosla</a> gave him $2 million in seed money.  He began with an approach based on hypergraphs, but then these researchers wrote a position paper that pushed the company in a different direction:</p>
<p>&bull; <a href="https://www.brunogavranovic.com/">Bruno Gavranović</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/paul-roy-lessard/home?authuser=0">Paul Lessard</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DdFjaEEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Andrew Dudzik</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tamara-von-glehn-66a703175/?originalSubdomain=uk">Tamara von Glehn</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WL9vouMAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">João G. M. Araújo</a> and <a href="https://petar-v.com/">Petar Veličković</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15332">Position: Categorical Deep Learning is an Algebraic Theory of All Architectures</a></p>
<p>Kholsa liked the new direction and invested $30 million more in Symbolica.  At Gavranovic and Lessard's suggestion Morgan hired category theorists including <a href="https://dom-verity.github.io/pages/CV.html">Dominic Verity</a> and <a href="https://www.strath.ac.uk/staff/ghanineilprof/">Neil Ghani</a>.</p>
<p>But Morgan was never fully sold on category theory: he still wanted to pursue his hypergraph approach. Aafter a while, continued disagreements between Morgan and the category theorists took its toll.   He fired some, even having one summarily removed from his office.  Another resigned voluntarily.  Due to nondisclosure agreements, these people no longer talk publicly about what went down.</p>
<p>So one moral for category theorists, or indeed anyone with a good idea: after your idea helps someone get a lot of money, they may be able to fire you.</p>
<h3>Topos UK</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidad/?originalSubdomain=uk">David Dalrymple</a> is running a program on "safeguarded AI" at the UK agency ARIA (the Advanced Research + Invention agency) and he is very interested in using category theory for this purpose.  </p>
<p>This program is funding a new branch of the Topos Institute at Oxford, called Topos UK.  The previous Topos Institute is a math research institute in Berkeley with a focus on category theory.  Three young category theorists there---<a href="https://slibkind.github.io/">Sophie Libkind</a>, <a href="http://davidjaz.com/">David Jaz Myers</a> and <a href="https://owenlynch.org/">Owen Lynch</a>---wrote a proposal called "Double categorical systems theory for safeguarded AI", which got funded by ARIA.  </p>
<p>It looks like David Jaz Myers, Owen Lynch, <a href="https://thosgood.com/">Tim Hosgood</a>, <a href="https://jsiqueira.owlstown.net">José Siquiera</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=55dzbRgAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Xiaoyan Li</a> will be working at Topos UK.</p>
<h3>Glaive</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://glaive-research.org/">Glasgow Lab for AI Verification</a> or 'Glaive' is a non-profit limited company focusing on applying category theory to AI verification.  The people working for it include <a href="https://dylanbraithwaite.github.io/">Dylan Braithwaite</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/jadeedenstarmaster/home">Jade Master</a>, <a href="https://zanzix.github.io/">Zans Mihejevs</a>, <a href="https://andrevidela.com/">André Videla</a>, <a href="https://glaive-research.org/Resources/CV-41.pdf">Neil Ghani</a> and <a href="https://julesh.com/">Jules Hedges</a>.</p>
<p>Like the Topos UK, Glaive is supported by ARIA.  I don't know enough about what they're doing.</p>

<p>Thanks, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="302507">@David Corfield</span> - I figured the Safeguarded AI program was bigger than what I've seen, but I hadn't figured out how to find out its full extent.

<h6>Axiomatic Theories of String Diagrams for Categories of Probabilistic Processes</h6>
<p><strong>Fabio Zanasi, University College London</strong></p>
<p>This project aims to provide complete axiomatic theories of string diagrams for significant categories of probabilistic processes. Fabio will then use these theories to develop compositional methods of analysis for different kinds of probabilistic graphical models.</p>

<h6>Safety: Core Representation Underlying Safeguarded AI</h6>
<p><strong>Ohad Kammar, University of Edinburgh</strong></p>
<p>Team: Justus Matthiesen; Jesse Sigal, University of Edinburgh</p>
<p>This project looks to design a calculus that utilises the semantic structure of quasi-Borel spaces, introduced in ‘A convenient category for higher-order probability theory‘. Ohad and his team will develop the internal language of quasi-Borel spaces as a “semantic universe” for stochastic processes, define syntax that is amenable to type-checking and versioning, and interface with other teams in the programme—either to embed other formalisms as sub-calculi in quasi-Borel spaces, or vice versa (e.g. for imprecise probability).</p>

<h6>Philosophical Applied Category Theory</h6>
<p><strong>David Corfield, Independent Researcher</strong></p>
<p>This project plans to overcome the limitations of traditional philosophical formalisms by integrating interdisciplinary knowledge through applied category theory. In collaboration with other TA1.1 Creators, David will explore graded modal logic, type theory, and causality, and look to develop the conceptual tools to support the broader Safeguarded AI programme.</p>

<h6>Double Categorical Systems Theory for Safeguarded AI</h6>
<p><strong>David Jaz Myers, Topos Research UK</strong></p>
<p>Team: Owen Lynch; Sophie Libkind; David Spivak, Topos Research UK; James Fairbanks, University of Florida</p>
<p>This project aims to utilise Double Categorical Systems Theory (DCST) as a mathematical framework to facilitate collaboration between stakeholders, domain experts, and computer aides in co-designing an explainable and auditable model of an autonomous AI system’s deployment environment. David + team will expand this modelling framework to incorporate formal verification of the system’s safety and reliability, study the verification of model-surrogacy of hybrid discrete-continuous systems, and develop serialisable data formats for representing and operating on models, all with the goal of preparing the DCST framework for broader adoption across the Safeguarded AI Programme.</p>

<h6>Monoidal Coalgebraic Metrics</h6>
<p><strong>Filippo Bonchi, University of Pisa</strong></p>
<p>Filippo and team intend to establish a robust mathematical framework that extends beyond the metrics expressible in quantitative algebraic theories and coalgebras over metric spaces. By shifting from Cartesian to a monoidal setting, this group will examine these metrics using algebraic contexts (to enhance syntax foundations) and coalgebraic contexts provide robust quantitative semantics and effective techniques for establishing quantitative bounds on black-box behaviours), ultimately advancing the scope of quantitative reasoning in these domains.</p>

<h6>Doubly Categorical Systems Logic: A Theory of Specification Languages</h6>
<p><strong>Matteo Capucci, Independent Researcher</strong></p>
<p>This project aims to develop a logical framework to classify and interoperate various logical systems created to reason about complex systems and their behaviours, guided by Doubly Categorical Systems Theory (DCST). Matteo’s goal is to study the link between the compositional and morphological structure of systems and their behaviour, specifically in the way logic pertaining these two components works, accounting for both dynamic and temporal features. Such a path will combine categorical approaches to both logic and systems theory.</p>
<h6>True Categorical Programming for Composable Systems Total</h6>
<p><strong>Jade Master + Zans Mihejevs, Glasgow Lab for AI Verification (GLAIVE)</strong></p>
<p>Team: Andre Videla; Dylan Braithwaite, GLAIVE</p>
<p>This project intends to develop a type theory for categorical programming that enables encoding of key mathematical structures not currently supported by existing languages. These structures include functors, universal properties, Kan extensions, lax (co)limits, and Grothendieck constructions. Jade + team are aiming to create a type theory that accurately translates categorical concepts into code without compromise, and then deploy this framework to develop critical theorems related to the mathematical foundations of Safeguarded AI.</p>
<h6>Employing Categorical Probability Towards Safe AI</h6>
<p><strong>Sam Staton, University of Oxford</strong></p>
<p>Team: Pedro Amorim; Elena Di Lavore; Paolo Perrone; Mario Román; Ruben Van Belle; Younesse Kaddar; Jack Liell-Cock; Owen Lynch, University of Oxford</p>
<p>Sam + team will look to employ categorical probability toward key elements essential for world modelling in the Safeguarded AI Programme. They will investigate imprecise probability (which provides bounds on probabilities of unsafe behaviour), and stochastic dynamical systems for world modelling, and then look to create a robust foundation of semantic version control to support the above elements.</p>
<h6>Syntax and Semantics for Multimodal Petri Nets</h6>
<p><strong>Amar Hadzihasanovic, Tallinn University of Technology</strong></p>
<p>Team: Diana Kessler, Tallinn University of Technology</p>
<p>Amar + team will develop a combinatorial and diagrammatic syntax, along with categorical semantics, for multimodal Petri Nets. These Nets will model dynamical systems that undergo mode or phase transitions, altering their possible places, events, and interactions. Their goal is to create a category-theoretic framework for mathematical modelling and safe-by-design specification of dynamical systems and process theories which exhibit multiple modes of operation.</p>
