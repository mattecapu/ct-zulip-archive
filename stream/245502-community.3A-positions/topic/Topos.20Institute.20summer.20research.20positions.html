<p>Come spend the summer at the Topos Institute! For early-career researchers, we’re excited to open up applications for our summer research associate (RA) program.</p>

<p>Summer RAs are an important part of life at Topos — they help explore new directions relevant to Topos projects, and they bring new ideas, energy, and expertise to our research groups. This year we’ll welcome a new cohort of RAs to our offices in Berkeley, CA, with the program running from June to August.</p>

<p>RAs will be responsible for performing an in-depth research or teaching project, mentored by a Topos faculty mentor or advisor. This year possible mentors may include Conal Elliott, Valeria de Paiva, Evan Patterson, Dana Scott, David Spivak, and others. RAs will work closely with their mentor to define and pursue a research project.</p>

<p>Good: Dana Scott is excited about mentoring a project! He's suggested a project about a recent preprint of Peter Hines 'On strict reflexive extensionality in compact closed categories', but seems open to other topics too. So you could get paid to spend a summer learning from Dana Scott!</p>

<p>By the way, someone on Mathstodon asked why "geometry of interaction" is listed as a possible research topic.   Who is doing that?   (I associate it with French mathematicians, linear logic, etc.)</p>

<p>Among non French people, I know Phil Scott and Abramsky who worked on that. As far as I understand GoI is something advanced based on linear logic such as Ludics which is even more obscure to me, or differential linear logic that nobody know unfortunately and yet other things, so the people who work on them obviously know well linear logic.

<p>Ichiro Hasuo published a paper a few years ago about using GoI as a semantics for higher-order quantum computing. IIRC Claudia Faggian and Benoît Valiron, <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="296986">@Benoit Valiron</span>, used tools inspired from GoI for probabilistic/quantum computing too.<br>
Girard was inspired by quantum physics when he introduced some more recent formulation of GoI based on Von Neumann algebras.<br>
As <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="428716">@Jean-Baptiste Vienney</span> mentioned, Abramsky also worked on it, connecting it to the Int construction.<br>
There is also a link with abstract machines that is used in some of the work above, but I don't know enough about the topic to really say more than that.<br>
For the link with QC, I think I remember that Kostia Chardonnet has done some work in that direction too.</p>

<p>To elaborate, I somehow forgot that there is precedent for this: one of our RAs last summer is not a US national but is a PhD student at a US university, and the visa she obtained through her university sufficed to employ her for the summer. So that's at least one way this can happen. I'm sure there are other ways but I'm not knowledgeable enough to advise on that.</p>

<p>All this information about geometry of interaction is great... but it doesn't answer the question I was trying to ask: <strong>who at the Topos Institute would mentor research assistants at Topos wanting to work on the geometry of interactions?</strong></p>

<p>Last summer Dana Scott mentored two RAs through this program, and he <em>might</em> mentor again this summer. I think that geometry of interaction is there because Dana has interest in it. But Dana is interested in many things, so I'm not sure how helpful that is as a guide to possible topics.</p>

<p>I doubt the Topos Institute in the US will be able to get visas for foreign students as long as Trump is president - getting visas is harder and harder!   It's also hard to get visas in the UK, though easier.  </p>
<p>If Topos Oxford ever gets summer research positions, they'll be announced in such a way that you'll probably hear about them if you follow this Zulip and/or my blog Azimuth and/or the n-Category Cafe.   Right now Topos UK is pushing hard on the <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2025/11/19/safeguarded-ai-part-2/">Safeguarded AI</a> project.</p>

<p>visas (and the other requirements that surround them) are indeed highly non-trivial, but I'm working very hard on trying to figure things out! as for summer positions, we actually did have a student this summer just gone (see <a href="https://topos.institute/blog/2025-09-26-free-pltl-algebras-and-hyperdoctrines/">https://topos.institute/blog/2025-09-26-free-pltl-algebras-and-hyperdoctrines/</a>) but we're not yet ready to announce anything about next summer just yet (and i can't promise that we will, at least for this year). there's a lot going on under the surface, beyond the ARIA programme, it's just that nothing is fully concrete yet, so we've yet to start talking about it much! :-)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good to know it will at least be discussed! Thank you for trying to make this happen.</p>
