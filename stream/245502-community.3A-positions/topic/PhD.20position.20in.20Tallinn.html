<p>I am looking for a PhD student to work with me on a project at the intersection of</p>
<ul>
<li>type theory,</li>
<li>combinatorial topology,</li>
<li>higher category theory,</li>
<li>rewriting theory;<br>
a background in one or more of these areas is a bonus, but a strong foundation in mathematics and/or theoretical computer science will do.</li>
</ul>
<p>Starting date is as soon as possible; you need to have a Master's degree by the start of your PhD (but are invited to apply even if you have not completed the requirements yet).<br>
The expected PhD study time at TalTech is 4 years. A PhD is a salaried position and is topped with an additional tax-free stipend from the department, which ensures a good living standard in Estonia.</p>
<p>There is a vibrant, ever-growing community of category theorists, type theorists, and theoretical computer scientists at TalTech.<br>
The PhD candidate would join the Compositionality group, which besides me, currently includes Pawel Sobocinski, Fosco Loregian, Priyaa Varshinee Srinivasan, Alessandro Di Giorgio, Callum Reader, Diana Kessler, Eigil Rischel, and a multitude of PhD students.<br>
We also work closely together with the Logic and Semantics group, which consists of Tarmo Uustalu, Niccolò Veltri, Nathanael Arkor, Bryce Clarke, Hellis Tamm, Hendrik Maarand, Silvio Capobianco, and various students.</p>
<p>Tallinn is a beautiful city on the Baltic coast, just opposite Helsinki, which can be reached with a 2hr ferry ride. The TalTech campus is interspersed with forested areas, which cover a large part of the country, contributing to the 2nd best air quality in Europe after its neighbour Finland.<br>
With generous paid parental leave (up to 18 months) and a chart-topping education system, Estonia is a great place for families. In 2024, it became the first country formerly in the Eastern bloc to legalise same-sex marriage. <br>
Candidates from all backgrounds and with all identities are encouraged to apply.</p>
<p>Please write to me either here or via email (<a href="mailto:amar.hadzihasanovic@taltech.ee">amar.hadzihasanovic@taltech.ee</a>) if you want to discuss this further. A formal application is not required at this stage; a CV and expression of interest will suffice.<br>
You are also encouraged to contact former or current PhD students in our group about their experience.</p>

<p>There was an M2 course track with a lot of rewriting and higher category at ENS de Lyon this year. See <a href="http://mathematiques.ens-lyon.fr/medias/fichier/algebra-formalisation_1702642869328-pdf?ID_FICHE=230253">the program here</a>. You should try to contact Stéphane Gaussent to ask whether he can advertise your position. (Unfortunately, I think that most ENS students will have one year of internships between their M2 and their PhDs.)</p>

<p>Thanks! I have never met Stéphane but I know many of the other people involved.</p>
