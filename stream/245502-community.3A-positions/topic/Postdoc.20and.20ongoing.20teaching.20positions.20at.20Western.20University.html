<p>[Note the urgency of the postdoctoral positions mentioned below!]</p>
<p>The University of Western Ontario is hiring, and I'd like to encourage people on this list to apply for positions.  Western is a great place to be mathematically (and otherwise), with lots of activity in homotopy theory, category theory, and other closely related areas.</p>
<p>The list of all positions is at</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mathjobs.org/jobs?joblist-167">https://www.mathjobs.org/jobs?joblist-167</a></p>
<p>but I'll highlight two ads here:</p>
<p>We expect to hire one or more postdoctoral researchers, and the review of these begins on <strong>December 5, 2023</strong>.  Late applications will still be considered, but please apply as soon as possible to ensure that your application is considered:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mathjobs.org/jobs?joblist-167-23315">https://www.mathjobs.org/jobs?joblist-167-23315</a></p>
<p>We also have a Teaching Scholar position, which is intended to be an ongoing position, with a "probationary period" (analogous to being tenure-track) followed by "continuing status" if promoted to Associate Professor.  The deadline is January 15:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mathjobs.org/jobs?joblist-167-23609">https://www.mathjobs.org/jobs?joblist-167-23609</a></p>
<p>People from all areas of math are eligible for both positions.  Western is located in London, Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p>Feel free to contact me with any questions.</p>
