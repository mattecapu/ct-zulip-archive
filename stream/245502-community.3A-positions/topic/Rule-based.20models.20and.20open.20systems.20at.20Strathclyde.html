<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Good news! I've had a grant proposal approved for making some extensions to the Kappa process calculus and implementing them in the KaSim simulator. This means hiring someone who is good at Ocaml (or functional programming in some language, but KaSim is written in Ocaml) to work with me for at least 2 years. There will be a bunch of interesting applications to epidemics, immunology and (for lack of a better term) behavioural economics. This particular someone doesn't need to know those things, we will also hire another someone with domain expertise. It would be useful to know about graph rewriting and/or open systems. This work is very much at the applied end of the ACT spectrum.</p>
<p>Formal advertisement and hiring should happen in the new year, but I'm putting feelers out now. If this all sounds interesting and you think that you might be or know this someone, please drop me a note at <a href="mailto:william.waites@strath.ac.uk">william.waites@strath.ac.uk</a></p>
