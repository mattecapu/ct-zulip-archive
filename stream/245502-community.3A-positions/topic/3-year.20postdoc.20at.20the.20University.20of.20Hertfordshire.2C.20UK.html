<p>Hi, everyone! The Centre of Data Innovation Research at the University of Hertfordshire (United Kingdom) is hiring a 3-year Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Applied Category Theory. Our School has been increasingly interested in the potential of Category Theory in various fields (including mathematical physics, but also computer science and AI) and it would like to start a little ACT research group. What they are ideally looking for is someone who is happy to work with both mathematically-oriented people and data science-oriented people, and to contribute developing the new research group. I hope this sounds interesting.</p>
