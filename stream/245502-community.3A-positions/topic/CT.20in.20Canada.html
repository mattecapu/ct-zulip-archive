<p>How is category theory in Canada, and in Montreal in particular? I am currently browsing through their for PhD programs there. I recently found out about Montreal's CT group, specially at McGill, but some sources suggests it's defunct right now.</p>
<p>edit: I know that Western has a few HoTT oriented faculty, and I know that at least Theo Freyd from Dalhousie/Perimeter uses higher categories in his work.  Also Joyal is emeritus at UdeM. But McGill/UToronto/Concordia (and others) have immense departments, so it's hard to browse through their faculty</p>

<p>I believe it's been defunct for a while; this was already effectively the case when I contacted Marta Bunge 4 years ago inquiring about PhD opportunities in category theory there (that was her assessment at the time, since she was retiring, or at least no longer in a position to take on PhD students).</p>

<p>If he has the same opinions on CT that Mardare (frequent collaborator afaik) has, I see why he didn't mention it. They don't consider themselves category theorists as much as someone working in &lt;put classical math discipline here&gt; wouldn't consider themselves set theorists.</p>

<p>UOttawa has been a thriving center for CT research for many years, with Phil Scott, Rick Blute, Pieter Hofstra, and a steady stream of postdocs and PhD students.  Scott and Blute have recently gone emeritus (but are by no means out of the picture), and Simon Henry was then hired.  I think that's still pretty thriving.</p>

<p>I do think it's true that it's hard to get jobs in pure CT, but the reason is that it's hard to get jobs in <em>any</em> area of pure mathematics.  Young category theorists in Canada are actually doing pretty well at getting jobs.</p>

<p>Myself and some other Canadians I know chose to do our PhDs in Europe/UK because funding for fundemental research in Canada is quite rough... at least at the PhD level.  Years of austerity from right wing governments takes its toll.</p>

<p>No, I have no experience with postdocs in Canada or professorships,.  However, at the PhD level, the main way to get funding is from the NSERC doctoral scholarship and it is very competitive.  If you are going to do a PhD in Canada it would be very much preferable to apply for a project which already has grant money to avoid trying to compete for the NSERC.</p>

<p>The other way to get funded in Canada is to have a supervisor with a large enough NSERC grant that they can support a PhD student. Unfortunately most math profs don't have grants large enough to do that. But many profs in CS do. And there are CS profs who use a lot of category theory. In my own department, two of us (myself and Wolfram Kahl) for sure; there used to be Tom Maibaum too, but he retired.</p>

<p>I now see he doesn't have any gray hair at all.</p>

<p>Maybe not in pictures on the internet, but looking in the mirror recently I've noticed a few :)</p>
<p>For PhD programs in Canada, the three most likely places would be U. Ottawa (Pieter Hofstra, Rick Blute, Phil Scott, Simon Henry), Dalhousie (Peter Selinger, Dorette Pronk), and U. Calgary (Robin Cockett in the CS department, with some category-theory-friendly people like Kristine Bauer in the math department).  My university (Mount Allison) doesn't have a Phd program, but I can supervise PhD students jointly with people at Dalhousie (I previously supervised Evangelia Aleiferi, and am currently supervising Marcello Lanfranchi, both jointly with Dorette).  Brandon University (where Rory is) also doesn't have a PhD in math program, but he may also be able to jointly supervise with others (not sure, would have to contact him).</p>
<p>For postdocs, there has been a fair bit of recent success of category theory people getting national or regional postdoctoral fellowships in Canada: Rory got both an NSERC (national) and AARMS (Atlantic regional) postdoctoral fellowship, JS Lemay currently has an NSERC postdoc (working with me), Jonathan Gallagher just finished an AARMS postdoc (working with Dorette and myself), and Martin Szyld and Geoff Vooys both currently have AARMS postdocs (both working with Dorette).  Michael Lambert is also working with me as a postdoc.  Martti (at Ottawa) and Jason (at Brandon) were mentioned above.  And I just remembered Matt Amy at Dal, who also has an AARMS postdoc!  There's probably some more I'm missing as well...  </p>
<p>For tenure-track positions, unfortunately I don't know of any right now.  I would hope that Calgary, Ottawa, and Dal would continue to hire category-theory-related people, but one never knows how hiring will go.</p>

<p>For postdocs, Neil Jr. Ross and Peter Selinger are offering one at Dalhousie right now. It is in quantum computing with an emphasis on mathematical, logical and categorical techniques. It has been advertised on the categories mailing list so I think it is worth mentioning it.</p>
