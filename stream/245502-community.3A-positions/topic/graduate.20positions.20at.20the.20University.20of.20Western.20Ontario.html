<p>As usual, we have openings for strong graduate applicants in all areas, and I in particular welcome applicants interested in higher categories, homotopy type theory and homotopy theory.  Our department has lots of people working on these topics and many visitors and seminars.  Note that the deadline of February 1 is coming soon, but that applications will continue to be reviewed after that.  Our standard ad is below.</p>
