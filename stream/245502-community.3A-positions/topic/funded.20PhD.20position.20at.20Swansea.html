<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'd like to advertise a funded PhD opportunity in the CS theory group at Swansea University, to be supervised by myself. The provisional topic would be exploring connections between (linear) λ-calculi and automata theory, hopefully using semantic methods. The official adverts detailing some <em>possible</em> research directions is there <a href="https://www.swansea.ac.uk/postgraduate/scholarships/research/computer-science-epsrc-su-phd-comparing-2022-rs125.php">https://www.swansea.ac.uk/postgraduate/scholarships/research/computer-science-epsrc-su-phd-comparing-2022-rs125.php</a> (the deadline for application is July 29th, which is relatively soon)</p>
<p>(The connections to CT here would be mainly via the categorical semantics of linear logic. With @<strong>Nguyễn Lê Thành Dũng</strong>  we had some successes proving some results in this area by freely building up some simple categories via a bunch of free constructions and noticing that we could equip those with a smcc structure and relate this to known transducers models; see in particular <a href="https://nguyentito.eu/thesis.pdf">https://nguyentito.eu/thesis.pdf</a> chapters 4&amp;6. Among other things to be done that are somewhat related to CT, we think there are similar opportunities to use semantic evaluation arguments based on the non-commutative version of the <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">I</mi><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">n</mi><mi mathvariant="sans-serif">t</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\mathsf{Int}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6944em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathsf">Int</span></span></span></span></span> construction)</p>
<p>(Also I feel I should plug Eike Neumann who has also a call open with the same funding scheme about reachability problems and exact real number computability with the same sort of deadline/arrangement that sounds very interesting :)<br>

<p>If that sounds enticing, informal enquiries are very welcome! I can be reached via email (<a href="mailto:c.pradic@swansea.ac.uk">c.pradic@swansea.ac.uk</a>), or one can try PMing me here if that is easier (I should also be around at ACT in Glasgow this year).<br>
Also happy to discuss other project ideas I would be suited to supervise (I suppose one can get some idea of what other areas I work in by browsing through my personal webpage <a href="https://cs-web.swan.ac.uk/~cpradic/">https://cs-web.swan.ac.uk/~cpradic/</a> but I mostly do logic, automata and type theory I guess), and feel free to forward to anyone who might be interested.</p>

<p>Hi,<br>
Just to let you know that the position is still open, with the "new" advert being here <a href="https://www.swansea.ac.uk/postgraduate/scholarships/research/computer-science-epsrc-su-phd-comparing-2022-rs181.php">https://www.swansea.ac.uk/postgraduate/scholarships/research/computer-science-epsrc-su-phd-comparing-2022-rs181.php</a> and the last possible starting date being July 1st. Once again, there are words there about some topics, but happy to discuss whatever thing I might be able to usefully supervise.<br>
Unfortunately, I believe the dreadful UKRI quota on international applicants has long been reached, so only UK applicants are eligible now :/</p>
