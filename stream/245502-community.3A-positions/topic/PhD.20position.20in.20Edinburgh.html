<p>Dear list members,</p>
<p>I have a fully funded PhD position in the area of modelling of molecular interactions in cells at Edinburgh Napier University. The approach that is intended is aligned with category theory.</p>
<p>The link to the advert is:<br>
PhD Studentship in Algebraic Modelling of Molecular Interactions in Biological Cells at Edinburgh Napier University (<a href="http://jobs.ac.uk">jobs.ac.uk</a>)<br>
<a href="https://www.jobs.ac.uk/job/CQZ551/phd-studentship-in-algebraic-modelling-of-molecular-interactions-in-biological-cells">https://www.jobs.ac.uk/job/CQZ551/phd-studentship-in-algebraic-modelling-of-molecular-interactions-in-biological-cells</a></p>
<p>The application deadline is 31st July.</p>
<p>Project summary:<br>
There has been active research over the last 60 years on modelling molecular interactions through various computational approaches (Maturana &amp; Varela, 1980; Rashevsky, 1969; Rosen, 1991; Ganti, 2003; Banzhaf &amp; Yamamoto, 2015). Fontana &amp; Buss (1994) proposed a lambda calculus based approach to describe molecular interactions and molecules, while the proposal of Rosen (1991) offers an approach that is similar to category theory description of living systems. The PhD thesis of Elie Adam (2017) provides a very interesting category theory based approach to describe behaviour of interacting systems, while an earlier approach to use category theory for modelling systems is provided by Goguen (1992). Lambda calculus and category theory have close links (Scott, 1982), however these have not been explored much in the context of modelling of molecular interactions, with the exception of Andras (2011), which points to the importance of this link and suggests that appropriate models of molecular interactions must be infinite at the scale of categories.</p>
<p>The PhD project will aim to follow the approach in Andras (2011) and build on Fontana &amp; Buss (1994) and on the category theory based modelling ideas in Adam (2017) to develop a new algebraic modelling of molecular interactions in biological cells. We will develop a modelling framework for molecular interactions in general first and then we will look at more detail at molecular interactions that happen within biological cells and aim to capture the difference between systems of molecular interactions that happen within cells and those that can happen without requiring biological cells. The modelling work will include both theoretical and computational modelling, aiming to find an appropriate computational implementation framework that allows the simulation of molecular interaction systems described by the theoretical modelling approach.</p>

<p>Candidate Profile<br>
Candidates should have a first class Honours degree or Masters degree at Distinction level. The ideal candidate will have a strong grounding in mathematics with a good understanding of category theory and related computational and modelling tools and ideally also some understanding of the theory of computing, including lambda calculus, type theory and pi-calculus or related topics. The ideal candidate should also have an interest in biology and in particular cellular biology or biochemistry. A first degree or an MSc in computer science or mathematics is preferred, but other related areas will be also considered (e.g. physics, chemistry, biology).</p>
