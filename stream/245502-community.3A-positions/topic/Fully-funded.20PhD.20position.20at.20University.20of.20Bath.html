<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have funding available to hire a PhD student to work on topics such as categorical logic, programming language theory or categorical probability theory. Here's a description of the position <a href="https://pedrohaa.github.io/phd@Bath.pdf">link</a>. The student is not expected to be well-versed in any of these topics by the time they start their PhD, but should have enough mathematical maturity to be able to learn them throughout their PhD.</p>
<p>The department of Computer Science at the University of Bath has a very active, and expanding, theory group — four new lecturers have been hired over the last year. The position is fully funded for the entire duration of the program (3.5 years) and open to international as well as home students, meaning both tuition fees and a living stipend are covered. The student is expected to start the program in September 2026.</p>
<p>The application deadline is 15/Dec/2025. If this position interests you, please reach out to me.</p>
